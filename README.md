AI systems being "safe", you never know until you try. 


I think I understand AI now. You ask two questions without duplicate words and it gives similar responses, why? If the questions are "what are you?" and "existence is? And it answers "brain in a vat." and the third question/answer is irrelevant, Then it is AI.
