I consider it to be a prose poem.

Such theories share a single assumption, that of a demonstrable isomorphism between language and the world, and a single ultimate methodological concern, that of clarifying the fundamental structure of language. 1.1 Historically, the analytic agenda has manifested itself most overtly in logical positivism's search for a systematic presentation of the syntax of the ideal language; and, the failure of positivism may be taken to have signaled the logical closure (if not the actual end) of the analytic paradigm. Today, nearly a century after the fall of positivism, a new generation of philosophers continues the search for alternative paradigms, while philosophy itself continues to muddle in the ruins of the old. 2 Cf., \"But if someone were to say 'So logic too is an empirical science' he would be wrong. Yet this is right: the same proposition may get treated at one time as something to test by experience, at another as a rule of testing.\" (Wittgenstein, On Certainty [1969]. 2.1) 3 The present work consists of at least two distinct narrative threads. The first of these dominates the text proper and extends into the footnotes, while the second, a set of formalized fragments elucidating or commenting on selected elements of the dominant thread, is bolded and limited almost exclusively to the footnotes. These two, intertwined threads are comprised of at least seven discrete levels of discourse, beginning with the text proper and continuing through the six levels of footnotes beneath it. Finally, a series of bolded, bracketed, numerical citations (e.g., '[10]'), located exclusively in the work's closing pages, reference entries in the attached \"APPENDIX\", making it possible for the reader to explore what might be treated as a third narrative thread, another level of discourse or, perhaps, merely an odd, subterranean commentary on the present work. 3.1 4 See, \"Brains in a vat\", in Putnam's Reason, Truth and History (1981). _______________ 1.1 The earliest assertion of such an isomorphism within the generally accepted boundaries of the Western tradition is found in Plato's Cratylus, written in the 4th century B.C.E., wherein Socrates, here serving as Plato's mouthpiece, states that \"a name is an imitation, just as a painting or portrait is.\" Much later, in his posthumously published Ethics (1677), Baruch de Spinoza maintained that \"[t]he order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.\" And, more recently, in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, first published in 1921, Ludwig Wittgenstein proclaimed that \"[a] proposition is a picture of reality. ¶ A proposition is a model of reality as we think it is.\" (Tractatus 4.01.) Although the first of Wittgenstein's above-quoted statements fails, at least as it is intended in the Tractatus, the second has yet to be seriously challenged. 2.1 Wittgenstein drafted the individual notes comprising On Certainty over the eighteen-month period immediately preceding his death, making the last such entry just two days prior to his passing on April 29, 1951. Accordingly, subsequent citations herein date the work to 1951. 3.1 A note toward deconstruction: the text proper can be read without reference to either the formalized fragments or the footnotes and should be the sole focus of a first reading, leaving incorporation of the footnotes in their various levels for a second, the formalized fragments for a third, and the bolded, bracketed cross-references to the Appendix for a fourth. ii any life but that of the vat. Thus, we not only seem to ourselves to be as we 'actually' are, we seem so to others as well. That is, the hallucination we are to suppose has been imposed upon us is that of the 'external' world; and now, of course, the question is whether we can ever be certain this supposition is not, in fact, so. 5 Putnam's answer is that we can be certain. He points out that if I am a brain-in-a-vat the proposition 'There is a tree in front of me' when uttered by me does not refer to an actual tree but to a tree \"in the image.\" That is to say, the statement is framed in \"vat-English\" and is true (in vat-English) if and only if I am presented with an image of a tree. The fact that there is no 'real' tree in front of me has no bearing on the truth-value of the _______________ 5 The present work outlines an epistemological framework coalesced out of the West's slowly evolving understandings of such concepts as the observer,5.1 the reality observed,5.2 and the symbol or sign, 5.3 and of the interwoven relations among these three. 5.4 Accordingly, the question of whether we are, in fact, brains-in-a-vat is, as treated herein, only secondarily a metaphysical question. _______________ 5.1 See, e.g., as to 'the observer', the historical arc beginning with the Cartesian Cogito, i.e., \"Cogito ergo sum\", or, \"I think, therefore I am\" (Rene Descartes, \"Discourse on Method\" [1637]), and continuing on to \"[the self is merely] a bundle or collection of different perceptions which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement\" (David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature [1739]), then to \"[t]he subject who knows cannot be known precisely as such, otherwise he would be known by another subject\" (Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Idea II [1844]), and, finally, to both \"I is another\" (Arthur Rimbaud, in correspondence [1871]) and \"[t]he I in solipsism shrinks to an extensionless point and there remains the reality co-ordinated with it\" (Tractatus 5.64 [1921]). 5.2 As to 'the reality observed': \"[I]n common talk, the objects of our senses are not termed ideas but rather things. Call them so still: provided you do not attribute to them any absolute external existence. . . . ¶ I am not for changing things into ideas, but rather ideas into things; since those immediate objects of perception, which according to you, are only appearances of things, I take to be the real things themselves\" (George Berkeley, Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous in Opposition to Sceptics and Atheists [1713]); \"Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries – not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer. . . . [I]n point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.\" (Willard Van Orman Quine, \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" [1951]). 5.3 As to 'the symbol or sign': \"The world is the totality of facts . . . ¶ We make to ourselves pictures of facts. . . . ¶ That the elements of the picture are combined with one another in a definite way, represents that the things are so combined with one another. . . . Thus the picture is linked with reality; it reaches up to it\" (the early Wittgenstein, in the Tractatus 1.1, 2.1, 2.15, and 2.1511 [1921]); \"The mistake we are liable to make could be expressed thus: We are looking for the use of a sign, but we look for it as though it were an object co-existing with the sign. . . . ¶ [But] [t]he sign (the sentence) gets its significance from the system of signs, from the language to which it belongs. . . . ¶ [O]ne is tempted to imagine that which gives the sentence life as something in an occult sphere, accompanying the sentence. But whatever accompanied it would for us just be another sign\" (the later Wittgenstein, in The Blue Book [1934]); \"It might be imagined that some propositions, of the form of empirical propositions, were hardened and functioned as channels for such empirical propositions as were not hardened but fluid; and that this relation altered with time, in that fluid propositions hardened, and hard ones became fluid\" (the last Wittgenstein, in On Certainty [1951]). 5.4 And, as to 'the interwoven relations among them': \"The limits of my language mean the limits of my world\" (Tractatus 5.6 [1921]); \"The fact of the matter is that the 'real world' is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group. No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality. The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same worlds with different labels attached\" (Benjamin Lee Whorf, \"Science and Linguistics\" [1940]); \"One often hears that successive [scientific] theories grow ever closer to, or approximate more and more closely to, the truth. Apparently, generalizations like that refer not to the puzzlesolutions and the concrete predictions derived from a theory but rather to its ontology, to the match, that is, between the entities with which the theory populates nature and what is 'really there.' . . . ¶ Perhaps there is some other way of salvaging the notion of 'truth' for application to whole theories, but this one will not do. There is, I think, no theory-independent way to reconstruct phrases like 'really there'; the notion of a match between the ontology of a theory and its 'real' counterpart in nature now seems to me illusive in principle\" (Thomas S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions [1962]). iii vat-English proposition. 6 By the same reasoning, Putnam concludes that in vat-English the term 'vat' refers not to external world vats but to vats in-the-image. Consequently, the thought experiment's foundational supposition, my statement that I am a brain-in-a-vat, is (if true) framed not in English but in vat-English; and, according to Putnam's analysis, the truth-conditions of this vat-English proposition could be satisfied only if it were to appear to me (from the perspective of the vat) that I am a brain-in-a-vat. However, it does not appear to me that I am a brain-in-a-vat. 7 Rather, it appears that I possess a physical body, whole and complete, with a full array of sensory _______________ 6 \"[W]hen the brain in a vat (in the world where every sentient being is and always was a brain in a vat) thinks 'There is a tree in front of me', his thought does not refer to actual trees. On some theories that we shall discuss it might refer to trees in the image, or to the electronic impulses that cause tree experiences, or to the features of the program that are responsible for those electronic impulses. These theories are not ruled out by what was just said, for there is a close causal connection between the use of the word 'tree' in vat-English and the presence of trees in the image, the presence of electronic impulses of a certain kind, and the presence of certain features in the machine's program. On these theories the brain is right, not wrong in thinking 'There is a tree in front of me.' Given what 'tree' refers to in vat-English and what 'in front of' refers to, assuming one of these theories is correct, then the truth-conditions for 'There is a tree in front of me' when it occurs in vat-English are simply that a tree in the image be 'in front of' the 'me' in question – in the image – or, perhaps, that the kind of electronic impulse that normally produces this experience be coming from the automatic machinery, or, perhaps, that the feature of the machinery that is supposed to produce the 'tree in front of one' experience be operating. And these truth-conditions are certainly fulfilled.\" (Reason, Truth and History.) 7 \"By the same argument, 'vat' refers to vats in the image in vat-English, or something related (electronic impulses or program features), but certainly not to real vats, since the use of 'vat' in vat-English has no causal connection to real vats (apart from the connection that the brains in a vat wouldn't be able to use the word 'vat', if it were not for the presence of one particular vat – the vat they are in; but this connection obtains between the use of every word in vat-English and that one particular vat; it is not a special connection between the use of the particular word 'vat' and vats). Similarly, 'nutrient fluid' refers to a liquid in the image in vat-English, or something related (electronic impulses or program features). It follows that if their 'possible world' is really the actual one, and we are really the brains in a vat, then what we now mean by 'we are brains in a vat' is that we are brains in a vat in the image or something of that kind (if we mean anything at all).\" (Reason, Truth and History.) iv contacts with the external world. Putnam, thus, concludes that the supposition that we are brains in a vat is not only false, it is necessarily so. 8 Putnam's argument rests on the claim that – in order for 'vat' to refer to the vat in which I am attempting to suppose that I reside – the supposition itself would have to be false, since (according to Putnam) the term could so refer only if I were not residing in such a vat. This claim, however, rests on a 'causal' theory of reference, which theories are problematically reliant on a de facto endorsement of logical positivism's (in)famous _______________ 8 \"[W]e aren't brains in a vat in the image (i.e. what we are 'hallucinating' isn't that we are brains in a vat). So, if we are brains in a vat, then the sentence 'We are brains in a vat' says something false (if it says anything). In short, if we are brains in a vat, then 'We are brains in a vat' is false. So, it is (necessarily) false.\" 8.1 (Reason, Truth and History.) _______________ 8.1A statement may be asserted to be necessarily false on a variety of grounds. According to Putnam, the supposition that we are brains-in-a-vat is necessarily false because it is, in a specific way, self-refuting: \"A 'self-refuting supposition' is one whose truth implies its own falsity. For example, consider the thesis that all general statements are false. This is a general statement. So if it is true, then it must be false. Hence, it is false. Sometimes a thesis is called 'self-refuting' if it is the supposition that the thesis is entertained or enunciated that implies its falsity. For example, 'I do not exist' is self-refuting if thought by me (for any 'me'). So one can be certain that one oneself exists, if one thinks about it (as Descartes argued). ¶ What I shall show is that the supposition that we are brains in a vat has just this property. If we can consider whether it is true or false, then it is not true (I shall show). Hence it is not true.\" 8.11 (Reason, Truth and History.) _______________ 8.11 Setting aside the question of whether Putnam's analyses are correct even within the limitations of his stated framework, alternative frameworks are available. Thus, for example, on the p system analysis discussed below, even the general statement 'all general statements are false' would not, in at least certain instances of its use, be considered to be necessarily false. Rather, it would be treated as a metan-p statement uttered with reference to general statements contained within one or more lower-order systems, i.e., within metan-1-p systems and below. 8.111 (See further, footnote 24, below.) _______________ 8.111 This preclusion of self-reference also means that the liar paradox and its structural analogs cannot be coherently posed within the version of the p system framework employed herein. 8.1111 This is not to say that the present text includes a solution to the liar paradox. It does not. But not every paradox need be treated on each occasion of its acquaintance as a puzzle to be solved, and not every paradox impacts equally each and every philosophical explanation in which it might be encountered. _______________ 8.1111 Thus, consider the statements 'The following statement is true' and 'The preceding statement is false'. Let us call the first of these 'x1' and the second 'x2'. Within the p system framework employed herein, x1 may be true only if it is a member of a p system 'higher' than that p system of which x2 is a member. In that event, however, x2 does not and cannot refer to x1 at all, since the p system framework employed herein does not permit propositions of a given p system to refer to propositions which are members of a higher-order p system. That is, if x1 successfully refers to x2, then x2 does not and cannot successfully refer to x1. Moreover, an analogous breakdown occurs if, as with one's first encounter with an M.C. Escher print, one begins one's analysis from the other end, starting with x2 rather than x1. v verifiability principle, 9 which in its strongest forms, at least, may be taken as holding that only empirically verifiable _______________ 9 \"The supposition that such a possibility [i.e., that we are, in fact, brains in a vat] makes sense arises from a combination of two errors: (1) taking physical possibility too seriously; and (2) unconsciously operating with a magical theory of reference, a theory on which certain mental representations necessarily refer to certain external things and kinds of things. 9.1 ¶ There is a 'physically possible world' in which we are brains in a vat – what does this mean except that there is a description of such a state of affairs which is compatible with the laws of physics? Just as there is a tendency in our culture (and has been since the seventeenth century) to take physics as our metaphysics, that is, to view the exact sciences as the long-sought description of the 'true and ultimate furniture of the universe', so there is, as an immediate consequence, a tendency to take 'physical possibility' as the very touchstone of what might really actually be the case. Truth is physical truth; possibility physical possibility; and necessity physical necessity, on such a view. But we have just seen, if only in the case of a very contrived example so far, that this view is wrong. 9.2 The existence of a 'physically possible world' in which we are brains in a vat (and always were and will be) does not mean that we might really, actually, possibly be brains in a vat. What rules out this possibility is not physics but philosophy. ¶ Some philosophers, eager both to assert and minimize the claims of their profession at the same time (the typical mind of Anglo-American philosophy in the twentieth century), would say: 'Sure. You have shown that some things that seem to be physical possibilities are really conceptual impossibilities. What's so surprising about that?' ¶ Well, to be sure, my argument can be described as a 'conceptual' one. But to describe philosophical activity as the search for 'conceptual' truths makes it all sound like inquiry about the meaning of words. And that is not at all what we have been engaging in. ¶ What we have been doing is considering the preconditions for thinking about, representing, referring to, etc. We have investigated these preconditions not by investigating the meaning of these words and phrases (as a linguist might, for example) but by reasoning a priori. Not in the old 'absolute' sense (since we don't claim that magical theories of reference are a priori wrong), but in the sense of inquiring into what is reasonably possible assuming certain general premisses, or making certain very broad theoretical assumptions. 9.3 Such a procedure is neither 'empirical' nor quite 'a priori', but has elements of both ways of investigating. In spite of the fallibility of my procedure, and its dependence upon assumptions which might be described as 'empirical' (e.g. the assumption that the mind has no access to external things or properties apart from that provided by the senses), my procedure has a close relation to what Kant called a 'transcendental' investigation; for it is an investigation, I repeat, of the preconditions of reference and hence of thought[.]\" 9.4 (Reason, Truth and History.) _______________ 9.1 To be clear, it is not the element of necessity in the so-called magical theories of reference that Putnam finds most problematic but, rather, the absence of the element of causality: \"One of the premisses of the argument is obvious: that magical theories of reference are wrong, wrong for mental representations and not only for physical ones. The other premiss is that one cannot refer to certain kinds of things, e.g. trees, if one has no causal interaction with them, or with things in terms of which they can be described.\" (Reason, Truth and History.) However, Putnam's injunction against taking physical possibility 'too seriously' is misleading, in that it seems to incline him to believe that by de-emphasizing physical possibility while simultaneously decrying magical theories of reference he can somehow thread the unthreadable needle. But what is 'causal' supposed to mean in this setting, if not something which would imply some version or another of the verifiability principle? 9.2 It is wrong, though Putnam has not demonstrated it to be so via his brains-in-a-vat thought experiment. He is completely correct, however, in his insistence that philosophy is more than science's wretched stepsister. 9.3 Putnam's announcement that what he is seeking to establish is merely that it is not 'reasonably possible' we might be brains in a vat is in some ways akin to Descartes' attempt, in the wake of the Cogito, to reconstruct the external world on the shaky foundation of the statement 'God is no deceiver'. In neither instance does the 'explanation' further its stated purpose. In the case of the Cogito, one cannot (at that stage of the analysis, at least) shore up a dubitable assertion by simply inserting beneath it an even more dubitable assertion. In either instance, one may justifiably feel the philosopher has somehow missed the full implications of his own argument. With Descartes, the matter can be resolved by simply ignoring the flimsy, after-the-fact, reconstructive argument (which some consider nothing more than political camouflage, anyway). 9.31 The situation with Putnam, however, is more complex. (See, footnote 32.3, below.) 9.4 Again, Putnam's arguments and conclusions as to such 'preconditions' are inextricably bound up with his 'causal' theory of reference, which itself cannot be explicated in a way so as not to import into his argument one or another version of positivism's verifiability principle. _______________ 9.31 The greatest significance of the Cogito lies in its conclusive demonstration of the fact that the power of our critical tools so far outstrips that of every other tool at our disposal as to necessitate, for any who would not be forced into an absolute scepticism, the adoption of one or more fundamental propositions (each of which must originate in a vision, intuition, or understanding, a leap of faith, or an arbitrary assignment), on the basis of which we must all, philosophers and non-philosophers alike, construct our worlds. Whether any given instance of such adoption is properly treated as philosophically legitimate depends on the use to which the adopted proposition is put, i.e., on the role it plays in a person's life. vi statements are cognitively meaningful. 10 _______________ 10 Beginning in the late 1920s, and arguing largely on the basis of Wittgenstein's Tractatus, the logical positivists maintained that appropriately strict applications of the verifiability principle demonstrate the impossibility of metaphysics and that empirical science is, accordingly, the only method by which we can gain knowledge of the world. However, it was subsequently determined that strict application of the principle as effectively demonstrates the meaninglessness of various propositions essential to the establishment of empirical science as it does those of metaphysics. 10.1 Thus, the later history of positivism became the story of a series of retreats and failed retrenchments behind successively weaker versions of the principle. 10.2 The fall of positivism completed the principle's slide into disrepute; and, it is now considered by many to be invalid in all its forms. In point of problematic fact, the verifiability principle remains one of critical philosophy's most indispensable tools. 10.3 _______________ 10.1 The following comment regarding the verifiability principle, from A.J. Ayer's Language, Truth & Logic (1935), is indicative of both the positivists' aims and the problems they encountered in implementing them: \"[I]f we accept conclusive verifiability as our criterion of significance, as some positivists have proposed, our argument will prove too much. Consider, for example, the case of general propositions of law – such propositions, namely, as 'arsenic is poisonous'; 'all men are mortal'; 'a body tends to expand when it is heated.' It is of the very nature of these propositions that their truth cannot be established with certainty by any finite series of observations.\" 10.11 10.2 By the late 1940s, logical positivism had largely run its course, with every attempt to salvage any version of either a verifiability or a falsifiability principle sufficiently strong to further positivism's goals having seemingly failed. Accordingly, in a short paper published in 1950, Carl Hempel sought to chart a new way forward for the empiricist movement more broadly, locating the failure of positivism in its reliance on natural language as the starting point for its analysis: \"[A]s long as we try to set up a criterion of testability for individual sentences in a natural language, in terms of logical relationship to observation sentences, the result will be either too restrictive or too inclusive, or both. . . . ¶ The predicament would not arise, of course, in an artificial language whose vocabulary and grammar were so chosen as to preclude altogether the possibility of forming sentences of any kind which the empiricist meaning criterion is intended to rule out. Let us call any such language an empiricist language. . . . ¶ Now theories of the advanced type here referred to may be considered as hypothetico-deductive systems in which all statements are logical consequences of a set of fundamental assumptions. Fundamental as well as derived statements in such a system are formulated either in terms of certain theoretical constructs which are not defined within the system and thus play the role of primitives, or in terms of expressions defined by means of the latter. Thus, in their logical structure such systems equal the axiomatized uninterpreted systems studied in mathematics and logic. They acquire applicability to empirical subject matter, and thus the status of theories of empirical science, by virtue of an empirical interpretation[,] [with the result that] . . . ¶ a sentence [is properly considered to be] cognitively meaningful if its non-logical constituents refer, directly or in certain specified indirect ways, to observables.\" (\"Problems and Changes in the Empiricist Criterion of Meaning\" [1950].) ¶ Hempel's analysis not only marked the historical endpoint of positivism; it also set a minimum standard for future empiricist theories, establishing that any such theory, in order to be considered successful, would have to adequately explicate the supposed relation between the 'non-logical constituents' of certain 'sentences' in an 'axiomatized propositional system' and the 'observables' to which either (i) those non-logical constituents, (ii) the sentences in which they occur, or (iii) the propositional system in its entirety is supposed to 'refer'. 10.3 Unfortunately, because use of the principle today is frequently unacknowledged by both writers and critics alike, the question of whether any given instance of its application will be accepted by any significant portion of the philosophical community now depends almost entirely on sociological factors surrounding the specific circumstances of its use. _______________ 10.11 This characteristic of universal generalizations led Karl Popper, the 20th century's pre-eminent philosopher of science, to place falsifiability rather than verifiability at the center of his deeply influential mid-century philosophical analyses of the practice of science. However, because existential generalizations – e.g., 'There is at least one red swan' – are no more capable of being falsified than universal generalizations are of being verified, every attempt to substitute falsifiability for verifiability in the positivist analysis failed. 10.111 _______________ 10.111 What is fatal in one context, however, is not necessarily so in another, even where the principle at issue is or appears to be the same. Thus, well after the collapse of logical positivism, Popper addressed both the critical role played by falsifiability in the practice of science and the continuing role played by the falsifiability principle in his philosophy of science by noting that there is an asymmetry between existential and universal generalizations, such that the latter \"are never derivable from singular statements, but can be contradicted by singular statements.\" (The Logic of Scientific Discovery [1959].) vii That Putnam's analysis is both misleading and mistaken can be demonstrated as follows: Consider the vat dweller's utterance of Putnam's vat-English proposition 11 'There is a tree in front of me.' In that situation in which the speaker is presented with the image of a tree, his utterance of the proposition is true whenever he is engaged, merely and accurately, in reporting this sense impression. That is, his utterance is true on precisely those occasions on which he intends to refer only to the presented-image. The reverse is the case with regard to the speaker's utterance of the vat-English proposition 'I am a brain-in-a-vat.' Uttered with the intention of referring only to the presented-image, this latter proposition is, as pointed out by Putnam himself, simply false. A more philosophically significant utterance of the latter proposition, however, is that in which the speaker hypothesizes a frame of reference exceeding any perspective 12 available from the vat. 13 For instance, the speaker may state that he is a brain-in-a-vat with the intention of claiming that Putnam's evil scientist has, indeed, removed his brain and is engaged in imposing various hallucinations upon him. Let us further suppose that this is, in fact, the case. The speaker's utterance, though true, 14 cannot be determined to be so by anyone lacking access to the requisite bird's-eye view 15; and, because neither the speaker himself nor any other member of his linguistic community has such access, the truth-value of the utterance might 'properly' be treated by them a undetermined, though only contingently so. 16 Nevertheless, and contrary to _______________ 11 Unless specifically noted otherwise, and to the greatest extent possible, the terms 'proposition', 'statement', 'sentence', and their near synonyms are intended to function interchangeably throughout the text proper and each of its various levels of footnotes, including the formalized fragments. 12 For informal definitions of both these italicized terms, see footnote 44, below. 13 Let us define a 'p system' as a 'propositional system containing one or more fundamental propositions' 13.1 and a 'metan+1-p system' 13.2 as 'any p system which includes within itself one or more propositions referring to a metan-p system, whether such reference be global or to an individual proposition (or set of propositions) within such system.' This definition of metan+1-p systems is specifically intended to include systems standing in a comprehensive, umbrella-like embrace of another p system, metan-p, such that a given speaker, properly considered to be a fluent speaker, need not (for the purposes of everyday speech) be cognizant of which of his or her utterances are members of metan-p and which are members of one or another higher-order p system. 14 Putnam himself, however, being committed to the claim that the term 'vat' in vat-English can only be used to refer to vats in-the-image, denies that the speaker's utterance would, under these conditions, be true. Thus, Putnam's denial constitutes an endorsement of one of the stronger versions of the verifiability principle, specifically one on which any utterance not immediately verifiable by the utterance's speaker, or, at least, by some actual member of the speaker's linguistic community, expresses a metaphysical proposition and is, as such, meaningless. 14.1 15 That is, lacking access to a perspective from which the utterance's truth-value could be determined. 16 Since the evil scientist could at any moment restore the speaker to his body, thereby giving him access to the previously unavailable bird's-eye view and allowing him to state, at that later point in time, that his earlier assertion of the proposition, 'I am a brain-in-a-vat', had been, at the time of its utterance, true. _______________ 13.1 The concept of a fundamental proposition, like that of referring to, is largely explicated herein through the contexts of its usage; one might note, however, that the concept is similar (though not identical) to that of a 'primitive proposition' as that term is used by Hempel (see, footnote 10.2, above), and that the statement 'I am a brain-in-a-vat' is, under some-but-not-all conditions of its utterance, a fundamental proposition. 13.2 All p systems designated 'meta0-p' are specifically excluded from this definition, in that no proposition within any such system may refer to any other p system, whether in whole or in part. (See further, footnote 19, below.) 14.1It should be noted that such instantiations of the principle are (arguably) themselves metaphysical propositions and, therefore, (arguably) subject to their own, reflexive, sanction. (Cf., footnotes 34 and 34.1, below.) viii Putnam, so long as a possible bird's-eye view exists, the statement itself, it would seem, must be either true or false. 17 That is, so long as there exists a logically possible perspective from which the proposition's truthvalue could be determined, the merely contingent fact of such a perspective's inaccessibility to a given speaker is irrelevant to the metaphysical fact of the proposition's truth-value. 18 Although the possible truth of the vat-speaker's utterance is, of course, logically inconsistent with Putnam's conclusion, simply pointing this out is not in itself sufficient to refute his position. We must address the essential point of Putnam's thought experiment. Were the speaker above to gain access to the appropriate bird's-eye view, he would find the issue of whether he is ultimately a brain-in-a-vat to be in no way settled, for the supposition that he is such a brain could be immediately reformulated and stated again. Although access to a previously unavailable bird's-eye view perspective would give such a speaker a privileged position relative to his former abode (that is, the vat), making available to him a frame of reference within which determination of the truth-value of his original utterance of the supposition would be possible, 19 his ability to determine the truth-value of the newly re-uttered supposition would be in no way enhanced. 20 Thus, our discussion above concerning the truth-conditions of bird's-eye view utterances would appear to miss the mark. What we want to know, and what Putnam denies is possible, is whether we might really be brains-in-a-vat. That is, our interest is in those propositions whose frames of reference go beyond the provisional frameworks discussed above, to an ultimate metaphysical reality. Consider again the vat-English proposition 'There is a tree in front of me,' in this instance uttered with metaphysical emphasis. The proposition no longer claims only that there is a tree in front of me in-theimage, or even that there is a tree in front of me in that sensible world which is external to the evil scientist's vat. Rather, it may be taken to be a far more ambitious statement, a response to the fundamental Cartesian query, that is, as a statement asserting that there is a tree in front of me in some metaphysically ultimate reality. Similarly, when so emphasized, the vat-English proposition 'I am a brain-in-a-vat' makes an assertion concerning my own ultimate metaphysical status, claiming that I am really a brain-in-a-vat. _______________ 17 Let us define a 'quasi-fundamental proposition' 17.1 as 'a proposition, the truth-value of which cannot be determined within the limitations imposed by the perspective(s) available to a given speaker or set of speakers (though such truth-value may well be arbitrarily assigned) but could be determined from some contingently unavailable meta-perspective.' 17.2 18 It should be noted, however, that this claim rests on a pair of well-established logical conventions only qualifiedly endorsed herein – the first being that any sentence expressing a meaningful empirical statement must necessarily be either true or false, the second being that ontology is independent of epistemology. The discussion below will ultimately restrict the valid scope of both these principles. 19 Let us consider meta0-p to be our object language, a system which (i) (by previous definition) includes within itself no proposition(s) referring to meta0-p globally or to any of the individual propositions of which meta0-p is comprised, and (ii) neither includes nor embraces any proposition(s) referring to any other propositional system globally or to any proposition(s) contained in any other propositional system. 20 Again, suppose the evil scientist has returned him to his body. He may still be inclined to wonder if the vat he now looks down upon is real or merely another hallucination imposed upon him by the same (or still greater) scientist. _______________ 17.1 The class of quasi-fundamental propositions and the class of fundamental propositions are discrete classes. 17.2 The present text, with its self-swallowing conventions and logically indeterminate propositions, may fairly be considered to owe something to Kurt Gödel's first and second incompleteness theorems, 17.21 which are frequently taken to establish that: (i) for any consistent formal system of sufficient power and scope, there must be at least one sentence that is formally undecidable (i.e., neither provable nor refutable) within such system, and (ii) the consistency of any such formal system cannot be proved within the system itself. Any such debt, however, is spiritual only, in that the concepts of logical indeterminateness and undecidability are distinct. _______________ 17.21 In \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I\" (1931). ix Notice, however, that determination of the truth (or falsity) of such a proposition would require access not merely to a bird's-eye perspective but to a God's-eye perspective; 21 and that, should any such God's-eye perspective exist, it must necessarily stand in a relation either congruent with some correspondingly ultimate propositional system or supra-linguistic to any and all possible systems. Yet, neither disjunct is realizable: the ultimate propositional system of the first 22 is a straightforward logical impossibility, since to every possible propositional system [metan-p] there stands a possible metapropositional system [metan+1-p]; and, since truth-value, though a metaphysical property, is a property which can only be determined within the context of propositional systems, satisfaction of the second disjunct would, by locating the God's-eye view in a linguistically inaccessible plane, render also any such perspective necessarily inaccessible to the process of determining propositional truth-value. 23 Thus, the truth-value of this, and every other, metaphysically emphasized utterance is logically indeterminate. 24 _______________ 21 That is, to a perspective co-extensive with that metaphysically ultimate reality referenced above, of which co-extensiveness, it should be noted, the speaker is also somehow aware. 22 Such a system would, presumably, be identical to the 'ideal' language long sought by such spiritual successors to the logical positivists as Carl Hempel, whose discussion of a 'hypothetico-deductive', 'artificial' language in footnote 10.2, above, serves to illustrate both the post-positivist quest and the philosophical agenda which drove it. 23 Regardless of whether one is inclined to seek one's metaphysical beginnings 'in heaven or on earth', 23.1 Wittgenstein's private language argument delineates the limits of that quest. 23.2 24 Suppose now a series of hypotheses, a series of H-type propositions, each of which states that the truth-value of any fundamental proposition is logically indeterminate. Let us now explicitly state that a proposition cannot be a member of any p system to which that proposition refers. 24.1 Thus, being about metan-1-p systems, where 'n' represents that system of which a given H-type proposition is a member, H-type propositions are possible members of only meta1-p systems and higher. That is, H is a possible member of meta1-p systems, H  is a possible member of meta2-p systems, H   is a possible member of meta3-p systems, and so on. _______________ 23.1 That is, whether in the supraor ante-linguistic. 23.2 \"Let us imagine the following case. I want to keep a diary about the recurrence of a certain sensation. To this end I associate it with the sign 'S' and write this sign in a calendar for every day on which I have the sensation. – I will remark first of all that a definition of the sign cannot be formulated. – But still I can give myself a kind of ostensive definition. – How? Can I point to the sensation? Not in the ordinary sense. But I speak, or write the sign down, and at the same time I concentrate my attention on the sensation – and so, as it were, point to it inwardly. – But what is this ceremony for? For that is all it seems to be! A definition surely serves to establish the meaning of a sign. – Well, that is done precisely by the concentrating of my attention; for in this way I impress on myself the connexion between the sign and the sensation. – But 'I impress it on myself' can only mean: this process brings it about that I remember the connexion right in the future. But in the present case I have no criterion of correctness. One would like to say: whatever is going to seem right to me is right. And that only means that here we can't talk about 'right'.\" (Wittgenstein, Philosophical Investigations.) 24.1 From this it follows that the p system model employed herein does not permit self-referential propositions. 24.11 Instances of apparent self-reference are treated the same as are H-type propositions above. For example, consider the sentence 'This sentence contains five words.' Pursuant to the version of the p system model here employed, the sample sentence – let us call it 'proposition G' and designate it a member of system metan-p – would refer not to itself but to a G-type proposition in another, lower-order p system, metan-1-p. 24.12 (See, further, 8.11 et seq., above.) _______________ 24.11 The p system model's handling of seemingly self-referential statements is somewhat similar to that of Alfred North Whitehead's and Bertrand Russell's theory of types, which asserts that because a class is of a different logical type than its members and because logical types must not be confused or intertwined, no class can be a member of itself. 24.111 However, there are significant differences between the problems the theory of types was intended to solve and the circumstances the p system model is here employed to illustrate. 24.12 This preclusion of self-reference is, of course, contrary to the accepted conventions of natural language; and, accordingly, one might well prefer an attempt at incorporating self-reference into an alternative version of the p system model. However, such alternative analyses, when conducted competently and in good faith, do not arrive at materially different conclusions from those arrived at herein; they merely arrive there via different paths. 24.121 _______________ 24.111 In Principia Mathematica (1910). 24.121 The treaded ground is not new. Numerous reasons (beyond those discussed herein) have been given historically for denying the possibility of genuine self-reference, many of which have little on their surface to do with propositional self-reference at all. One of the more resonant of these is Schopenhauer's assertion regarding self-knowledge, that \"[t]he subject who knows cannot be known precisely as such, otherwise he would be known by another subject.\" (The World as Will and Idea II.) x The possible truth-value assignments for the vat-English proposition 'I am a brain-in-a-vat' can now be summarized as follows: A given utterance of the proposition is (i) false, where its frame of reference is limited to the presented-image; (ii) either true or false, though which is not verifiable by the speaker, where its frame of reference exceeds the presented-image but stops short of metaphysical emphasis; and, (iii) logically indeterminate, where such metaphysical emphasis is given. That is, if we consider vat-English to be a metan-p system and assume the statement to be uttered without metaphysical emphasis (as in (i), above), then the statement is plainly false, and could be known by the speaker to be otherwise, only if he somehow appeared to himself to be a brain-in-a-vat. If, on the other hand, we assume the statement to be uttered with reference to a bird's-eye view perspective contingently unavailable to the speaker 25 (for example, the perspective of Putnam's evil scientist) (as in (ii), above), the truth-value of the statement is either true or false, but which of those two values is unknown to the speaker. Thus, any version of the statement 'I am a brain-in-a-vat' uttered with reference to a bird's-eye view perspective of the sort posited by Putnam is neither plainly false nor logically indeterminate, in that the truth-value of any such utterance might possibly be discovered to be true (if, for instance, the evil scientist later placed the speaker back in his 'real' body). 26 Finally, if we assume the statement to be uttered with metaphysical emphasis (as in (iii), above), it is a fundamental proposition, the truth-value of which could be ascertained only from within the logically impossible, ultimate propositional system, metax-p. 27 Returning to Putnam and his thought experiment, then, the fact that we presumably refer to 'real' trees and vats when we describe our phenomenal world, while the vat speaker is able to refer only to trees and vats in-theimage, is ultimately not significant. Although this fact, if true, implies that we have access to a bird's-eye view (that is, a perspective) unavailable to the vat speaker, it does not imply that we successfully refer to anything in the metaphysical sense. Nor could such reference be analytically validated if it did occur. Putnam's failure to fully grasp the implications of these two points constitutes the essential mistake in his analysis. Putnam maintains that the entry-and-exit rules 28 by which we relate language to the world allow us to refer to real trees (unless we are, in fact, brains-in-a-vat, in which case they allow us to refer to trees in-the-image). What these rules do not allow us to do, according to Putnam, is refer to extra-linguistic objects existing beyond reach of the rules. For instance, because the vat dweller cannot \"point\" to the vat in which he dwells, he is unable to refer to that vat. His metaphysically speculative utterance 'I am a brain-in-a-vat' is, therefore, false (or meaningless) in the only language available to him. As noted in footnotes 9 and 9.1, above, for Putnam the vat dweller's belief that his utterance is intelligible is the result of two fundamental errors: (1) The acceptance of one _______________ 25 That is, from a perspective associated with a p system of higher-order than metan-p but of lesser-order than the logically impossible, ultimate p system, metax-p, referenced in the immediately following sentence of the primary text. 26 Let us now consider H', a possible member of meta2-p systems. Because H' is itself a member of meta2-p, it cannot refer to the propositions of meta2-p. The referential scope of H' is limited to those fundamental propositions which are members of the meta1-p or meta0-p systems embraced by the meta2-p system(s) of which H' is a member. Thus, in order to demonstrate the lack of a logically determinate truth-value for a given fundamental proposition which is a member of meta2-p, it would seemingly be necessary to demonstrate the truth of H'', the H-type proposition which is a possible member of meta3-p systems. 26.1 27 Or, to put it another way, from within the ideal language associated with the linguistically inaccessible God's-eye view perspective discussed in footnotes 21-24, above, and their related sections of text and footnotes. 28 The most widely accepted examples of such rules center around the ostensive definitions by means of which we learn our native languages as children, and on which we continue to rely as adults to relate word to object. This much is seemingly fact. And yet, the roles played by such definitions in the acquisition and use of language are both mysterious and deeply problematic. See, e.g., footnote 23.2, above. _______________ 26.1 While any given H-type proposition is properly classified as a quasi-fundamental proposition, the set of H-type propositions, taken as a whole, may be understood to imply a fundamental assertion. Where the speaker's utterance of an H-type proposition is with metaphysical emphasis, the speaker may be taken to intend to assert that each fundamental proposition in every possible p system lacks a logically determinate truth-value, the truth-value of which assertion is, of course, itself logically indeterminate. xi or another 'magical' theory of reference 29 and (2) the belief that the possibility of 'causal interaction' is unrelated to the preconditions of reference. 30 _______________ 29 \"Some primitive people believe that some representations (in particular, names) have a necessary connection with their bearers; that to know the 'true name' of someone or something gives one power over it. This power comes from the magical connection between the name and the bearer of the name[.]\" 29.1 (Reason, Truth and History.) 30 In fact, Putnam goes further, suggesting it is not possible but actual causal interaction that is a necessary precondition of reference, that is, the word, 'x', must actually (in some, unspecified way) causally interact with the extra-linguistic object, x. 30.1 _______________ 29.1 The first modern theory of reference was put forward in the last decade of the 19th century, when Gottlob Frege drew a distinction between an expression's sense (i.e., connotation) and its reference (i.e., denotation), asserting that a sentence may be meaningful even where one or more of its component expressions lacks a referent, so long as we are able to grasp the sense of the denotatively empty expression: \"It can perhaps be granted that an expression has a sense if it is formed in a grammatically correct manner and stands for a proper name. But as to whether there is a denotation corresponding to the connotation is hereby not decided.\" (\"Sense and Reference\" [1892].) A Fregean analysis would, thus, attribute the intelligibility of such false existential statements as \"The largest prime number is even\" to our ability to grasp the sense of the expression 'the largest prime number' despite the fact that the expression has no referent. However, the Fregean analysis of such sentences was considered inadequate by some; and, in 1905's \"On Denoting\", Bertrand Russell took up the matter again, using the sentence \"The present King of France is bald\" as his working model. According to Russell, this sentence conjunctively asserts three distinct things: (i) that there is an x such that x is presently the King of France; (ii) that, for any x and y, if x is currently King of France and y is currently King of France, then x = y; and (iii) that, for every x that is currently King of France, x is bald. On Russell's analysis, the entire statement is false, because the first conjunct is false. 29.11 ¶ The theory of descriptions introduced in \"On Denoting\" marks a significant step in the development of propositional logic and, as importantly, of logical atomism, the metaphysical and methodological model suggested (if not logically implied) by Russell's and Whitehead's propositional logic. Logical atomism posited a 'mapping' or 'mirroring' relation between language and world, as in the 'picture theory' of Wittgenstein's Tractatus, referenced in footnote 1.1, above. 29.12 However, in the years immediately following atomism's development, neither Russell nor Wittgenstein sought to demonstrate the existence of the supposed 'picturing' relation between word or symbol, 'x', and the extralinguistic object, x. In fact, it is Wittgenstein's much later acknowledgment (in the Philosophical Investigations) of the impossibility of such demonstration which stands as the clearest line of demarcation between his early and later work. 29.13 30.1 Setting aside for the moment the question of whether a coherent and non-circular explication of the concept of causal interaction in the context of a theory of reference is even possible, while simultaneously acknowledging that Putnam's focus is on empirical statements, it is still at this point worth noting that, with regard to certain specific propositional types, 30.11 one may well demonstrate the truth-value of an entire class of propositions, some members of which correspond to unavailable frames of reference (such unavailability presumably precluding any 'causal interaction' whatsoever, regardless of the term's explication), from the values of those particular members of the series whose truth-values are fully determinable from within the available frames of reference. _______________ 29.11 Russell's three-part conjunctive statement can be represented in a variant of the propositional logic he himself played a significant role in developing as 'x{[Kx & y(Ky → y = x)] & Bx}'. Although Russell tends to receive the lion's share of the credit for the development of modern symbolic logic, he did not accomplish the task alone. Alfred North Whitehead, co-author with Russell of Principia Mathematica, the first comprehensive work on the subject of symbolic logic, was a full and equal partner in the work. 29.111 Moreover, many of Russell's and Whitehead's conclusions were significantly dependent on the work of others, most notably for present purposes the mathematician David Hilbert. ¶ Over the course of the two decades preceding publication of Principia Mathematica, Hilbert had made a series of breakthroughs relating to axiomatic mathematical systems, including the identification of such now familiar elements of propositional systems as the well-formed formulae or grammatical correctness requirement (i.e., the concept of propositional syntax), the requirement that a proposition functioning as an axiom in a given propositional system not be derivable from other propositions which are members of the system (i.e., the concept of independence), and the internal consistency requirement, meaning that it must not be possible to derive a contradiction from a system's axioms. 29.112 29.12 Russell first discussed the principles of logical atomism in a 1911 paper published only in French titled \"Le Réalisme analytique\"; but the ideas therein were not made readily available to the English-speaking public until 1918, when Russell delivered a series of lectures titled \"The Philosophy of Logical Atomism\", which lectures were then published in England later that same year. This later version of logical atomism, however, was significantly influenced by the thinking of Russell's former student, Wittgenstein, whose working notes for the Tractatus go back to at least 1914. 29.121 29.13 See, e.g., footnote 23.2, above, and footnote 31.1, below. 30.11 See, e.g., footnote 26.1, above, regarding H-type propositions. _______________ 29.111 Whitehead, the older of the two by more than a decade, came first to the subject, publishing his A Treatise on Universal Algebra in 1898, with the younger Russell not publishing his own The Principles of Mathematics until five years later. Shortly thereafter, the two men began collaborating on what would become the massively ambitious Principia Mathematica, the first volume of which was published in 1910. 29.112 Russell and Whitehead incorporated each of these rules into the propositional logic of Principia Mathematica, wherein they claimed to have reduced mathematics to logic. This claim was soon determined to be mistaken. However, the system of propositional logic they developed continues, with very minor changes, to be commonly employed today. 29.121 See, Wittgenstein, Notebooks, 1914-1916. xii It is Putnam, however, not the vat dweller, who is mistaken. Putnam fails to realize that it is not only so-called 'magical' theories of reference which are precluded; Wittgenstein's private language and beetle-in-a-box arguments demonstrate that all theories of extra-linguistic reference, including Putnam's own 'causal interaction' theory, are equally 'magical'. 31 Thus, unless we are willing to assume the existence of an unverifiable relation between word and object, we cannot even endorse the first step in Putnam's analysis – i.e., the claim that we refer to real trees, or even that vat speakers refer to trees in-the-image. 32 _______________ 31 That is, the causal interactions which Putnam would permit, on which his theory relies, and to which his entry-and-exit rules would apply, are as inherently speculative as any other alleged relation between word and extra-linguistic object. 31.1 32 Putnam, like the later Wittgenstein (though to somewhat different purpose), maintains that it is language use, not the private or inner experience, which constitutes understanding, that to understand a sentence means to be master of a technique. 32.1 However, as Quine's principle of the indeterminacy of translation 32.2 suggests, another's use of a word is ultimately no more accessible to us than is his or her inner meaning or experience. 32.3 Moreover, the principle applies not only to 'translations' of the sort Quine discusses but to every possible entry-and-exit rule, not even excluding those ostensive definitions which have, we must yet believe, enabled each of us to learn his or her native language. 32.4 _______________ 31.1 See, again, the private language argument, footnote 23.2, above; see also, the beetle-in-a-box argument: \"Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a 'beetle.' No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle. – Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing. – But suppose the word 'beetle' had a place in these people's language? – If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty.\" (Philosophical Investigations.) 32.1 \"[N]o matter what sort of inner phenomena we allow as possible expressions of thought, arguments exactly similar to the foregoing will show that it is not the phenomena themselves that constitute understanding, but rather the ability of the thinker to employ these phenomena, to produce the right phenomena in the right circumstances. ¶ The foregoing is a very abbreviated version of Wittgenstein's argument in Philosophical Investigations. If it is correct, then the attempt to understand thought by what is called 'phenomenological' investigation is fundamentally misguided; for what the phenomenologists fail to see is that what they are describing is the inner expression of thought, but that the understanding of that expression – one's understanding of one's own thoughts – is not an occurrence but an ability.\" (Reason, Truth and History.) 32.2 \"[M]anuals for translating one language into another can be set up in divergent ways, all compatible with the totality of speech dispositions, yet incompatible with one another.\" (Quine, Word and Object [1960].) 32.3 In fact, Putnam's concept of use as here employed serves a philosophically illegitimate function. Like Descartes attempting to reconstruct the world on the basis of God's being no deceiver (discussed in footnote 9.3, above), Putnam introduces an unexplained explainer, i.e., a weight-bearing element of explanation which is at least as problematic as that which it purports to explain. 32.31 However, the same element that is illegitimately employed when used to surreptitiously plug a gap in a philosophical explanation may be transmuted when employed openly, as road signage, to mark the spot where a leap of faith, an intuition, a vision, or a moment of understanding is required if explanation is to be meaningful. 32.4 Quine's essential point may, perhaps, be best understood if we imagine (with Quine) attempting to establish first contact with an isolated tribe, the members of which speak a language utterly unrelated to any previously encountered. Here, translation must begin not with words but with sentences having a comparatively direct relation to those conditions that we, the translators, suppose stimulated the speakers' utterances. That is, we are forced to hypothetically equate segments of native speech with English words and phrases. We might, for example, translate the native utterance 'Gavagai' as 'Rabbit'. Unfortunately, we find there are many possible sets of analytic hypotheses that fit all observable native speech behavior yet lead to mutually incompatible translations of this native utterance. 32.41 As a matter of fact, each and every hypothesis we record turns out to be subject to the same uncertainties as afflict our translation of 'gavagai'. Quine concludes that there is an infinite multitude of possible 'manuals of translation,' each equally consistent with the speech dispositions of a given linguistic community, and that we cannot, therefore, ever be certain of the meaning of any specific native utterance. 32.42 _______________ 32.31 Each and every philosophical explanation necessarily incorporates at least one such element. Precisely which concept(s) in a given philosophical explanation, and for a given writer or reader, so functions often depends on the order of operations employed by the person seeking to craft or grasp the explanation. 32.41 \"Who knows but what the objects to which this term applies are not rabbits after all, but mere stages, or brief temporal segments of rabbits? In either event the stimulus situations that prompt assent to 'Gavagai' would be the same as for 'Rabbit'. Or perhaps the objects to which 'gavagai' applies are all and sundry undetached parts of rabbits; again the stimulus meaning would register no difference. When from the stimulus meanings of \"Gavagai' and 'Rabbit' the linguist leaps to the conclusion that a gavagai is a whole enduring rabbit, he is just taking for granted that the native is enough like us to have a brief general term for rabbits and no brief general term for rabbit stages or parts.\" (Word and Object.) 32.42 See also, Henri Poincaré, in Optics and Electricity (1913): \"If, then, a phenomenon admits of a complete mechanical explanation, it will admit of an infinity of others, that will render an account equally well of all the particulars revealed by experiment.\" xiii The problem with Putnam's claim that the proposition 'I am a brain-in-a-vat' is either false or selfrefuting can now be stated directly: Where the proposition is uttered under the conditions defined by his thought experiment, Putnam is committed to denying the truth of the proposition in each of the three possible contexts of utterance enumerated on page x, above. The first context need not present Putnam with any difficulty: Where the speaker's frame of reference is (i) limited to the presented-image, the utterance may simply be taken (for the moment) as simply and plainly false. Putnam's problem, however, becomes evident when we examine the other two possible contexts of utterance, namely, where the speaker either (ii) intends a frame of reference that exceeds the vat but stops short of metaphysical emphasis 33 or (iii) utters the statement with metaphysical emphasis. Here, too, Putnam is committed to maintaining that the proposition is false or (self-refuting). But, as has been shown over the course of the immediately preceding paragraphs, the only grounds which would support Putnam's position with regard to both (ii) and (iii) are much too powerful for his purpose, in that they would imply a broad-based scepticism incompatible with Putnam's analysis. Although the unverifiable nature of any claim of reference to the extra-linguistic object itself (as established by the private language and beetle-in-a-box arguments) offers an analytic basis for Putnam's claim, that basis is inconsistent with his first disjunct (i.e., his claim that the proposition is demonstrably false in significant contexts of its utterance) and incompatible with any meaningful interpretation of his second disjunct (i.e., his claim that the proposition is self-refuting), for it would imply the meaninglessness of 'I am a brain-in-a-vat' in every context of its utterance, including when uttered by the vat speaker with reference to the presented-image only, i.e., under the conditions of (i), above. Accordingly, since it is clearly not his intention to embrace absolute scepticism, but rather to assert the meaningfulness (and truth of) such everyday empirical utterances as those, Putnam's analysis gets us nowhere. 34 Wittgenstein once wrote, \"a wheel that can be turned though nothing else moves with it, is not part of the mechanism.\" 35 Perhaps Putnam's essential point, like that of Wittgenstein and others both before and after, is only that metaphysical emphasis cannot be meaningfully given. Yet, it is not meaning that metaphysically emphasized utterances have been shown to lack, only the traditional, and unnecessarily restrictive, true or false truth-value; and, though logically indeterminate, such utterances _______________ 33 That is, for example, where the speaker intends to assert that there is an evil scientist who has removed the speaker's brain from his or her body and placed it in a vat, but stops short of asserting that he or she is a brain-ina-vat in any metaphysically ultimate reality. 34 Putnam's claim that the proposition 'I am a brain-in-a-vat' is either false or self-refuting in both of these two later possible contexts of utterance [i.e., (ii) and (iii), above] rests on his denial, in those contexts only, of any possible causal interaction between language-user and extra-linguistic object, i.e., between word and object. However, each and every ground on which such interaction could be denied, for example, the inaccessibility of the extra-linguistic object to the speaker generally, would apply equally well to the first possible context of utterance [i.e., (i), above], and even to such everyday ordinary English real-world observations as 'There is a tree in front of me.' 34.1 35 Philosophical Investigations. _______________ 34.1 See further, \"Introductory Comments to Dissertation Defense,\" The Linguistic Limitation, Mark A. Koehn, unpublished dissertation, University of Iowa (1987): \"I will save my opponents the trouble and openly admit that the argument is, in some sense, self-refuting. If the argument's scope were not universal, the accusation of selfrefutation could be a serious criticism. However, the argument is, in effect, a reductio of each and every set of premises. My working assumptions are assumptions that my opponents cannot give up without accepting my conclusion. The only constructive or positive claim that I make is that of the proof's conclusion: 'There can be no legitimate fundamental philosophy.' To point out that that claim is self-refuting is no criticism of my view.\" 34.11 _______________ 34.11 Cf., \"Every noble and gifted man . . . when he reaches the periphery of the circle of science and sees, to his horror, how logic here turns back upon itself and bites its tail, breaks through to a new form of experience – tragic experience – which requires, in order to be endured, the shelter and remedy of art.\" (Friedrich Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy [1872].) xiv need not be so either psychologically 36 or sociologically. 37 In fact, were we to somehow become capable of treating the ______________ 36 Psychologically, a given individual's belief in the truth of certain metaphysically-emphasized propositions is the first step in the creation of a mythology. 36.1 Although such mythologies serve a multiplicity of functions, 36.2 their origin is singular, being rooted in the individual's acceptance as true of a set of logically indeterminate propositions. 36.3 Both vatand ordinary English are, in this sense of the term, mythological systems, as also each and every p-system, the analytic paradigm itself, and this very text. 36.4 37 Sociologically, the periodic waxing 37.1 and waning 37.2 of cultural mythologies parallels that of the analytic paradigm (see, footnote 38, below), the cyclic rise and fall of which is perhaps the inevitable consequence of the deep grammar of the human brain, through which the world is perceived as a template for language. 37.3 While social change is made possible only by the uprooting of previously unquestioned absolutes, i.e., by the transgressing of that which was once taboo, this process brings with it not only the realization of new possibilities but the erosion of societal belief systems, the passing of traditional institutions, and, in the individual, a decline in the efficacy of moral stricture. It may, consequently, be argued that our present societal value crisis, that all too familiar clime of epistemological, metaphysical, and ethical scepticism, in which little is certain and nothing, certainly, is sacred, is a necessary byproduct of what we, in the West, commonly term 'progress'. _______________ 36.1 \"'Truth': this means, in my way of thought, not necessarily the opposite of error but, in the most fundamental cases, only position of different errors relative to one another. Perhaps the one is older and deeper than the other, and hence uneliminable because an organic being of our sort cannot live without it. Other errors, meanwhile, do not tyrannize over us as conditions of life . . . [and] can be laid aside or contradicted\" (Nietzsche, Nachlass [circa 1880-1889]); \"But I did not get my picture of the world by satisfying myself of its correctness . . . No: it is the inherited background against which I distinguish between true and false. . . . The propositions describing this world-picture might be part of a kind of mythology. 36.11 . . . It might be imagined that some propositions, of the form of empirical propositions, were hardened and functioned as channels for such empirical propositions as were not hardened but fluid; and that this relation altered with time, in that fluid propositions hardened and hard ones became fluid. . . . The mythology may change back into a state of flux, the river-bed of thoughts may shift. But I distinguish between the movements of the waters on the river-bed and the shift of the bed itself; though there is not a sharp division of the one from the other. . . . And the bank of that river consists partly of hard rock, subject to no alteration or only to an imperceptible one, partly of sand, which now in one place now in another gets washed away.\" (On Certainty.) 36.2 \"Mythology has been interpreted by the modern intellect as a primitive, fumbling effort to explain the world of nature (Frazer); as a production of poetical fantasy from prehistoric times, misunderstood by succeeding ages (Müller); as a repository of allegorical instruction, to shape the individual to his group (Durkheim); as a group dream, symptomatic of archetypal urges within the depths of the human psyche (Jung); as the traditional vehicle of man's profoundest metaphysical insights (Coomaraswamy); and as God's Revelation to His children (the Church).\" (Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces [1949].) 36.3 \"There are no facts, only interpretations.\" (Nietzsche, Nachlass [circa 1880-1889]. 36.4 That is, the truth-values of the fundamental propositions upon which is based this text's assertion of the logical indeterminacy of fundamental propositions are as logically indeterminate as those of any other fundamental propositions. 36.41 37.1 \"At the beginning of every springtime period, philosophy, intimately related to great architecture and religion, is the intellectual echo of a mighty metaphysical being, and its task is to establish critically the sacred causality in the world-image seen with the eye of faith.\" [1] (Oswald Spengler, The Decline of the West [1918/1922].) 37.2 \"This is a matter not of mere political and economic, nor even of religious and artistic, transformations, nor of any tangible or factual change whatsoever, but of the condition of a soul after it has actualized its possibilities in full.\" [2] 37.21 (The Decline of the West.) 37.3 See further, footnote 1, above. _______________ 36.11 Here, Wittgenstein goes on to say: \"And their role is like that of rules of a game; and the game can be learned purely practically, without learning any explicit rules.\" As noted above, this emphasis on the use or practice of language is an aspect of the later Wittgenstein's thought adopted, modified, and then heavily relied on by Putnam in his analysis of the brains-in-a-vat scenario. The problem is not that what Wittgenstein says about use is wrong; it is not. Rather, it is that Putnam's employment of the concept does not further either Putnam's own explanation or, more pertinently, the project of the present work. 36.41 One might be tempted at this point to echo Wittgenstein, objecting that a doubt which would call into question the truth of the very propositional system of which it is a part need not be heeded, that even doubt requires a context. In the present instance, however, this reflexive doubt or uncertainty as to truth-values has a context, one forced upon us by the system itself. 37.21 Spengler's theory of history is, perhaps, permanently out of fashion, but the poem that is The Decline of the West should not be. In it, Spengler articulates a vision of the great Culture-Civilizations as organisms, subject to a natural arc of development and decline, passing from youthful vigor (Culture), through the slow decline and increasing rigidity of middleand old-age (Civilization), before ending in a second barbarism. [3] Spengler was not the first to articulate such a vision, of course. Giambattista Vico, for one, anticipated much of Spengler by nearly two hundred years, though the two differ on one important point. Vico, too, foresaw a second barbarism, but one that will be worse than the first, because the people of the second barbarism will lack even the simple virtues of the first: \"Men first feel necessity, then look for utility, next attend to comfort, still later amuse themselves with pleasure, thence grow dissolute in luxury, and finally grow mad and waste their substance.\" [4] (Vico, The New Science [1725].) xv truth-values of certain of our metaphysically-emphasized propositions as undetermined, all of our epistemological edifices would tumble down about us. 38 It is only the act of interpreting propositions creates meaning; and, the interpretation of any propositional system requires the interpreter to take as true (or false) one or more primitive propositions the truth-value(s) _______________ 38 Here, at the intersection of metaphysics and epistemology, we find the solipsistic I, the very cornerstone of both modern philosophy and most institutionalized monotheisms. 38.1 Yet, it is the solipsistic I which in its articulation most obviously violates the private language argument's stricture against criterionless reference, 38.2 the solipsist whose every word must somehow refer to that which is linguistically inaccessible. Nevertheless, the solipsist has available the reply of silence, a silence 38.3 which shrouds equally the blank slates of absolute solipsism and pure realism. Through silence, the absolute I of solipsism becomes the eye of realism 38.4 and, no longer visible to itself, vanishes from the realm of discourse, 38.5 only to be reborn, again and again, at the correspondent point of successive incarnations of the analytic paradigm. 38.6 [8] _______________ 38.1 Cf., \"The I makes its appearance in philosophy through the world's being my world\" (Notebooks, 1914-1916); \"I am the alpha and the omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.\" (Revelation 22:13.) 38.2 That it was not the private language argument but the color exclusion problem which marked the fall from grace of Wittgenstein's Tractatus is a matter of historical accident. Confronted with the color exclusion problem, Wittgenstein need not have rejected the Tractarian position. He might as easily have denied that the Tractarian object can be colored at all, or that a color can constitute such an object, maintaining instead that the object is nothing more than an unspecified, metaphysically irreducible referent of the ideal language.38.21 ¶ No such object, however, could have played any part in scientific explanation. Endorsement of it would have created an unbridgeable gap between philosophy and science, making the question of the relationship between Tractarian objects and colors (or physical objects in general) unanswerable in principle. But, acceptance of such an object would have had other consequences as well. ¶ Such a view, by virtue of the Tractarian object's continuation as the eternal foundation of each and every language-game, would also have carried forward later into the 20th century, and in far stronger form, Western philosophy's historical insistence on a strong (though now completely invisible) link between the metaphysical and epistemological realms. 38.22 38.3 \"In fact what solipsism means is quite correct, only it cannot be said, but it shows itself.\" 38.31 (Tractatus 5.62.) 38.4 Cf., \"Standing on bare ground, my head bathed by blithe air and uplifted into infinite space, all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing, I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God\" (Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nature [1836]); and, from Emerson, it is only a short step to Thoreau, who wrote, \"There is nothing inorganic; this earth is not, then, a mere fragment of dead history . . . but living poetry like the leaves of a tree – not a fossil earth – but a living specimen\" [5] (Henry David Thoreau, Journal, February 5, 1854). 38.5 \"Here we see that solipsism strictly carried out coincides with pure realism. The I in solipsism shrinks to an extensionless point and there remains the reality co-ordinated with it.\" 38.51 [6] (Tractatus 5.64.) 38.6 The role of the verifiability principle parallels that of the solipsistic I. Implicit application of the principle leads inevitably to scepticism, while explicit application subjects the principle to its own reflexive sanction. And yet, it gets at something. ¶ Viewed in the context of the principle's ultimate failure, this isomorphism might be taken to reveal the principle as the I's assertion of its own exclusivity, an exclusivity so all-encompassing as to ultimately allow the intelligible assertion of neither the principle nor the solipsistic I itself. _______________ 38.21 See, footnote 44.22, below, for an outline of the beginnings of such a position. 38.22 Any proposition asserting the existence of any such link, and, too, any proposition asserting the nature of any such link, or any link whatsoever between word and object, would of course itself be a fundamental proposition. 38.31 Cf., \"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao; the name that can be said is not the eternal name\" (Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching [circa 500 B.C.E.]); \"He has a form whereby the universe is preserved, and yet has no form, because he cannot be comprehended\" (Moses de Leon, Zohar [circa 1275]); \"For he can well be loved, but he cannot be thought\" (Anonymous, The Cloude of Unknowing [circa 1375]). 38.51 Cf., \"When the pot is broken, the space within it is absorbed in the infinite space and becomes undifferentiated\" [7] (Dattatreya, Avadhuta Gita 1.31 [circa 900]); \"The 'I' does not at all exist as its own reality\" (Nāgārjuna, Madhyamaka [circa 150]). xvi of which cannot otherwise be determined intra-systemically. 39 If this act of interpretation is to be anything but arbitrary, the interpreter's assignment of truth-value to such propositions must be guided in some way or another by a something-I-know-not-what exceeding the scope of the system itself. 40 [10] Where the propositional system to be interpreted is embedded within another system, however, it may well be that the only immediate requirement for interpretation is conventional knowledge, i.e., propositional knowledge rooted in a system, just not this system. But an embedded system does not function independently of the system(s) in which it is embedded; and, thus interpretation finds no resting point there. It must continue; and, at some point, the interpreter will reach a system that is not wholly embedded, where interpretation can only be guided by a vision or intuition of the beetle-in-the-box – that is, by an understanding of that which is not itself the meaning of anything, but upon which the very possibility of meaning depends. 41 And to what- _______________ 39 Let us now consider a community of speakers 39.1 to whom all metan-p (and higher) frames of reference are unavailable. Let us further suppose that the members of this linguistic community behave as if they hold the Htype proposition which is a member of metan-p to be strongly false. That is, the speakers of this community treat every fundamental proposition within the frame(s) of reference available to them as being, by necessity, either true or false. 40 This something 40.1 and the means by which it is apprehended – call it vision, intuition, understanding, or what you will – may be pre-, post-, or non-linguistic, and our awareness of it is distinguished on that basis from conventional knowledge, which is propositional in nature and possible only within linguistic or representational systems more generally. 40.2 41 Cf., \"The first, and perhaps the only, outcome of man's will-to-understanding is faith. \"I believe\" is the great word against metaphysical fear, and at the same time it is an avowal of love. Even though one's researches or accumulation of knowledge may culminate in sudden illumination or conclusive calculation, yet all one's own sense and comprehension would be meaningless unless there were set up along with it an inward certainty of a 'something' which as other and alien is.\" 41.1 (The Decline of the West.) _______________ 39.1 This might almost be our own linguistic community or, at least, one of them. But, do the speakers of this community also agree as to the specific truth-value to be assigned to each and every such proposition? If so, what mechanism(s) do they use to make and maintain such assignments? ¶ The set of propositions a given speaker, in any community, treats as fundamental – meaning here, 'the set of propositions a given speaker treats as logically indeterminate or subject to a somewhat personal assignment of true/false truth-value' on any particular occasion of utterance is unlikely ever to be identical to the set so treated by any other speaker, or even by that same speaker on any other occasion. ¶ In the end, then, the supposition that any actual p system of significant scope might be shared by an entire community of speakers breaks down and must be understood as a fiction posited for illustrative purposes only, i.e., a stepping-stone of sorts. [9] 40.1 \"There is to be sure the ineffable. This shows itself, it is the mystical.\" (Tractatus 6.522.) 40.2 One might say that at the root of every p-system, prior to both epistemology and metaphysics, there must be at least one point where that which is known is made so only by that which sees, intuits, or understands. 40.21 41.1 Cf., \"I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system. . . . [B]eing human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself – be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself – by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love – the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.\" [11] (Victor Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning [1946].) _______________ 40.21 Cf., \"The supreme task . . . is to arrive at those universal elementary laws from which the cosmos can be built up by pure deduction. There is no logical path to these laws; only intuition, resting on sympathetic understanding of experience, can reach them\" (Albert Einstein, \"Principles of Research\" [1918]); \"Continued appeals to . . . intuition are necessary. . . . [This] follows from the fact that for every axiomatic system there are infinitely many undecidable propositions of this type\" (Gödel, \"What is Cantor's Continuum Problem?\" [1947]). xvii ever extent such intuition, vision, or understanding can be made public, it is made so only indirectly, 42 as reflected in a given speaker's (i.e., interpreter's) endorsement of certain metaphysically-emphasized propositions. 43 Thus, contrary to the quotation from Wittgenstein, metaphysically emphasized propositions are meaningful, and they are so precisely because they are a part of the mech_______________\n\nCf., \"I certainly have composed no work in regard to [the actual nature of things], nor shall I ever do so in the future, for there is no way of putting it in words like other studies.

(He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after he has climbed up it.) . . .\" (Tractatus 6.54). 43 With this assertion the analytic paradigm has been left behind, for this act of interpretation is both creative and extra-linguistic, and that which is beyond words must remain forever beyond the scope of the paradigm. 43.1 _______________ 43.1 Cf., \"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must remain silent.\" (Tractatus 7.) xviii anism. They reflect the inarticulable value choices 44 upon which our propositional systems rest, choices each must make if _______________ 44 The vision, intuition, or understanding on which is based a given interpretation of a propositional system may be said to define a perspective, while the set of primitive propositions belonging to such a system (that is, the articulation of this vision) defines a frame of reference. 44.1 Every frame of reference so defined is a partial model of a possible world, and a given individual's experience of such a frame of reference may be said to define a metaphysical space. 44.2 While a single individual may occupy a variety of such spaces in the course of even a single day, no two individuals ever occupy identical metaphysical spaces for even a single moment. 44.3 _______________ 44.1 Far from contaminating the philosophic process, such vision, intuition, or understanding is essential to it, in that it is only to the extent that the primitive propositions of such a system reflect an actual speaker's or community's vision, intuition, or understanding that the propositional set as a whole may be said to be scientifically, mathematically, or philosophically justified. (See,footnote 40.21, above.) 44.2 For this reason, an authentic philosophy, no less than an authentic art, is always personal, developing always to meet a personal need; 44.21 and, just as an artist may well articulate multiple, seemingly exclusive visions, so too may a scientist, mathematician or philosopher. 44.22 44.3 Nevertheless, it is the act of articulating such a space, of giving public expression to the private experience, which defines the proper realms of science, mathematics, philosophy, and art. 44.31 _______________ 44.21 \"Gradually, it has become clear to me what every great philosophy has been: namely, the personal confession of its creator and a kind of involuntary and unperceived memoir.\" (Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil [1886].) 44.22 We must be able to speak to and for ourselves before we can speak intelligibly to others. Such space defining speech is sometimes thought to be solely the task of the religious visionary or the artist 44.221 rather than of the mathematician, scientist, or philosopher. 43.222 But the borders marked by these terms are neither fixed nor precise, so that such speech can always be read philosophically, just as it can always be read artistically: 1 A sign may be understood as a substitute for an object, but it may also be understood as the means of the object's creation. 1.1 By 'object' I mean not a physical object but a logico-metaphysical object. 1.2 Each instance of a sign's use is an act of metaphysical creation. 1.3 All words are signs, but some signs are not words. 1.31 All signs, and metaphysically all signs equally, bear many of the properties traditionally associated with names. 1.4 What can, or cannot, be said is a function not of signs but of speakers. 1.41 That speakers imbue signs with meaning is a given. The question of how they do so is a meaningless question. 1.411 A meaningless question is a question whose answer is a meaningless proposition. 1.4111 A meaningless proposition is a proposition whose truth-value can be ascertained only from the perspective of an unavailable metalanguage, a term which must be defined in relation to the object language in which the proposition at issue is framed. 1.4112 A meaningless proposition is not necessarily a proposition without sense. 1.41121 Sense, too, is imbued by speakers. 1.41122 Propositional truth-value is the primary concern of the philosopher, propositional sense that of the poet. 1.41123 The concepts of truth-value and sense are not wholly distinct. 1.4113 A proposition whose truth-value can be ascertained only from the perspective of a logically unavailable metalanguage, a God's-eye view, is a proposition of fundamental philosophy. 1.41131 The propositions of fundamental philosophy are meaningless. 1.41132 If there were objects more simple than those referred to by language (and which, perhaps, might be thought to be the constituent elements of referenced objects), the truth-value of any proposition asserting the existence (or, the non-existence) of such objects would be a proposition of fundamental philosophy. 2 What-is is a subset of what-is-possible, and what-is-possible is made so only by its articulation. 2.1 Language, including here any system of signs, is the means by which the what-is-possible is made so; and, it is a part of both the what-is-possible and the what-is. 2.2 The creation of language is an artistic task. Where the system is linguistic, it is a poetic task. 2.21 A poem may be understood as the point of entry into a metaphysical space. 2.22 The poetic creation of language does not create the world but creates, instead, the what-is-possible, the possible worlds of which the what-is is but one. 2.3 The what-is-possible is made the what-is by means of the articulation, whether to others or to oneself, of a private vision. 2.31 The act of reading is also an instance of the act of speaking. 2.32 Because language creates objects (that is, creates the what-is) only when it represents the articulation of a private vision, a poem has no truth-value unless it is given such by an individual speaker. 2.321 A poem does have sense. 2.3211 That is, the poem does not assert, it expresses; it does not say, it shows. 3 'I' is a literary construct, both in literature and in life. . . . . . . 44.31 Cf., \"[T]he background linguistic system . . . of each language is not merely a reproducing instrument for voicing ideas but rather is itself the shaper of ideas, the program and guide for the individual's mental activity, for his analysis of impressions, for his synthesis of his mental stock and trade. Formulation of ideas is . . . part of a particular grammar, and differs, from slightly to greatly, between different grammars. . . . ¶ We are thus introduced to a new principle of relativity, which holds that all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated.\" (Whorf, \"Science and Linguistics\" [1940].) _______________ 44.221 See, \"[A]rt, if it means awareness of our own life, means also awareness of the lives of other people – for style for the writer, no less than color for the painter, is a question not of technique but of vision: it is the revelation, which by direct and conscious methods would be impossible, of the qualitative difference, the uniqueness of the fashion in which the world appears to each one of us, a difference which, if there were no art, would remain forever the secret of every individual. Through art alone are we able to emerge from ourselves, to know what another person sees of a universe which is not the same as our own, and of which, without art, the landscapes would remain as unknown to us as those that may exist in the moon. Thanks to art, instead of seeing one world only, our own, we see that world multiply itself and we have at our disposal as many worlds as there are original artists, worlds more different one from the other than those which revolve in infinite space, worlds which, centuries after the extinction of the fire from which their light first emanated, whether it is called Rembrandt or Vermeer, send us still each one its special radiance.\" (Marcel Proust, Remembrance of Things Past [1913-1927].) xix he or she is not to be reduced to the impossibility of absolute scepticism. 45 Such utterances are, in _______________ 45 Cf., \"Ethics must be a condition of the world, like logic. Ethics and aesthetics are one.\" 45.1 (Notebooks, 19141916.) _______________ 45.1 Cf., \"In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, 'tis necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention would subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceived by reason.\" 45.11 (David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature [1739].) _______________ 45.11 This is Hume's is-ought fallacy, known to those familiar with the work of G.E. Moore as the 'naturalistic fallacy.' It arises from the failure to recognize what is sometimes referred to as the 'is-ought gap', i.e., the failure to recognize that the fact asserted by an ought statement cannot be derived from an is statement. 45.111 It was his own recognition of this gap, coupled with his commitment to the central importance of ethics to life, which led the early Wittgenstein to identify ethics as a transcendent 'condition of the world.' Here, we might opt to state it only slightly differently: The gap between is and ought statements cannot be bridged; if the gap is to be crossed at all, it must be leaped. [12] _______________ 45.111 The is-ought gap is well known in philosophical circles; but most such gaps are not, though they are everywhere. In fact, there are at least as many instances of such gaps as there are philosophical explanations. Every explanation, not excluding that (or those) of the present work, has embedded within it at least one fundamental proposition, arrived at and assigned a truth-value by fiat, faith, vision, intuition, or understanding. 45.1111 (See further, footnote 9.31, the primary text on page xvi, and footnote 44, above.) For each such proposition, we choose whether to believe it or not; and, it may well be the wholly contingent tendency toward an incidental consistency in our day to day choices is sufficient to explain our otherwise illusory sense of even our own persisting underlying selves. [13] Reason can guide us forward from such choices, but it does not and cannot guide us in the choices themselves. _______________ 45.1111 The last three terms above have been used largely interchangeably herein, though one might well distinguish among them. In some usages, for example, 'vision' and 'understanding' are tinged with an air of certainty less commonly associated with 'intuition'. With that in mind, it is worth noting that debate as to the proper role of intuition in the realms of science and mathematics is long-standing. 45.11111 _______________ 45.11111 Intuition's role in the identification of the axioms on which a given propositional system is to be founded may be either restrictive or expansive, and for either good or ill. Thus, for instance, the parallel postulate was identified by Euclid and included in his geometry in approximately 300 B.C.E., on the basis of intuition; but, it was also intuition which served over the ensuing millennia to prevent the serious consideration of alternatives to the parallel postulate. It was not until 1830, when János Bolyai and Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, working and publishing separately, founded the field of hyperbolic geometry, now known as Bolyai-Lobachevskian geometry; and 1854, when Bernhard Riemann founded the field of elliptic geometry, now known as Riemannian geometry, that it was discovered that geometries rejecting Euclid's parallel postulate were not necessarily inconsistent; and, the discovery and development of those geometries, too, was driven by intuition. xx fact, the very heart of the mechanism, the shapers of every propositional system, the wheels in whose turnings are created the interwoven universes of actuality and possibility, 46 and, of them, one might even say: 'Tis neither the Eye of God nor His Voice _______________ 46 For any system interpreted in accord with the broad linguistic conventions discussed in footnote 39, and subject to the limits of both the system's specific conventions and its speakers' criteria for assignment of truth-value, there exists more than one equally satisfactory assignment of truth-values to the system's propositions. 46.1 _______________ 46.1 Although the precise number of truth-value assignments possible to any particular p system's propositions is incalculable absent specific information regarding the conventions and criteria affecting that particular system, there exist 2n possible combinations of truth-value assignments to the fundamental propositions included within a given p system, where (1) 'n' represents the number of fundamental propositions which are members of that system and (2) the truth-value assignments allowed to a given proposition within the system are limited to either true or false. 46.11 _______________ 46.11 Cf., \"Perhaps we need to be much more radical in the explanatory hypotheses considered than we have allowed ourselves to be heretofore. 46.111 Possibly the world of external facts is much more fertile and plastic than we have ventured to suppose; 46.112 it may be that all these cosmologies and many more analyses and classifications are genuine ways of arranging what nature offers to our understanding, 46.113 and that the main condition determining our selection between them is something in us rather than something in the external world.\" 46.114 (E.A. Burtt, The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science [1925].) _______________ 46.111 See, e.g., \"[T]he Hopi language contains no reference to 'time,' either explicit or implicit. ¶ [Yet], the Hopi language is capable of accounting for and describing correctly, in a pragmatic or operational sense, all observable phenomena of the universe. . . . Just as it is possible to have any number of geometries other than the Euclidean which give an equally perfect account of space configurations, so it is possible to have descriptions of the universe, all equally valid, that do not contain our familiar contrasts of time and space. The relativity viewpoint of modern physics is one such view, conceived in mathematical terms, and the Hopi Weltanschauung is another and quite different one, nonmathematical and linguistic.\" 46.1111 (Whorf, \"An American Indian Model of the Universe\" [1936].) 46.112 \"[I]s sensory experience fixed and neutral? Are theories simply man-made interpretations of given data? The epistemological viewpoint that has most often guided Western philosophy for three centuries dictates an immediate and unequivocal, Yes! . . . Yet [the Cartesian framework] no longer functions effectively, and the attempts to make it do so through the introduction of a neutral language of observations now seem to me hopeless. 46.1121 . . . ¶ [T]hree centuries after Descartes our hope for [such a language] still depends exclusively upon a theory of perception and of mind [that is failing].\" (Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions [1962].) 46.113 Cf., \"What is the relationship between hallucination and worldview? . . . [R]eality 'in itself,' as Kant put it, is really unknown to any sentient organism; the categories of organization, time, and space are mechanisms by which the living percept-systems, including the portions of the brain that receive the 'raw' sense data, require the imposition of a subjective framework in order to turn what would otherwise be chaotic into an environment that is relatively constant, with enough abiding aspects so that the organization can imagine, on the basis of memory (the past) and observing (the present), what the future probably will be. . . . ¶ A good deal of this organization is done within the percept system itself; that is, by less-than-conscious portions of the neurological apparatus, so by the time the 'self' receives the sense data it has so to speak been automatically structured into the idiosyncratic worldview. The self . . . is therefore presented with material a good deal of which originated within its own being, at one level or another. In the light of this, the idea of hallucinating takes on a very different character; hallucinations, whether induced by psychosis, hypnosis, drugs, toxins, etc., may be merely quantitatively different from what we see, not qualitatively so. . . . No-name entities or aspects begin to appear, and since the person does not know what they are – that is, what they're called or what they mean – he cannot communicate with others about them. . . . ¶ But the crucial question as to where, at what stage, these perplexing aspects, augmentations, or warpages away from the commonly shared view begin, is not answered by any of this. . . . Up until the last three or four years it would have been generally agreed that these invasions of the orderly continuity of world experience beyond doubt originate in the person, at some level of the neurological structure, but now, for the first time, really, the body of evidence has begun to swing the other way. Entirely new terms such as 'expanded consciousness' are heard, terms indicating that research, especially with hallucinatory drugs, points to the probability, whether we like it or not, that . . . the percept system is overperceiving . . . but the overperception emanates from outside the organism. . . . The problem actually seems to be that rather than 'seeing what isn't there' the organism is seeing what is there – but no one else does, hence no semantic sign exists to depict the entity and therefore the organism cannot continue an empathic relationship with the members of his society. And this breakdown of empathy is double; they can't empathize his 'world,' and he can't theirs.\" (Philip K. Dick, \"Drugs, Hallucinations, and the Quest for Reality\" [1964].) 46.114 \"May the universe in some strange sense be 'brought into being' by the participation of those who participate?\" 46.1141 (Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne, John Archibald Wheeler, Gravitation [1973].) _______________ 46.1111 Whorf ultimately concluded that (1) all higher levels of thinking are dependent on language and (2) the structure of the language within which one habitually thinks influences one's understanding of one's environment (i.e., 'the world'). Different natural languages may, then, be associated with discernibly different understandings of the world; and, multiple understandings may be equally, though differently, successful. 46.1121 See, footnote 10, above. 46.1141 Cf., \"It's as though the world were a dream dreamed by a single dreamer in which all the dream characters dreamed you.\" (Joseph Campbell, in conversation with Bill Moyers, aired as Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth [1988], paraphrasing from Schopenhauer's \"Transcendent Speculation on Apparent Design in the Fate of the Individual\" [1851].) xxi creates the world, but the tongue of man; 47 or, if God it is, a god residing in the dreams of men. 48 _______________ 47 One might here argue, of course, that man's freedom is constrained by the limitations of his tools, that his language, and the logic arisen therefrom, has a metaphysical bias. And, this much, at least, must be admitted: The omnipresent I is not an accidental god of analysis, to be easily left behind in the ruins of the analytic paradigm; 47.1 its ghost haunts each language without exception, and each and every logical system; that is, man's very soul. [15] 47.2 48 Cf., \"In the beginning was the Word, 48.1 and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\" (John 1:1); but see: \" . . . and, when I say that I believe in Him, I mean that I believe primarily in his words and only secondarily in the man; and, when I say that I believe in the Word, I mean that I believe primarily in that which it represents and only secondarily in the words themselves; and, when I say that I believe in that which must remain beyond the grasp of words, what can I say?\" 48.2 (Johnson Hanson, Truth, Man & God in PostModern America [1983].) _______________ 47.1 The I's privileged position, however, is limited to the epistemological realm. The self is neither more nor less sacred metaphysically than are time and the object, the other two points of the modern ontological tripod. 47.11 Berkeley's refutation of the object is beyond dispute; and, Hume's refutation of the I is similarly unassailable. 47.12 Taking these refutations as his beginning, Jorge Luis Borges goes further, offering a refutation of time, 47.13 in which (he states) he does not believe, but which is, nevertheless, as effective in its way as those of Berkeley and Hume, who of course did not themselves believe in their own sceptical refutations. 47.14 47.2 \"That the world is my world shows itself in the fact that the limits of the language (the only language which I understand) mean the limit of my world.\" (Tractatus 5.62.) 48.1 Cf., \"In the universe now there was no longer a container and a thing contained, but only a general thickness of signs superimposed and coagulated, occupying the whole volume of space; it was constantly being dotted, minutely, a network of lines and scratches and reliefs and engravings: the universe was scrawled over on all sides, along all its dimensions. There was no longer any way to establish a point of reference: the Galaxy went on turning but I could no longer count the revolutions, any point could be the point of departure, any sign heaped up with the others could be mine, but discovering it would have served no purpose, because it was clear that, independent of signs, space didn't exist and perhaps had never existed.\" 48.11 [16] (Italo Calvino, Cosmicomics [1965].) 48.2 Cf., \"Far away in the heavenly abode of the great god Indra, there is a wonderful net which has been hung by some cunning artificer in such a manner that it stretches out infinitely in all directions. In accordance with the extravagant tastes of deities, the artificer has hung a single glittering jewel in each \"eye\" of the net, and since the net itself is infinite in dimension, the jewels are infinite in number. There hang the jewels, glittering like stars of the first magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold. If we now arbitrarily select one of these jewels for inspection and look closely at it, we will discover that in its polished surface there are reflected all the other jewels in the net, infinite in number. Not only that, but each of the jewels reflected in this one jewel is also reflecting all the other jewels, so that there is an infinite reflecting process occurring\" (Francis H. Cook, recounting the story of Indra's net, a story first documented in the Atharva Veda, dating from approximately 1200 B.C.E., in his Hua-Yen Buddhism: The Jewel Net of Indra [1977]). _______________ 47.11 Some might expect that causation, causal interaction, or causal connection should be added to the set or substituted into it in replacement of one of those identified above. However, Hume as effectively disposes of causal connection as he does of the I, pointing out that no such connection is ever observed, only a 'constant conjunction' of one event with another: \"It appears that, in single instances of the operation of bodies, we never can, by our utmost scrutiny, discover any thing but one event following another, without being able to comprehend any force or power by which the cause operates, or any connexion between it and its supposed effect. . . . ¶ One event follows another; but we never can observe any tie between them. They seemed conjoined, but never connected. . . . ¶ It is allowed on all hands that there is no known connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret powers; and consequently, that the mind is not led to form such a conclusion concerning their constant and regular conjunction, by anything which it knows of their nature.\" 46.211 (Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding [1748].) 47.12 See, respectively, footnotes 5.2 and 5.1, above. 47.13 \"Each moment is autonomous. Neither vengeance nor pardon nor prisons nor even oblivion can modify the invulnerable past. To me, hope and fear seem no less vain, for they always refer to future events; that is, to events that will not happen to us, who are the minutely detailed present. I am told that the present, the specious present of the psychologists, lasts from a few seconds to a minute fraction of a second; that can be the duration of the history of the universe. In other words, there is no such history, just as a man has no life; not even one of his nights exists; each moment we live exists, but not their imaginary combination. . . . ¶ [T]he number of . . . human moments is not infinite. The elemental ones . . . are even more impersonal. . . . ¶ [W]e can postulate, in the mind of an individual (or of two individuals who do not know of each other but in whom the same process works), two identical moments. Once this ability is postulated, one may ask: Are not these identical moments the same? . . . ¶ Is not one repeated term sufficient to break down and confuse the history of the world, to denounce that there is no such history?\" (Borges, \"A New Refutation of Time\" [circa 1945].) 47.14 The point being that it does not matter which concept(s) we might seek to take as our foundation: Because none of them will hold, we must learn to live without foundations.

Rapid City, South Dakota July 9-23, 2004 xxv [3] Marguerite Yourcenar: The Last Testament of Hadrian Just when the gods had ceased to be, and the Christ had not yet come, there was a unique moment in history, between Cicero and Marcus Aurelius, when man stood alone. * ____________ When I look back on my life, a single face appears to my mind's eye, a single form, caught in countless images of activity and repose. – And yet, memory, when quarried too often, ceases to be the means to what was, becoming instead yet another funeral mask interposed between the living and the dead. . . . At times, I feel I am no longer the man, Hadrian, who loved a boy, Antinous. That man remains in Egypt, holding a still and lifeless body, trapped in a silent, unabating scream, while I have been changed into someone else, an older man, separated from both my former self and the boy by time – and by my own memories. . . . This older man I have become, does he relate the story as the younger would have? I am sure he does not, for I have left many Hadrians in my past, but only one Antinous. . . . To tell my life as a story – is it to find form in, or to give form to, that which has engaged me these many years? – Historians have already recorded the details of my life, and I shall not quibble with them at this late date. Let it suffice to say that I was granted a childhood far from the environs of Rome, though privileged by the standards of the ordinary citizen; that my early adult years were spent enjoying not only the material and sensual riches, but also the responsibilities and fears that accompany the status of being but one of an aging emperor's favorites; and, that I have in the years since the Emperor Trajan's death been the undisputed ruler of the known world. – These are the essential facts of my life; but, no mere recitation of facts can reveal a life's meaning. Still, it is in such facts as these I must look to find my beginnings. * * * As a child I dreamed of being a hero, of giving my life for Rome. This, I believed, would be the ultimate sacrifice. But the hero's feats cost him little; when he dies, he dies a hero's death, his soul, if not his body, unmarked. As a soldier I learned, only too well, of other, more difficult forms of courage, exacting a far greater price. – In the Germanic wars, where I served as a young officer, our enemies tortured their prisoners, releasing them outside our encampments so that we might watch them die. We, in turn, lined the palisades of those same encampments with the severed heads of the hostages we had taken. Where the inhabitants were suspected of sympathy with the Roman cause, the enemy burned entire villages; we burned villages in return. Women and children were put to the sword by both sides, each insisting it was responding to the atrocities of the other. – I have inflicted death and, more importantly, torture. I have used terror as a tool. Thus is war fought, requiring from its protagonists either the brutality of the beast or that harder * Marguerite Yourcenar, quoting from the correspondence of Flaubert, in her \"Reflections on the Composition of Memoirs of Hadrian\". xxvi courage of which the hero knows not. – On my return to Rome, I prayed, my prayers made the more fervent by my fundamental scepticism, that I would never again be forced to discover whether the capacity for either such brutality or such courage still lay within me. My prayers, of course, went unanswered. It was during the Germanic wars that I first encountered the cult of Mithras. Brought back from the Asian campaigns, it survived transplant to Europe in the shape of a secret society of young officers. Through a succession of hot, humid summers and bitterly cold winters, I discovered that its ascetic teachings – transmitted amid the trappings of blood and iron – brought me ever closer to that soldier's god which unites slayer and slain. Such identification grants the god's followers a special strength, preparing them equally to kill or be killed, requiring of them only that they be prepared to perform either task with equal distinction. – My own religious beliefs did not survive my career as a soldier. Yet, I have continued to believe that our experience of the sacred is genuine; it is only the interpretations we give to such experience that are false, perhaps necessarily so. Accordingly, it has been my policy throughout my reign to honor the religious beliefs of the various peoples over which I rule, in the conviction that each man should be permitted to worship at that altar he has found to be sacred. * * * In the years immediately following my succession, my life was richly chaotic, as I struggled to impose my will on this most unwieldy of empires. Eventually, the time came when my fulfillment was complete, when I and my world were in such accord that I was happy without being aware that I was so. With each passing hour, my vision of Rome became more fully realized; and, day and night, Antinous was at my side. – Little did I know, but I was blessed, as only one fortunate enough to be loved by one's own beloved can be. Only then can one fully enjoy the fruit of experience, only then can one truly taste the sensual and intellectual joys life has to offer. Only then is one's attention not diminished by desire for what one lacks. Yet, there are dangers, even in happiness – complacency, arrogance, a forgetting of what life had been before one's beloved. – Of impending loss, there were signs – signs I chose not to read as I busied myself hurrying to reap my harvest, to gather to myself all that life offers a popular and powerful emperor at the height of his reign. * * * I have heard men argue that the institution of slavery is intrinsically evil. Perhaps. But it is not unnatural. There is, in fact, no clear line to be drawn between slavery and other forms of servitude. Slavery is but an emblem; and, many who do not wear the emblem bear the weight of subjugation. Indeed, all men are slaves to the needs of life. And yet, this much is true: As the State must, by its very nature, impose special burdens on its subjects, it ought, in return, to bestow benefits; and, any ruler who would forget this fact, needlessly divesting thereby any significant part of the populace of its natural interest in the State's continued existence, is a fool, for the State over which he rules is then vulnerable, to an extent precisely xxvii calculable by combining the degree of the divestiture with the relative weighted proportion of the population so divested. – I have, therefore, made it my task to ensure that not even the lowest classes, whether slave or free, have reason to wish Rome to be less than eternal, insisting that the institution of slavery be regulated by laws and imperial edicts providing certain basic protections and guarantees. * * * Yet, nothing, not even Rome, is, in fact, eternal. My first visit to Athens overwhelmed me with melancholy. Its past glories cast the city in a golden light, granting an air of autumn to what is become, in actuality, an endless winter. I knew then, in a moment, that Rome must one day suffer the same fate. . . . Even now, our harvest is almost complete, what fruit remains already past its prime. Though not yet evident to the average citizen, Rome is slowly rotting from within. Like a bird, making its nest in the upper branches of a great tree, I am, perhaps, uniquely positioned to sense the rigidity that is prelude to death. There may well be greater spectacles, greater conquests yet to come; but the soul of Rome is already less vital than it was. – Our creativity is already dead. Even at its best, Roman artistic inspiration amounted to little more than a synthesis, a well-organized application of Greek ideals. Yet, where once we might have been inspired to see the possibility of new works in the pieces of a glorious past, now we merely copy, too often badly, what has been done before. Some say this is simply the inevitable consequence of our past successes, that we have exhausted the possibilities of form. But, I do not believe this to be so. The world of form, like the world of ideas, is inexhaustible. Somewhere, between the Roman insistence on a literal accuracy that renders invisible the god within and the Greek desire to represent only that which is of the god, is the still unrealized art of the human. There, existing as yet only in potentia, is the art of Man and his relationship to all that is and, of equal importance, all that is not. The world does not weary of us; but, in a sense we cannot fully grasp in youth, or even middle age, we weary of the world. We are born containing within us the seeds of our own destruction; and, it is we who exhaust our own possibilities. This is, perhaps, as it should be. My own exhaustion is evident; Rome's may be less so. Both, however, are genuine. * * * There are no words to convey the madness which came upon me at the death of Antinous. One day I was utterly fulfilled, a ruler wanting for nothing. The next, my beloved was gone – leaving only the empty vessels of body and name, his absence draining all else of its previous worth. – Some of our philosophers teach that death is simply life's reabsorption of its own latent possibilities – hence the greater pain caused by the death of one who dies young, leaving so many possibilities forever unrealized. It is said that such dead are xxviii the beloved of the gods, particularly those who choose, as did Antinous, to make of themselves sacrifices to love of the living. But what of those the dead leave behind? Nothing is said, and there is little to say. The world seen through the weave of a fine cloth appears softened, but still the world. Seen suddenly without the cloth, the world was, for a time, too much. * * * It is not an emperor's prerogative to withdraw from the active life as age advances, though such may be man's natural course. Nevertheless, I have in recent years secluded myself to a greater degree than before, indulging an ever greater part of myself in contemplation. I have come to believe that truth is various, and that each instance of it must be understood to have arisen from one or another limited perspective. Where the philosophers, with their abstract arguments, claim to have discovered countless instances of absolute truth, I have found only infinite mystery, but mystery within which is hidden the essence of life: My world is not the world; and yet I feel within me the presence of that which is eternal – meeting and affecting, somehow, that which is in constant flux. Man partakes of both the eternal and this whirl of constant change; and, I believe, it is up to each man to find his own balance in between them. * * * I have also come to believe that all we claim to know is rooted in our desires. Such desires may take many forms. One man's desire may be the acquisition of mathematical skills; another's may be to assemble a complete collection of the works of a particular sculptor; and, for a third, the object of greatest desire may be a person, a beloved, without whom life's meaning is lost. . . . Without desire there can be neither knowledge nor action. Thus, even if there were, as some claim, a singular God, subject not at all to human desire, I do not believe he could be an active agent in the world. It is for this reason that, while accepting neither God nor gods, my sympathies have always fallen nearer those who place their hope in the latter, for the gods seem merely men and women of great appetite, and the possibility of their existence is, accordingly, less incomprehensible to me. * * * If all knowledge is, in fact, rooted in desire, then no man's view of the world can be fully understood unless one first understands his desires. – Of all human desire, eroticism is the most important, and the most mysterious. I do not, however, go so far as to assert all knowledge to be erotic in nature. The knowledge of the old man and that of the small child, for instance, are both largely free of eroticism, though the memory of a world passed on casts a shadow over the former different from that cast by premonition over the latter. Nevertheless, I cannot claim to have encountered a single instance of human opinion or knowledge not xxix seasoned, to at least some small degree, by eroticism. Throughout our lives, lessening only slightly after physical release, eroticism colors even the least sensual of our encounters. In some instances, even ignorance may be seen to be erotic in nature, a failure of the understanding that is the inverse of that insight oft times granted by passion. * * * My life, in this time of dying, has led me to believe that even the wisest must live out their lives in what is, at best, a dimly lit room, understanding far outweighed by ignorance. . . . Solitude and the dark of night make up much of what we are. And yet, it is the mystery inherent in the night that gives us cause to wonder, and it is solitude that grants us opportunity. I have been many men over the decades and varying circumstances of my life, some of whom would be strangers to the man I am today, so much have I changed. Of late, these differences have led me to wonder whether all differences between one man and another do not, in the end, result wholly from mere differences in time and circumstance. – After all, were these not sufficient unto themselves to create the old man I am today out of the endless series of younger men I have been? – Yet, is it not also true, as the philosophers tell us, that the soul itself is eternal? If so, might it not be that we all partake of a single soul, unchanging in itself, its eternal singularity masked by those differences in time and circumstance that separate us one from another, and from our own previous selves? – And, if this too were so, would I not, in potentia at least, be both an aging emperor, dying in his bed, and that small child who once ran through the woods of his native Spain? – And, might I then not also be Antinous, with the knife in his hand? * * * If love is to survive, it must change, like a river, slowing, but deepening in its course, as the ages pass and it becomes an intimate part, the defining characteristic perhaps, of the surrounding landscape. Such love requires a lifetime to grow, and lovers who are wise enough to surrender love's fire, without abandoning love itself. What was it I did not see? Was I blinded by my love or by my failure to love enough? I have asked myself these questions time and again, in a thousand different ways, spent these last years of my life reliving his last moments, as if I were the boy alone on that Egyptian riverbank, with the first light of dawn about to break on eternity. But to no avail, no answers are given. * * * Memory is an artist, juxtaposing events transpired months and years apart, one remembrance triggering another, and then another and another, the entire chain related not by reason but by a metaphor or a series of metaphors – the identity of which is only sometimes evident to the soul that is the medium of the artist's compositions. . . . In the end, I find myself oft returning to that time of childhood when the words to xxx articulate the world's great secrets seemed to circle just out of reach, soon to alight on the tip of my tongue – \"There are no gods, and yet no God, to baffle or purify what lies within . . .\" – Yes, this, perhaps, or something like it . . . There are no gods, and yet no God, to baffle or purify what lies within. The round structure of the human skull, fit for neither hierarchy nor the singular truth of the Word, dooms the quest for meaning to ultimate failure, and prepares us for another quest, less well-defined, with outcome less certain.

The value of a basket of fruit is, if we are to be precise, that very basket of fruit; and yet, even though the most closely similar basket is, thus, but an approximation of the first, the very concept of value is rooted in the original substitution, the first such approximation. \"It is not the orange of Cuba but rather the checkerberry of the neighboring pasture that most delights the eye and the palate of the New England child. For it is not the foreignness or size or nutritive qualities of a fruit that determine its absolute value. . . .

No, most certainly not. Will it be so tomorrow? Or even an hour from now? No, though we may, of course, determine to speak, as if it were so . . . \". . . Thoreau writes of this very thing in Walden, stating, 'I respect not his labors, his farm where everything has its price, who would carry the landscape, who would carry his God to market, if he could get anything for him; who goes to market for his god as it is; on whose farm nothing grows free, whose fields bear no crops, whose meadows no flowers, whose trees no fruits, but dollars.' The fact that Thoreau himself does not here go so far should not prevent us, his spiritual heirs, from giving to the set of all non-fungible values the name of the Sacred, and to the things which partake of those values, and to that very extent to which they partake of those values, the name of God.\" – Monique-Mŷstālya Honeychurch, Thoreauvian Economics: Notes Toward a Sustainable Global Economy (1989).

It is a truism to say that life shapes art and, then, art turns around and influences our understanding of life. But it is true, at least of certain forms of art. The tango is just such a form. Thus, for example, I wonder whether our understanding, even our experience of a work such as Federico García Lorca's \"Little Viennese Waltz\" would be the same if we lived in a world that had never known the tango. Because, as every tango aficionado who has ever read it knows, Carcia Lorca's poem, despite tempo and title, is at its center no waltz at all, but among the very rawest of tangos.\" – Gustavo Jorge Merello, The History of the Tango, from Montevideo to the 21st Century (2003).

Upon awakening, I determined, in my omniscience, omnipotence and love, to make this dream reality. Now, in the deafening roar of my last waking moments, I hear the harsh voice of my newborn son taking its place in the infinite chorus: \"I am the Lord, your God! You shall have no other gods before me!\" \"Do you hear the little bell tinkle? Kneel down.

The city in which I was born was completely innocent of maps. Each inhabitant found his way about by reference to his private, mental image of the city, an image developed by simple trial and error. When two people wished to meet, or when one gave directions to another, the parties would attempt to discover a common landmark, someplace known to both. Once discovered, this landmark in fact, two or even three sites known to both parties were preferred allowed speakers to translate information from the 'language' of one to that of the other. Thus, the absence of maps led to no great difficulties in the daily affairs of the people. In spite (or, perhaps, because) of our lack of maps, the poetry of my city was geographic. By this, I mean simply that reading a poem involved going to specific places in the city (often, at specific times). For instance, a poem's first line might read \"The shadows moving across the churchyard in winter sunrise.\" The second might state \"The sounds of the fish market heard from the hills above the harbor.\" Such lines would be considered directions to a poem. Although the poem was read by following such directions, only the set of experiences which ensued was considered to be the poem. Of course, without maps a certain amount of ambiguity in our poetry was unavoidable. I remember that certain poets those whose work was most dependent on subtle nuances of experience refused to commit the directions to their poems to paper. Instead, they gave personally guided tours to their poetry, sometimes going so far as to grasp their readers by the shoulders or tilt each successive reader's head to the proper angle in a (perhaps, futile) effort to ensure that the experience of the reader was, indeed, that intended by the poet. I have not seen it, but I have been told that somewhere there is a city without even the concept of a dictionary. Of course, each inhabitant carries a private, linguistic roadmap, a de facto dictionary of sorts, in his mind. Since each such map is shaped by the individual's trial and error utterances, no two maps are quite alike. * Nevertheless, for practical purposes, such differences cause the city's inhabitants no great difficulties. Like the people of my native city, these people, too, treat a poet's written lines as mere directions to his work. However, the poetry of this city is not primarily a poetry of geographic or perceptual experience but, rather, one of linguistic experience. A poem includes not only the broad meaning of the poet's words but * The man who told me of this city told me also a story of two brothers who lived in it. For the elder, the distinction between the internal and external worlds was a central landmark of his cognitive map. For the younger it was not. Though both brothers were said to speak the same language, and to speak it fluently, the younger treated the words 'ambiguous' and 'ambivalent' as near synonyms. To the elder, however, these concepts were as far apart as the distance between the city's eastern and western gates. xxxvii also all of the associations, all of the linguistic colors, shadings, and echoes experienced by the reader in connection with those words. Of course, in a city without dictionaries, such experiences must vary widely from reader to reader. Those poets whose work is most dependent on subtle nuances of experience are said to have wrestled long and hard with the problem of how to grasp the reader by the shoulders, how to tilt his head to the proper angle.

Sign * Sign becomes symbol and object myth when that which is signified remains too long beyond the linguistic community's grasp. At just this point must discourse lose its literal meaning, becoming permanently metaphorical. Notice that the meaning of a sign is never that which is signified but always (an)other sign(s). The object itself is without meaning. Nevertheless, it is that in which one must believe if signs are to have meanings. The smile, the touch, the kiss sometimes object, sometimes sign . . . sometimes merely symbol. II.

Its historical closure is, however, outlined. – Jacques Derrida, Of Grammatology. xxxix We wait. Like castled rooks We watched as they waited If only Mind and hand did go together! You!

I remember a ditch, with people gathered round, staring and whispering among themselves. The accident had been followed by a dark tunnel and, beyond, a light of indescribable perfection. After the light, there had been nothing. Understanding came to him then, not in degrees, but clear and complete. I am alive, but dressed in dead flesh. This body is a suit animated only by my presence. And among the many things that are mine but are not me are these memories: I am not the one who suffered the accident. I am not that which traveled through the tunnel, nor that which was encompassed by the light. I am that which is, but I am not that which was; nor will that which inhabits this flesh tomorrow be me.

Time in my pocket, blood on my hands, I watched the trees grow, heard the stones crack, felt the earth shift; and, in that moment, madness took my hand. . . . When we were young the machine studied them how they move, how they grow, the relationships among them. Since he has gone I only watch them. After all this time I'm finally alone again, stumbling through these fragmented memories left behind in the ruins of my mind. . . . His memories, my mind. . . . Was it like this before the machine came? How could I be lonely if I'd always been alone? No, it wasn't like this. . . . We danced a dance of chanceless circumstance, before owls dreamed and while gods gave answers to the night. But dances end, and gods must fall; chance today it rules us all. Alone we wander, eyes unseeing. . . . But times ago I saw the singer, heard her voice, had to linger; and dreams returned with sharpened vision. Now both voice and owner long since died away, only memory fragment echoes remain, long past hope that at death's door the dance regained. . . . Would I give it all gladly just to have it all back? I both love and hate him. Everything I have I owe to him, but---people call my name when it is him that they want, and it is him they want, they don't xlvi know me. How could they? . . . Yet I pity him as well. On a morning long ago he had said, 'Let the Games begin', not knowing, not suspecting, finding only later that hell is not the burden that cannot be carried but the one that can, that just barely can. Then he screamed, with my voice, to let them end, to please let them end. . . . The machine is gone now; it had to end this way. He passed the sentence on himself, but what else could he do? He had to be unique, to go further than anyone else ever had. But with strength came isolation, and in the quiet of the solitude he had created for himself he began to hear voices whispering to him from the dark. . . . He was captured by a vision of the perfect language, the language of Rimbaud's dreamed of alchemy, the long-sought ideal language of the philosophers. Such a language as would be a magical instrument that, when played upon by one gifted with vision and skill, would reveal the world as it truly could be; and, in so revealing, create a reality. We both dreamed of this language of the gods, but while he remembered I have only the mirror splinters of his memory and my own scattered memories of things he told me. . . . He said that incomprehension was the lot of the Babelites well before their fall into private languages. Why build a tower to ascend to heaven when you can build a god and let heaven come to you? God is in his heaven, waiting still for a worthy opponent, a momentary companion; he waits, a hollow idol praying to the void for a single instant of value. Where does this God live? Ask those of your artists who caught but a glimpse of that homeland and came running back. Ask Nietzsche, if you dare, he lives there even now. God lives but a single step beyond genius. And there he stays, awaiting redemption, awaiting a worthy successor, a worthy son, the true Christ. . . . Another time he told me that they walk among you having nothing in common save each's isolation from all else he meets. There is no difference between an unworshiped and unrecognized god and the lowest beggar on the street. And while there might be a difference between the beggar and a god who is worshiped but unloved it is not apparent to the god. Yet, who could love a god? Gods may be worshiped or cursed but they cannot be loved. Now do you see how Christ suffered for your sins? . . . Some of the memories are almost whole. His or mine? I cannot tell, can no longer remember. . . . Only, with this axe, I, he, we . . . When he was finished I bathed in her blood. After I had washed I saw that she was still alive so I gave her some of the blood to drink. I thus absolved myself of her sins. . . . She, of all of them, knew what I was, but she wouldn't tell me. She said only that I could tell the one by the sign of the cross and the other by the mark of the beast. But when I asked her how to distinguish the two symbols she laughed at me and said there could be only a single symbol. . . . Sometime later he offered me this: Do not begrudge the god his position. Love is only possible between equals, and there can be no equality where there can be nothing shared. Whether his uniqueness appears to you as the sign of the cross or the mark of the beast it is the sole visible indication of his solitary personal hell. God gives to the worthy, to each, a hell of his own, for we are made in his image. . . . I remember him as an androgynous Methuselah who wore, in youth, any face he chose. His days were spent anesthetizing butterflies and placing them in piles. Yet nights when he was able to sleep he slipped into visions. Visions xlvii of you/me/her/him, of now/what will be/then. But mostly visions of what can't be or what won't be again. I heard him cry, Where is she? . . . Where is she? . . . Now that he is gone the visions come to me, but they must be meant for him, I don't understand them. In one I see a trio of couples. She, red-haired and slight, runs ahead across the commons; they follow. He, dreadlocked and dark, points among the scattered trees; they look. He, blonde and unwashed, seats himself near the fountain in the light of the setting sun, where they join him. But he isn't among them and she is not the one he remembered. . . . In the other dream I see him. Watching a flight of passenger pigeons fly into a huge red sun, he patiently waits for the Lord's last priest to be flung down from the tower, dismembered by the old gods. Earlier, beneath an orange moon, he saw a tall black wolf standing in the shadows near the edge of the forest. The wolf waits only for the fall of the priest to walk through the streets of the city in the light of the noon-time sun. . . . When he left he told me that if I ever chose to seek for the finest to go to Earth's final evening. There I would find all the best and worst the world had to offer. And would I find him there? And which would he be? He laughed at me then. While I will never forget, it is already hard to remember just how it was. The only memory which remains clear is a fragment of his, one single mirror splinter has remained bright as the others have clouded, one thing he said: A new day is coming and these the words left, the words I leave behind. See the sights, the play of light, the light of day under a new sun.

Nicholson and John Dupré 1 OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 2/5/2018, SPi 1 A Manifesto for a Processual Philosophy of Biology John Dupré and Daniel J. Nicholson 1. Introduction This book is a venture in the metaphysics of science, the exploration of the most basic features of the world implied or presupposed by science. One of its main aims is to demonstrate the fundamental importance of such an investigation. Getting this very general picture right makes a real difference to whether we do the science well and understand properly what it tells us. The particular metaphysical thesis that motivates this book is that the world-at least insofar as living beings are concerned-is made up not of substantial particles or things, as philosophers have overwhelmingly supposed, but of processes. It is dynamic through and through. This thesis, we believe, has profound consequences. More specifically, we propose that the living world is a hierarchy of processes, stabilized and actively maintained at different timescales. We can think of this hierarchy in broadly mereological terms: molecules, cells, organs, organisms, populations, and so on. Although the members of this hierarchy are usually thought of as things, we contend that they are more appropriately understood as processes. A question that arises for any process, as we shall discuss in more detail below, is what enables it to persist. The processes in this hierarchy not only compose one another but also provide conditions for the persistence of other members, both larger and smaller. So, if we take for example a liver, we see that it provides enabling conditions for the persistence of the organism of which it is a part, but also for the hepatocytes that compose it. Outside a very specialized laboratory, a hepatocyte can persist only in a liver. And reciprocally, in order to persist, a liver requires both an organism in which it resides, and hepatocytes of which it is composed. A key point is that these reciprocal dependencies are not merely structural, but are also grounded in activity. A hepatocyte sustains a liver, and a liver sustains an organism, by doing things. This ultimately underlies our insistence on seeing such seemingly substantial entities as cells, organs, and organisms as processes. These processes-which have so often been taken for things, or substances- themselves engage in more familiar-sounding processes such as metabolism, development, and evolution; processes that, again, often provide the explanations for the OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi persistence of more thing-like, or continuant processes. Do we not need things as the subjects of such non-controversially processual occurrences as metabolism, development, and evolution? Should we not be dualists, endorsing a world of both things and the processes they undergo? There are many responses to this line of thought, but the minimal condition for a position to count as a form of process ontology is that processes must be, in some sense, more fundamental than things. What this means, in very general terms, is that the existence of things is conditional on the existence of processes. Our own preferred view, which we shall elaborate upon later, is that things should be seen as abstractions from more or less stable processes. Peter Simons, in his chapter, suggests that things are 'precipitates' of processes. How might one argue for or against a thesis of this kind? One traditional philosophical answer appeals to pure argument or reason. Perhaps, as Kant thought, there are deep truths about the world that must be assumed if it is to be possible for us to gain empirical knowledge of it-presuppositions, therefore, of the possibility of science. Or perhaps the way our language works points to facts that are deeper and more universal than the local discoveries of science, facts therefore foundational to any specific empirical claims. Without wanting to deny the value of such philosophical strategies, our conception of the metaphysics of science includes a conviction that such a project must proceed in dialogue with what science actually tells us about the world. In common with most of the contributors to this volume, we advocate a naturalistic metaphysics. That is to say, we think that the examination of scientific findings points us towards pictures of the world at a more abstract level than is the immediate target of scientific research. We believe that, as such pictures become established, they can in turn throw new light even on quite specific issues within the science on which they are grounded. To use a term that has become unfashionable in some philosophical quarters, the relation between science and metaphysics is dialectical. We are commonly asked whether a processual philosophy of biology should really be an ontological project rather than, perhaps more modestly, an epistemological one. Is it not enough to claim that the idea of process provides a more effective conceptual instrument for approaching nature? Several authors in this collection advocate something like this position. But, in light of our naturalistic approach to metaphysics, we do not see a great difference between this position and the more metaphysical formulation that we prefer. Given this naturalism, metaphysics is generally to be established through empirical means, and is ultimately therefore answerable to epistemology. Scientific and metaphysical conclusions do not differ in kind, or in the sorts of arguments that can be given for them, but in their degree of generality and abstraction. If it turns out that process is indeed the right concept to make sense of nature, then this is as good a reason as we can expect for taking nature to be ontologically composed of process. Although metaphysical conclusions are more abstract and general than what are normally taken to be scientific findings, they are not indefinitely so. The essays in this volume offer many reasons for thinking that the living world is a world of processes rather than a world of things, although we do not take this to demonstrate conclusively that the world is processual throughout. We do, as a matter of fact, believe that there are compelling reasons to interpret the physical world more generally OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  in terms of processes as well; and, if that is right, it is hard to see where we should expect to find exceptions to a universal processualism. But the argument must be made piecemeal. We proceed as follows. We begin by reviewing what we take to be the major milestones in the history of process philosophy; we then consider some early twentieth-century attempts to develop a processual view of the living world that turn out to be of considerable relevance to our project. Following this, we outline our particular conception of process ontology, as well as our understanding of what processes are and how they relate to things, or substances. We then examine some of the key empirical findings of biology that have prompted us to adopt the processualism we defend, and we illustrate the value of taking a processual stance in a number of prominent philosophical debates. Finally, we discuss several important consequences of embracing an ontology of processes in various areas of biology. We conclude by providing a brief overview of the rest of the essays in this volume. 2. Historical Background The opposition between things and processes as the ultimate constituents of reality is of course an ancient one, commonly traced all the way back to the Presocratics. Heraclitus is the patron saint of process philosophy, at least in the western tradition.1 The Greek dictum panta rhei ('everything flows') encapsulates the Heraclitean doctrine of universal flux. Heraclitus not only emphasized the pervasiveness of change, but also signalled the importance of change in explaining stability over time (Graham 2015). The antithesis of this view is the atomism of Leucippus and Democritus. The indivisible and unchanging material atoms of the ancient tradition provided paradigms for the various notions of substance articulated in subsequent centuries. Parmenides was another early advocate of substantialism. Although his static view of the world proved too extreme for most subsequent philosophers to accept, his conviction that permanence is more fundamental and more real than change became one of the cornerstones of western metaphysics. It was enthusiastically adopted by Plato in his changeless realm of eternal Forms-and also by Aristotle who, while transforming these essential Forms into worldly entities, nonetheless remained committed to their unchanging character. Aristotelian substances, which are the basic entities of his metaphysics, are distinguished as substances of particular kinds by their essence, and this essence sets unbreachable limits on the kinds of changes that an individual substance can undergo. It is difficult to overstate how influential this essentialist view has been. Many substantialists to this day follow Aristotle in asserting that, to be a thing, one must be a thing of a certain kind, and that the kind to which a thing belongs determines what changes it can undergo while still being what it is. 1 For reasons of space as well as of expertise, we restrict ourselves here to the debate within western philosophy. It is worth noting, however, that process-centred views of reality are quite prominent in nonwestern philosophical traditions, for example in Buddhist thought (see e.g. Carpenter 2014).

Aristotle took organisms as exemplars of his notion of substance and consequently conceived of them teleologically so as to recognize and unify the different stages of the developmental cycle organisms go through. But, despite his awareness of the distinctive dynamicity of living beings, Aristotle is still best described as a substance ontologist.2 Historically speaking, Aristotelian metaphysics provided the foundation for the substantialist philosophy that was developed by scholastic thinkers during the medieval period. Although the scientific revolution is often thought of as a revolt from Aristotelianism, it was certainly not a rejection of substantialism. A central reason for this was the revival of atomism by Boyle, Newton, and others. An atom is a thing or a substance, if anything is. The atoms of early modern science were eternal and permanent in their intrinsic properties. Changes experienced in our macroscopic world were attributed to the motions of, and rearrangements of the relations between, underlying atoms, which remained unchanged throughout such interactions. It is true that, for Locke, perhaps the leading exponent of this philosophy, our lack of access to the microscopic world of atoms justified adopting a sceptical stance about the kinds of entities that we encounter at the macroscopic level. As a result, he did not assume that biological kinds, such as cats or dogs, partook of a common underlying essence. However, this did not contradict his substantialist philosophy; it only restricted our ability to know what kind of substance, if any, natural kinds exemplified. Various philosophers in subsequent centuries can be associated to some degree with process thinking. Leibniz criticized Descartes' conception of material substance for its lack of activity; and he is often considered a process metaphysician, though we are inclined to think that his system of inherently active 'monads' is too idiosyncratic to lend much support to the process cause, at least as we understand it. Hegel's metaphysics of becoming, wherein nature progressively self-differentiates through the operation of a dialectic that continually integrates conflicting opposites into ever new unities, provides something more unequivocally processual. In fact, attempts to apply dialectical materialism to biology-from Engels' Dialectics of Nature to The Dialectical Biologist (Levins and Lewontin 1985)-have many commonalities with the present project. The American pragmatists, especially James and Dewey, deserve a mention as well, as they formulated a distinctly processual philosophy in order to come to terms with the implications of Darwin's theory of evolution, though, given their pragmatism, more from an epistemological than from an ontological perspective. Nevertheless, the figure that has come to be most closely associated with process thinking in recent times is unquestionably Alfred North Whitehead, who articulated a comprehensive metaphysical system that conceived of the world as a unified, dynamic, and interconnected whole. 2 Accordingly, the deployment of his ideas in modern biological theory raises a number of problems. For example, it seems difficult to see how the essences Aristotle postulated could encompass either the indefinite developmental plasticity now acknowledged to be a characteristic of organisms (West-Eberhard 2003) or the changes that kinds of organisms undergo over the course of evolution. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  Nowadays process philosophy has become almost synonymous with Whitehead's work.3 Without in any way wishing to detract from Whitehead's importance to the development of process thought, for the purposes of our present project we wish to distance ourselves from the association with Whiteheadian metaphysics. One reason for this is that Whitehead's most systematic metaphysical treatise, Process and Reality (Whitehead 1929), is generally agreed to be opaque and at times so obscure as to verge on the unintelligible. His system confers unconventional meanings to familiar concepts (e.g. organism, nexus, satisfaction) and introduces a number of neologisms (e.g. prehension, concrescence, superject) and idiosyncratic technical terms (e.g. actual occasion, subjective aim, extensive continuum) that we have not found particularly helpful in developing the ideas that interest us concerning living systems. We also disagree with Whitehead regarding his insistence on conceiving of reality in atomistic terms-a feature of his process metaphysics that we shall return to later. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the panpsychist foundations of Whitehead's system, not to mention its theological character, are hard to reconcile with the naturalistic perspective we uphold. For these reasons, we have found that Whitehead is sometimes as much a liability to process thought-associating it with undesirable philosophical baggage and offputting prose-as he is a valuable exponent of it. In fact, we suspect that process philosophy has not received the attention it deserves partly because of its close association with Whitehead's work.4 So, while we are happy to acknowledge the significance of Whiteheadian metaphysics, the reader will not find in this essay, or in any of the ensuing chapters, exegetical discussions of the Category of the Ultimate, the eight Categories of Existence, the twenty-seven Categories of Explanation, or the nine Categoreal Obligations enshrined in Process and Reality. All things considered, we are more inclined to risk reinventing the wheel than to look for the concepts and theses we want in Whitehead's metaphysical system. 3. The Organicist Precedent Surprisingly, perhaps, we have found Whitehead to be more useful to us through his influence on an important group of early twentieth-century biologists than through direct engagement with his own work. The members of this collective, known as the organicists, produced a large body of literature in the philosophy of biology that predates by several decades the publications generally assumed to have given rise to the modern discipline (Nicholson and Gawne 2015). Interestingly, the book by 3 To illustrate, the journal Process Studies defines its subject 'as the study of the thought and wideranging implications of Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947) and his intellectual associates' (http://www. ctr4process.org/publications/process-studies, accessed 16 November 2017). The Australasian journal for process thought is named after one of Whitehead's neologisms, Concrescence. And the European Society for Process Thought declares in its mission statement that '[t]he society focuses on Alfred North Whitehead's thought in all its aspects' (http://espt.eu/society, accessed 16 November 2017). 4 There are notable exceptions, however. Recent attempts to extricate process philosophy from Whitehead's particular version of it can be found in Rescher 1996 and in Seibt 2003. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on 'process philosophy' (Seibt 2012) also discusses the topic in general terms rather than in Whitehead's own specific framework. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi          Whitehead that exerted the greatest influence on the organicists was not Process and Reality, but Science and the Modern World (Whitehead 1925). This earlier work, written in more accessible prose and without much of the conceptual apparatus that characterizes his later metaphysical writings, presented a condensed history of scientific ideas and argued that the mechanicist, reductionist, and determinist view of nature that had reigned supreme since the seventeenth century was no longer defensible in light of the revolutionary developments of modern physics. In place of this obsolete worldview, Whitehead advocated a philosophy of nature that stressed the development, organization, and interdependence of all things; and he recognized that these concepts were far more congenial to biology than to physics. Biology, Whitehead observed, had historically relied for its development on the solid epistemological bedrock of classical physics, but could no longer afford to do so; it had to spring forth as a unified, autonomous science by carefully scrutinizing and rebuilding its conceptual foundations in accordance with its own needs. As he put it, 'the progress of biology . . . has probably been checked by the uncritical assumption of half-truths. If science is not to degenerate into a medley of ad hoc hypotheses, it must become philosophical and must enter upon a thorough criticism of its own foundations' (Whitehead 1925: 25). The organicists adopted this as a rallying cry in promoting their cause: to develop a new philosophy of biology that would emancipate their science from both the physico-chemical reductionism of mechanicism and the obscurantist holism of vitalism in coming to terms with life's dynamic, systemic, and purposive character.5 The noted physiologist John Scott Haldane (father of J. B. S. Haldane) was the first to use the label 'organicism' to describe his own views. Looking back at his writings, it is easy to discern a processual thread running through them. Haldane regarded the organism as an integrated and coordinated whole exhibiting a 'delicate regulation [that] is maintained, day after day, and year after year, in spite of all kinds of changes in the external environment, and in spite of the metabolic changes constantly occurring in all living tissues' (Haldane 1917: 17). He observed that organisms remain physiologically constant over time even though, from a purely physical perspective, they are highly dynamic eddies of matter. 'They are constantly taking up and giving off material of many sorts, and their \"structure\" is nothing but the appearance taken by this flow of material through them' (ibid., 90). When we study the living world, according to Haldane, we are not really dealing with material things at all, but with stabilized processes. He even went as far as to remark that '[t]he conception of a \"thing\", or material unit, is . . . useless in the interpretation of distinctively biological facts' (Haldane 1919: 125). Another prominent organicist was Edward Stuart Russell, who is probably best known today for his historical treatise Form and Function (Russell 1916). In his later, more philosophical works, Russell repeatedly emphasized the purposive character of 5 Many of the British organicists came together in what came to be known as the Theoretical Biology Club, a group of biological thinkers interested in interdisciplinary approaches to the problem of organization that held regular meetings during the 1930s (see Abir-Am 1987; Peterson 2016). OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  organisms, which are always striving 'actively towards an end, whether of selfdevelopment, self-maintenance or the continuance of the race' (Russell 1924: 56). Underlying this was a deeply processual understanding of the organism, which Russell described as 'essentially an activity in course of passage, changing from one form to another, always developing or regressing, but never standing still' (ibid.). Like most other organicists, Russell criticized the machine conception of the organism for neglecting the inherent dynamicity of life, and asserted that '[t]he organism is not, like a machine, a static construction, but a constantly changing organization of functional activities' (Russell 1930: 169). Russell also drew attention to the temporal character of the organism, which 'at any one moment of its history must be regarded as merely a phase of a life-cycle', insisting that '[i]t is the whole cycle that is the life of the individual' (ibid., 171). As he put it in a subsequent discussion, '[i]t is as a lifecycle progression and not as a static organisation that the living thing is ultimately to be conceived' (Russell 1945: 186). Joseph Henry Woodger was a further exponent of organicism. Although today he is mostly remembered-and derided-for his attempts to formalize biological theories, Woodger published a number of non-formal philosophical works in which he articulated a processual view of life (see Nicholson and Gawne 2014). Like Russell, he felt that '[t]here is an urgent necessity for a consideration of temporal relations' (Woodger 1929a: 299); and he was perhaps the first philosopher of biology to examine the issue in a systematic way. The following quotation, taken from his Biological Principles, offers a flavour of his discussions of the topic: An organism, whatever else it may be, is an event-something happening. It is temporally as well as spatially extended. It has temporal as well as spatial parts. Your pet dog to-day and your pet dog yesterday are two different temporal parts of the same dog, just as his head and his tail are two different spatial parts of the same dog. It is in virtue of the particular kind of continuity of the dog yesterday and the dog to-day that we call it the 'same', and this seems to be the proper sense of the term. But it can no more be taken for granted that to-day's temporal part is the same as yesterday's than it can be taken for granted that one spatial part, e.g. the head, is the same as another, e.g. the tail. We know, in fact, that they are not the same. Organisms are temporally as well as spatially differentiated. (Woodger 1929a: 219) Conrad Hal Waddington is probably the most familiar of the organicists nowadays, as his work has for some time been an inspiration to philosophers of biology sceptical of various aspects of the modern synthesis.6 Waddington remained a committed processualist throughout his career (see Waddington 1969). 'The fundamental characteristics of the organism', he wrote in The Strategy of the Genes, 'are time-extended properties' (Waddington 1957: 189). Biology does not study things; it studies processes occurring at various timescales. According toWaddington, to fully understand an organism, one has to consider how it is affected by four distinct types of temporal 6 The phrase 'modern synthesis' refers to the general theoretical framework of evolutionary biology articulated in the mid-twentieth century, which combined Darwinian natural selection with Mendelian genetics in the form of population genetics and was used to bring together many aspects of comparative anatomy, systematics, ecology, and palaeontology under a common set of explanatory principles. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi          change-studied, in turn, by four different branches of biology-all of which are proceeding simultaneously and continuously, at various rates: An animal functions from minute to minute or from hour to hour, in feeding, digesting, respiring, using its muscles, nerves, glands and so on. These processes of physiological functioning may be repeated within periods of time which are short in comparison with the lifetime of an individual animal. But there is an equally important set of processes, of a slower tempo, which require appreciable fractions of the life-history and are repeated only a few times, if at all, during one life-cycle; these constitute development. Still longer-term processes are those of heredity, which can only be realised during the passage of at least a few generations and which form the province of genetics. And finally, no full picture of an animal can be given without taking account of the still slower processes of evolution, which unfold themselves only in the course of many life-times. (Waddington 1956: 3–4, emphasis added) But it was not just the British organicists who developed a processual understanding of life. The Viennese organicists Ludwig von Bertalanffy and Paul Alfred Weiss, for instance, also defended a processual ontology in their thinking about biology. Bertalanffy (1952: 134) regarded the organism as 'the expression of an everlasting, orderly process' consisting of 'a continuous stream of component materials' (ibid., 133) that flow through it and at the same time constitute it. 'What is described in morphology as organic form', Bertalanffy argued, 'is in reality a momentary crosssection through a spatio-temporal pattern' (ibid., 134). Weiss was equally thorough in his processualism, claiming that biological processes can only be understood in terms of more basic processes, and not in terms of more basic things: 'Life is a dynamic process. Logically, the elements of a process can be only elementary processes, and not elementary particles or any other static units' (Weiss 1962: 3). One of the key implications that Weiss drew from this is that a cell 'can never be defined in terms of a static inventory of compounds, however detailed, but only in terms of their interactions' (ibid.). Overall, the ontology of organicism was distinctly processual, and this is in no small part a reflection of the influence exerted by Whitehead, both in terms of his timely diagnosis of the collapse of mechanicism in physics, with its exciting implications for biology, and in terms of his insightful examination of time, dynamics, and wholeness in the books he wrote prior to Process and Reality (see Whitehead 1919, 1920, and especially 1925).7 We think it is quite significant that the organicists were able to develop a comprehensive processual perspective in biology without availing themselves of the grand metaphysical systemWhitehead presented in that book, widely regarded today as his masterpiece. In this respect, it is perhaps more appropriate to describe organicism as a philosophy of biology that was inspired by Whitehead than 7 Russell, for example, described Whitehead's Science and the Modern World (Whitehead 1925) as 'the most valuable philosophical contribution of recent years . . . which is of the highest interest and importance to biology' (Russell 1930: 179). Waddington blamed that same book for his own decision to abandon geology for biology in the mid-1920s (Peterson 2011: 306). And Woodger described his own Biological Principles, which he wrote before the publication of Process and Reality, as an 'attempt to extend Prof. Whitehead's views to biology' (Woodger 1929b: 345). OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  as a genuinely Whiteheadian philosophy of biology.8 Be that as it may, what is relevant for our present purposes is that the organicists showed the way in which one might articulate a processual account of the living world that is naturalistically grounded and empirically informed. We regard the organicists as kindred spirits and consider our project to be continuous with the earlier tradition in the philosophy of biology to which they belong. Of course, a great deal of progress has occurred in biology in the decades since the organicist tradition went into decline; so, while many of their core ideas have stood the test of time, their re-evaluation in the light of these more recent developments is long overdue. About a third of the chapters in this volume feature discussions of, or references to, organicist authors. 4. Processes and Things This essay, and the book more generally, defends the thesis that the right way to understand the living world at all levels is as a hierarchy of processes rather than of things. Philosophically, this is a radical thesis: as we have already seen, an ontology of things, or Aristotelian substances, has dominated western philosophy since the Greeks. As a result, it is generally assumed that substance ontology provides the most 'natural' articulation of our common-sense intuitions about the world.9 Johanna Seibt, in her contribution to this volume and elsewhere (e.g. Seibt 1996), refers to this as the 'myth of substance'. This pervasive bias towards things is reflected in our everyday language, and it has a direct effect on how scientific research is conducted and on how its results are interpreted. The chapters in this collection illustrate many of the problems that arise from taking the ontological primacy of things as a given in the particular context of the life sciences. Though not every contributor to this book is a fully signed-up process metaphysician, all are exploring topics that point in various ways to the advantages of this alternative position. What is the difference between a thing, or a substance, and a process? In large part, of course, this is the question that this book, and to a lesser extent the present chapter, are supposed to help to answer. A starting point, however, is the following. Processes are extended in time: they have temporal parts. Whether things have temporal parts is a debated issue. Many philosophers hold that this is not the case. As it is sometimes expressed, a thing is wholly present at any moment when it is present at all. Often this position is combined with presentism, the view that only the present exists at all (Bourne 2006). Both of these theses are contested by four-dimensionalists, who think 8 Indeed, it is important to distinguish the organicists from authors who have sought to develop a processual understanding of biology on the basis of the panpsychist metaphysics laid out in Process and Reality. Early attempts to do so include A Contribution to the Theory of the Living Organism (Agar 1943) and General Biology and Philosophy of Organism (Lillie 1945). Two multicontributor volumes with a similar agenda have appeared more recently:Mind in Nature (Cobb and Griffin 1977) and Life and Process (Koutroufinis 2014). 9 Of course, we realize that the concept of substance has lent itself to a wide range of interpretations throughout the history of philosophy, not all of which are mutually compatible. Accordingly, we recognize that substance ontology is not so much a single, distinct doctrine as it is an umbrella term for a collection of philosophical positions that share a commitment to ontologically prioritizing substances (however these may be construed) over processes. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi          of things as 'space–time worms', extending through time for as long as they exist (Sider 2001). On such a view, only a tiny part of a temporally extended thing is present at any instant. We shall not say any more about this debate here, except to note that four-dimensionalism is already halfway towards a full-blown process ontology. Both populate the world with temporally extended entities with diverse temporal parts. To see where these positions may still differ will require further attention to what it is that makes the temporal parts of an entity parts of the same entity-a question to which we shall return later and that will also be discussed in subsequent chapters, especially those in Part II of the book. Equally central to the concept of process is the idea of change. A process depends on change for its occurrence. Traditionally, change has been construed as something that happens to things, or substances, typically conceived of as durable, integrated entities that are not dependent on external relations for their existence. Things, in this view, are the subjects of change, and processes merely track modifications in the properties of things over time, or describe means by which things interact with one another. This understanding leads to the assumption that processes always involve the doings of things. Processes therefore necessarily presuppose the prior existence of things. One problem with this view is that many processes do not in fact belong to particular subjects. Rain, wind, electricity, and light are all commonplace examples of subjectless or 'unowned' processes-processes that are not the actions of individual things. There are numerous subjectless processes in the living world as well: osmosis, fermentation, adaptive radiation, and so on. As Johanna Seibt shows in her chapter, the autonomous existence of subjectless processes is not compromised by the fact that they lack many of the features of concrete particulars, such as determinate boundaries or, for that matter, a unique or specific spatio-temporal location. A more fundamental problem is that even entities that appear to be the subjects of activities can themselves be construed as specific temporal stages of stable processes; they do not have to be understood as things. Though many processes are defined in terms of the concrete particulars that undergo them, the notion that only things or substances are qualified to count as concrete particulars is nothing more than a prejudice. Many processes are bona fide individuals-they are concrete, countable, and persistent units. Non-biological examples include whirlpools, flames, tornadoes, and laser beams. In biology, processes are, as we have already mentioned, dynamically stabilized at vastly different timescales: a matter of minutes for a messenger RNA molecule, a few months for a red blood cell, many decades for a human being, and up to several millennia for a giant sequoia tree. This stabilization can make it easy to mistake them for static things. But, more importantly, it allows them to play the role traditionally attributed to things that undergo processes in substance ontology. The only condition is that the relevant processes must be sufficiently stable on the timescale of the further processes that they in turn undergo. Enzymes can be treated as things because they are stable on the timescale of catalysis. Similarly, white blood cells are stable on the timescale of phagocytosis, alveoli are stable on the timescale of respiration, animals are stable on the timescale of reproduction, and so on. We believe, then, that it is a mistake to suppose that processes require underlying things, or substances. This commonly held belief corresponds, unsurprisingly, to the original meaning of the term 'substance', which derives from the Latin word OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  substantia-literally, that which stands under. In opposition to this view, we take nature to be constituted by processes all the way down.10 This represents a reversal of the substantialist position described above. Instead of thinking of processes as belonging to things, we should think of things as being derived from processes. This does not mean that things do not exist, even less that thing-concepts cannot be extremely useful or illuminating. What it does imply is that things cannot be regarded as the basic building blocks of reality. What we identify as things are no more than transient patterns of stability in the surrounding flux, temporary eddies in the continuous flow of process. The thoroughgoing processualism we uphold regards change, or better dynamicity,11 as fundamental or primitive. This dynamicity is extended in time and, like time itself, it is continuous. It is therefore inappropriate to regard it-or any of the myriad processes that constitute it-as a sequence of particular events. To conceive of processes as series of discrete temporal episodes is to overlook the very dynamicity that process philosophy is intended to emphasize. As we noted earlier, this is one of the key reasons why we do not situate our project in the Whiteheadian tradition. Whitehead construed reality in atomistic terms, as being ultimately made up of indivisible units, which he called 'actual occasions', out of which all larger processes are composed. In place of a discontinuous view of the world as a complex aggregation of ultimate elements, we prefer to think of it as a manifold of nested and interrelated processes that collectively constitute a dynamic continuum. This understanding of nature forces us to rethink a number of traditional problems in philosophy, such as the nature of causation, which is precisely what Rani Lill Anjum and Stephen Mumford set out to do in their chapter. Processes come in many forms, shapes, and sizes. The spatio-temporal organization of a process and its spatio-temporal and causal relations to other processes determine its persistence and stability, and are also what grounds its properties and causal powers. As we have already noted, processes can be 'pure' dynamic activities, or they can be individuals exhibiting most of the characteristics typically attributed to things. Whereas things can generally be individuated by their spatio-temporal locations-things typically exclude other things from the regions of space–time they occupy-this is not typically the case for processes. Many processes have boundaries that are fuzzy or indeterminate, a feature with implications that we shall explore later. Processes are individuated not so much by where they are as by what they do. A series of activities constitute an individual process when they are causally interconnected or when they come together in a coordinated fashion to bring about a particular end. Many of the processes found in the living world, moreover, exhibit a degree of cohesion that demarcates them from their environment and thereby allows us to identify them as distinct, integrated systems-as entities in 10 If we were to use the concept of substance in its original Latin sense, we would say that processes, not things, are the real substances of the world, the ultimate constituents of reality. 11 Dynamicity appears to be a more suitable concept for our purposes, given that change can carry undesirable substantialist connotations. As we indicated above, if change is described as the alteration of the properties of preexisting substances, then it is not necessary to consider it a basic ontological category in its own right.

In his chapter, James DiFrisco considers the extent to which the cohesion criterion, first proposed by John Collier (1988, 2004), can provide an effective means of individuating biological processes. The transition we are urging from a substance ontology to a process ontology has one very important epistemological implication. In any scientific enquiry it is necessary to distinguish what requires explanation from what is background, taken for granted. The orthodox substantialist position of modern science typically takes this background to involve stability: if nothing changes, then nothing requires explanation. This is because the default mode of existence of a thing is stasis and consequently the need for explanation only arises when changes happen to it. For a process, however, change is the norm, and it is its relative stability that takes priority in the explanatory order. If the living realm is indeed processual, then we should consider the central explanandum of biology to be not change but stability-or, more precisely, stability achieved by activity, that is, by change. Take physiology as an illustrative example. Physiology is largely concerned with understanding the multitude of internal processes that enable an organism to stay alive by maintaining its organization over time within a relatively narrow range of parameters. It is quite clear that, in the context of physiological enquiry (which encompasses many more specialized areas of biology), the persistence of an organism is not a background assumption at all, but the very phenomenon that cries out most loudly for explanation. The same can be said of enquiries in development or in immunology, and even (or perhaps especially) in medicine, as illustrated by the discussion of cancer in the chapter co-authored by one of us (Dupré) with Marta Bertolaso. 5. Empirical Motivations In this section we shall examine some well-established scientific facts about life that reveal the unsuitability of traditional substance metaphysics for representing biological reality and which have compelled us to adopt a processual stance towards the living world. Although this book is primarily concerned with the life sciences, we do not think we should proceed without at least mentioning that the physical sciences already provide powerful motivations of their own for endorsing a process ontology. Nicholas Rescher (1996: 97) has quipped that modern physics 'puts money in the process philosopher's bank account', and it is easy to see why. The advent of quantum mechanics at the turn of the twentieth century led to the dematerialization of physical matter, as atoms could no longer be construed as Rutherfordian planetary systems of particle-like objects. This resulted in the demise of the classical corpuscular ontology of Newtonian physics, which had been one of the pillars of substance metaphysics since the scientific revolution. What had hitherto been conceived of as the ultimate bits of matter became reconceptualized as statistical patterns, or stability waves, in a sea of background activity.12 12 Interestingly, the organicists were well aware of the shift towards process that was contemporaneously taking place in physics. Bertalanffy, for example, explicitly compared the processual ontologies of physics and biology, declaring that, just '[a]s in modern physics there is no matter in the sense of rigid and OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  The subsequent development of quantum field theory, which was articulated to reconcile quantum mechanics with special relativity, has lent further support to the process cause. Quantum fields, which are dynamic organizations of energy distributed in space–time, appear to have purged classical notions of elementary particles from the ontological picture. Although contemporary physicists still routinely speak of 'particles', this term no longer refers to solid microentities or tiny impenetrable granules, but to quantized excitations of particular fields. Quantum fields, in other words, are primary, and the various kinds of particles that physicists refer to are derivative entities, appearing only after quantization. Thus, what contemporary physics seems to be telling us-if we understand the equations realistically-is that the basic ontological constituents of the universe are not elementary particles, understood as minuscule things, but fields extended in space–time. Though we are not entirely sure whether fields are either processes or things, they do appear to be more like the former than like the latter.13 If physics directs us towards process metaphysics, and if there are additional reasons for thinking that chemistry is, likewise, amenable to a process ontological interpretation (see e.g. Stein 2004 and the chapter here by Stephan Guttinger), it would be surprising to find that biology pushes us in the opposite direction, towards an ontology of substances. As it turns out, there are good independent reasons for embracing process metaphysics in biology as well, as we shall now see. 5.1. Metabolic turnover One of the strongest motivations for adopting a process ontology in biology stems from a very familiar fact about life, namely that organisms have to eat to stay alive. We can express this in more technical terms using the parlance of thermodynamics by stating that organisms are open systems that must constantly exchange energy and matter with their surroundings in order to keep themselves far from equilibrium. The persistence of an organism is dependent on its ability to maintain continuously a low entropic 'steady state' in which there is a perfectly balanced import and export of materials. When this exchange ceases, the steady state is irretrievably lost and the organism succumbs to equilibrium-and dies. Because of their particular thermodynamic characteristics, organisms find themselves in the existential predicament of needing to act to continue to exist. Although a car cannot function without fuel, its existence (i.e. its structural integrity) is not compromised when it is deprived of fuel. An organism, by contrast, is always acting (or working, in the thermodynamic sense), as it must remain permanently displaced from equilibrium if it is to stay alive. You can leave your typewriter in an empty loft and return a decade later and start using it again. But if you accidentally leave your hamster in the loft, you will not have a hamster for very long. inert particles, but rather atoms are node-points of a wave dynamics, so in biology there is no rigid organic form as a bearer of the processes of life; rather there is a flow of processes, manifesting itself in apparently persistent forms' (Bertalanffy 1952: 139). 13 The argument we have sketched here to the effect that modern physics motivates process metaphysics draws from a number of sources, including David Bohm's classic Wholeness and the Implicate Order (Bohm 1980) and Richard Campbell's more recent The Metaphysics of Emergence (Campbell 2015).

Metabolism encompasses the means by which organisms break down the materials they take in from their environment in order to acquire the energy they need to rebuild their constituents and maintain themselves in a steady state far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Metabolism also includes the processes by which organisms dissipate energy and excrete material wastes back into their environment, thereby conforming to the second law of thermodynamics. This constant metabolic turnover takes place at every level of biological organization. As we indicated at the start of this essay, an organism is not organized as a hierarchy of structures (as a machine is), but as a hierarchy of processes. The lower we go down the biological hierarchy, the faster the rate of material exchange. The stability of each process in the hierarchy is secured by the constant metabolic turnover of components that takes place at the lower level. Accordingly, the stability of a multicellular organism as a whole derives from the continuous regeneration of its tissues, which are themselves maintained by the incessant renewal of their cells, which are in turn stabilized by the ongoing replenishment of their molecular constituents. The appearance of stasis in biology can be deceptive at any level of organization. Subcellular formations such as the mitotic spindle or the Golgi apparatus seem welldefined structures within a short timescale, but when we consider them for longer temporal intervals it becomes evident that they are but fleeting manifestations of ongoing processes of material exchange. These organelles, like many other molecular assemblies in the cell, do not exist as fixed microstructures but as quasistationary patterns-partly fluid, partly consolidated-that persist for a time, before undergoing transformations or disappearing altogether (Kirschner et al. 2000; Misteli 2001). Exactly the same is true for the cells that compose a tissue, for the tissues that constitute an organ, and for the organs that make up an organism. Any given cell or any given tissue instantiates a dynamic steady state, only the form of which persists, while its material constitution is constantly being turned over by metabolic events. Ultimately, this also applies to a multicellular organism as a whole. This is harder to appreciate because the material regeneration of the form of most macroscopic organisms is so slow that it is not easily perceived by the human eye. But consider the following thought experiment. Imagine an extraterrestrial humanoid life form whose mode of visual recognition was based on the enumeration of the material components that make up particular tokens of general types, rather than on the identification of the general types that are instantiated by particular tokens. Imagine, further, that this alien lands on Earth at a particular location and encounters two dogs: a living dog and a robotic dog. The alien scans the two dogs, catalogues their material constitution for future identification, and returns home. A few years later, the alien returns to Earth to the same location and faces the two dogs it encountered in its first trip. Despite being in the presence of the same two dogs, the alien's cognitive apparatus is such that he is only able to identify the robotic dog and not the living one. From the alien's perspective, the living dog of the first trip has faded out of existence, and an entirely different living dog has taken its place. What this admittedly fanciful thought experiment is meant to illustrate is that, if one focuses on matter rather than on form and allows for a sufficiently extended period of time, the stream-like nature of macroscopic organisms becomes perfectly evident. The fact OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  that this does not happen to be easily perceptible to us does not make it any less true or important. From a metabolic perspective, it is simply a matter of fact that, in an organism, everything flows. Of course, this is not to say that everything flows at the same rate. In the human body, for instance, each type of tissue has its own turnover time, depending-at least in part-on the workload endured by its cells. To illustrate: the cells lining our stomach only last around five days; cells of our epidermis are renewed every two weeks; our red blood cells are replenished after four months; our liver as a whole is regenerated on a yearly basis; and our entire skeleton is replaced each decade (Wade 2005). When we consider the turnover time of molecules in our body, the rate of replacement is several orders of magnitude faster. For example, the protein turnover rate in an adult is roughly 8 per cent per day, and virtually all the protein molecules in our body are replaced during the course of a year (Haynie 2008).14 This should not be totally surprising. A cell persists for far longer than any of its molecular constituents, and the same can be said of the lifespan of a tissue by comparison with that of its component cells. In general, none of the parts of an organism is as old as the organism itself. What this implies, as far as you-the reader-is concerned, is that your physical body is several times younger than your actual age.15 Sadly, however, wrinkles and grey hair renew themselves just as faithfully as smooth skin and more youthfully tinted tresses. Overall, the reality of metabolism forces us to recognize that organisms, despite their apparent fixity and solidity, are not material things but fluid processes; they are metabolic streams of matter and energy that exhibit dynamic stabilities relative to particular timescales. As processes, and unlike things or substances, organisms have to undergo constant change to continue to be the entities that they are. The chapter by one of us (Nicholson) examines the metabolic character of organisms and its grounding in thermodynamics in greater depth, and explores some of the ontological implications of transitioning from a machine-like to a stream-like conception of the organism. The chapter by DenisWalsh also takes the metabolic aspect of life as a point of departure in arguing that organisms are agents rather than objects and in exploring the consequences of this ontological shift for our understanding of evolution. And the 14 One might be tempted to object that the DNA in our cells constitutes an exception, as it remains unchanged. But what remains unchanged is not the DNA molecules themselves, but their nucleic acid sequence. The actual molecules undergo change when they are replicated during cell division, and indeed the extraordinary precision of replication is achieved only through an elaborate set of editing processes that respond to inaccuracies. It is also worth noting that even the nucleic acid sequence does not stay exactly the same, given that replication errors do occasionally occur, resulting in minute variations that may or may not result in phenotypic changes. 15 Physiologists, and even members of the general public, have long been aware of this bewildering fact. In the 1905 edition of his novel The Irrational Knot, George Bernard Shaw wrote: 'At present, of course, I am not the author of The Irrational Knot. Physiologists inform us that the substance of our bodies (and consequently of our souls) is shed and renewed at such a rate that no part of us lasts longer than eight years: I am therefore not now in any atom of me the person who wrote The Irrational Knot in 1880. The last of that author perished in 1888; and two of his successors have since joined the majority. Fourth of his line, I cannot be expected to take any very lively interest in the novels of my literary great-grandfather' (Shaw 1905: xvii).

Life cycles Another equally uncontroversial fact about life that similarly compels us to embrace a process perspective is that all organisms undergo a characteristic series of morphological and behavioural changes over the course of their lifetime; they do not stay the same from the moment they come into existence but rather develop progressively over time, acquiring certain properties and capacities and losing others along the way. This is commonly referred to as the process of ontogeny, and the precise nature, order, and timing of the changes it comprises vary enormously from one species to another. Let us take a frog as an example. It begins its life as a fertilized egg, which divides and develops into an embryo. When the egg hatches, it leaves its gelatinous enclosure and attaches itself to a floating weed or blade of grass. It then becomes a tadpole with a cartilaginous skeleton, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and a tail for swimming. Its tail keeps on growing and its hind legs gradually appear, followed by its forelegs. The tadpole's lungs also begin to develop at this point, to prepare it for its life on land. Many other morphological changes take place during this time: its nervous system becomes adapted for its eventual life on land, its head becomes more distinct through the repositioning of its eyes, its ear organs begin to form internally and externally, its lower jaw transforms into a big mandible, and its gills are gradually grown over by skin until they disappear. As its tail progressively shortens, the tadpole appears ever more frog-like, until it emerges from the water as a froglet. Eventually, as an adult frog, it finds a mate-if it is lucky-and the entire process starts anew (see Figure 1.1). Life Cycle of a Frog Figure 1.1 Schematic representation of the various stages in the life cycle of a frog OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  This familiar example showcases some of the problems with the traditional understanding of organisms as things, or substances. When considering a particular organism, there is a general tendency to privilege or prioritize the adult stage of its life cycle (for instance, in the context of taxonomic discussions), as this is the period during which the organism most closely resembles a thing, by virtue of its relative stability. But we should not forget that the organism encompasses the entire life cycle; indeed, it is the life cycle itself that constitutes the organism. Strictly speaking, it is incorrect to speak of an egg developing into a frog, as the egg is really a temporal part of the developmental trajectory that is the frog. Organisms cannot be separated from their history. What we perceive as an organism (e.g. a frog) at any given moment represents only a cross section, or time slice, in the unfolding of the persistent process it instantiates. It is important to realize that these time slices do not reflect real discontinuities in the process from which they derive. Although an adult frog is undoubtedly very different from a tadpole, the developmental progression from tadpole to frog is smooth and gradual; there is no sharp boundary demarcating them. Knowing what we know about frogs, it simply makes more sense to think of them as processes rather than as things. Now one could attempt to retain the commitment to substance ontology by arguing that, despite the developmental transformations that organisms undergo, they nevertheless remain the same thing-or substance-throughout. The problem with this line of argument is that it is surprisingly difficult to specify what stays the same throughout the life cycle of an organism. To refer back to our example, when we consider a fertilized egg, an embryo, a tadpole, a froglet, and an adult frog, it is not clear what properties they all share beyond being temporal stages of the same individual process. In fact, there may well be no interesting properties shared by all.16 Before moving on, we wish to emphasize that the idea of a life cycle is broader and more inclusive than the concept of ontogeny. Multicellular organisms undergoing embryological differentiation are not the only biological entities with life cycles. Cells have life cycles as well, which typically involve a growth phase that includes DNA replication followed by mitosis and cytokinesis. Accordingly, the same problems we have discussed in the context of multicellular organisms also apply to individual cells. Even viruses have life cycles. In fact, a wide range of conceptual difficulties disappear when we view viruses as processes rather than as things, as one of us has recently argued (Dupré and Guttinger 2016). Viruses pass through an intricate sequence of stages as part of their life cycle. Some of these stages are highly stable (for instance, the virion stage, which is what most people have in mind when they think of viruses). Crucially, however, the very existence of these stable states can only be accounted for by referring to their role in the larger cyclical process that is the virus. Finally, we should also mention that, just as developmental cycles are not the only kinds of life cycles, life cycles are not the only kinds of cycles that living systems undergo. 16 Again, one may be tempted to nominate the DNA sequence for this role. The problem is that genomes are highly dynamic entities that are subject to many kinds of changes during development (Barnes and Dupré 2008). Moreover, it is not even clear that there is any unique entity that qualifies as the genome of an organism (Dupré 2010b). OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi          The field of chronobiology investigates the wide range of cyclic phenomena exhibited by organisms, such as circadian rhythms. The fact that most biological entities (not just organisms) exist as temporally extended and temporally differentiated life cycles provides strong grounds for endorsing a processual view of the living world. The significance of life cycles for biological ontology is examined in the chapters by James DiFrisco, Paul Griffiths and Karola Stotz, and Flavia Fabris. 5.3. Ecological interdependence A third reason for taking a processual stance in biology concerns two features that are often regarded as defining characteristics of a thing or substance: the first is that it should have boundaries, even if these are sometimes vague, more or less determined by its being the kind of thing that it is; and the second is that it should exhibit a certain autonomy or independence, that its dependence on anything external to it should be, at most, contingent. Neither of these characteristics is easy to reconcile with the well-known fact that organisms do not exist in nature as isolated, or even independent, entities but rather live in densely interconnected communities that provide many of the conditions of existence that enable the survival of their individual members. Indeed, ecology tells us that the environment in which each organism finds itself is partially constituted by the complex network of reciprocal interactions that the organism in question maintains with other organisms. Some of these interactions are so intimate and so fundamental to the survival of the organism that it has been hotly debated whether the interacting entities are distinct at all, or whether they should rather be understood as constituting a single life. The nature of these interactions varies widely: they can be specific or generic, permanent or transitory, obligate or facultative. They can occur among individuals belonging to the same species or can involve organisms of many different species. Traditionally, there has been a tendency to regard conspecific relations as more intimate and significant. Extreme examples are the highly organized collectives formed by eusocial insects such as ants or honeybees, which are so tightly interwoven that they are often described as 'superorganisms'. However, recent research in various areas of biology has revealed that inter-species associations, generally referred to as symbiotic relations, are equally (if not more) fundamental, and are also more pervasive. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly apparent that symbiosis is the rule rather than the exception in the biological realm (Margulis 1998; Gilbert and Epel 2015). There are various kinds of symbiotic partnerships. Some are mutualistic (i.e. beneficial to both parties), such as the relationship between sea anemones and clownfish, in which the anemones protect the fish from predators (which cannot tolerate the stings of the anemone) and the fish defend the anemones against butterflyfish (which eat anemones). Others are commensal (i.e. beneficial to one party and neutral to the other), such as the relationship between epithytic plants (e.g. mosses, orchids, ferns) and the trees on which they grow in order to increase their exposure to sunlight. And yet others are parasitic (i.e. beneficial to one party but harmful to the other), such as the ticks, fleas, lice, and leeches that feed on the blood of warm-blooded animals. But the extent of symbiosis goes well beyond associations between multicellular organisms (Dupré and O'Malley 2009). Every multicellular OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  organism is itself engaged in an array of symbiotic relationships of all three types with vast numbers of microorganisms. Large organisms ('macrobes') are actually multispecies collectives, or holobionts, composed of many different kinds of microbial symbionts-bacteria, archaea, viruses, protists, fungi, and microscopic metazoans such as nematodes-which live in symbiotic associations with their macroscopic eukaryotic hosts. Importantly, these microbial symbionts play crucial roles in the survival, reproduction, and evolution of their hosts (Moran 2006; Gilbert et al. 2012). Even the microbes themselves do not live independently, preferring instead to live in complex communal organizations, or biofilms, which often consist of multiple species. A familiar example is dental plaque, in which over six hundred distinct microbial taxa have been distinguished (Marsh 2006). Biofilms, just like organisms, have their own distinctive life cycles (Ereshefsky and Pedroso 2013). Ecological interdependence, then, is one of the most characteristic aspects of the living world, and it poses major problems for an ontology of things or substances. One reason is that this ontology typically regards relations as external to things. A thing is taken to be what it is independently of the relations it enters in. A precondition of this independence is that it has relatively clear boundaries that enable its objective individuation as a discrete entity. Moreover, the properties (often taken to be essential ones) that determine both its boundaries and its continued existence are grounded in features that lie entirely within those boundaries. The interconnectedness of life challenges all of these substantialist assumptions. Organisms persist by virtue of the intricate webs of relations they maintain with one another, which in part endow them with their distinctive properties, capacities, and behaviour. In the light of ecology in general and of symbiosis in particular, organisms need to be viewed as processes rather than as things. As processes, and in contrast to things, organisms are fundamentally relational entities that affect and are affected by their environment, within which they are firmly embedded, and which is itself constituted by numerous other processes. Ecological communities or consortia, such as biofilms, holobionts, and superorganisms, are not collections of relatively autonomous things but deeply entangled meshes of interdependent processes. This entanglement can make it extremely difficult to establish unequivocally the boundaries of a biological individual, or even to determine howmany individuals we are dealing with in a particular situation. This is why ecological relations are best seen as an intertwining of processes. The biological realm presents us with a seamless spectrum of degrees of intertwining. This spectrum ranges from facultative forms of mutualism or commensalism among multicellular organisms to instances of fully obligate endosymbiosis, as exemplified by mitochondria, which are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells. We are generally comfortable with asserting that in cases of the former type we are dealing with two individuals, whereas in cases of the latter type we are dealing with one individual, as we take the mitochondrion to be fully a part of the cell that contains it. However, for most other forms of ecological association that lie in between these two extremes, it is far less clear that we can make such definite estimations. How intimate must an association become for two individuals to count as one? Think, for example, of Buchnera aphidicola, bacteria that live in specialized cells within aphids and synthesize nutrients that the aphid cannot otherwise produce. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi          These bacteria have greatly reduced genomes, a fact that makes clear that they could not survive outside the aphid. Does this mean that neither the bacteria nor the aphid can be seen as individuals? One of the merits of an ontology of processes-by comparison with one of substances-is that it makes it possible to embrace the vagueness naturally suggested by such cases. It appears that distinguishing discrete individuals within the deeply entangled flux of interdependent living processes is often a matter of conceptual decision motivated by specific theoretical or practical interests. We shall examine the implications of this in the next section. Although the early twentieth-century organicists appealed to metabolic turnover and life cycles to motivate their defence of a process philosophy of biology (as can be appreciated from the quotations we offered earlier), they did not really consider ecological interdependence. But it is interesting to note that Whitehead himself recognized its significance.17 More recently, Charles Birch and John Cobb have used ecological interdependence as the basis of the particular brand of process ontology (which they call 'event ontology') defended in their book The Liberation of Life (Birch and Cobb 1981). On their view, relations rather than intrinsic properties are the distinguishing features of entities of all kinds. Stephan Guttinger's chapter builds on Birch and Cobb's ecological model to develop a processual account of biological macromolecules. The chapters by Thomas Pradeu and Frédéric Bouchard consider the significance of symbiosis for philosophical discussions of biological identity and of biological individuality respectively. And Argyris Arnellos presents in his chapter a process-based organizational account of life that recognizes and attempts to integrate its metabolic and ecological dimensions. 6. Philosophical Payoffs Process ontology, as we have seen, is far more attuned to and concordant with the understanding of the living world provided by the findings of contemporary biology than its substantialist rival. But apart from the critical question of empirical correspondence, from a pragmatic perspective process ontology also proves to be the more attractive position to adopt in a number of different contexts. One of its great virtues, as we shall see in this section, is that it is able to offer a cogent metaphysical justification for several important critiques that have recently been put forward in the philosophy of biology. Specifically, in what follows we shall discuss 17 In Science and the Modern World, Whitehead illustrated the interconnectedness of his worldview with an ecological discussion of the Brazilian rainforest: 'The trees in a Brazilian forest depend upon the association of various species of organisms, each of which is mutually dependent on the other species. A single tree by itself is dependent upon all the adverse chances of shifting circumstances. The wind stunts it: the variations in temperature check its foliage: the rains denude its soil: its leaves are blown away and are lost for the purpose of fertilisation. You may obtain individual specimens of fine trees either in exceptional circumstances, or where human cultivation has intervened. But in nature the normal way in which trees flourish is by their association in a forest. Each tree may lose something of its individual perfection of growth, but they mutually assist each other in preserving the conditions for survival. The soil is preserved and shaded; and the microbes necessary for its fertility are neither scorched, nor frozen, nor washed away. A forest is the triumph of the organisation of mutually dependent species' (Whitehead 1925: 206). Whitehead's remarks seem remarkably prescient, especially in the light of recent discussions regarding the so-called Wood Wide Web (Giovannetti et al. 2006).

Grounding critiques of essentialism In our view, the ability of substance ontology to answer central philosophical questions is deeply connected to its invocation of essentialism. Assuming that there is some essential property of a thing of a certain kind answers two sorts of questions.18 First, it tells us what kind of thing we are concerned with and hence, more generally, it allows us to address questions about the nature of classification. If we ask what kinds of things there are in the world and how they are distinguished from one another, we can answer that things are of different kinds if and only if they have different essential properties. Second, the essentialist assumption allows us to answer questions about the persistence of things, for instance what it is for the same thing or substance to continue to exist through time. These questions will be familiar to those concerned with the puzzle of personal identity, which considers how it is possible for someone to be the same person as the one they were decades earlier despite having undergone massive change. Essentialism's answer to these questions is that a thing persists for just so long as it possesses the relevant essential property. As it happens, however, essentialism-at least as far as the living world is concerned-is untenable, or so one of us has argued for many years (Dupré 1993, 2002; see also Hull 1965; Sober 1980). The questions it aims to answer are badly posed. The assumption that there is some unique natural kind to which a given organism belongs is false (Dupré 2002; Ereshefsky 1992). In actual scientific practice, different theoretical interests (e.g. ecological role, phylogenetic history) dictate different and multiply overlapping ways of dividing biological entities into kinds. A classificatory pluralism that follows from this observation has become quite widely accepted among philosophers of biology.19 And the failure of essentialism with regards to classification is one of the factors that make the process perspective so attractive. Indeed, it is possible to see the processual character of biological entities as providing a deep explanation of why a multiplicity of ways of classifying such entities is precisely what we should expect to find. Promiscuous realism, as one of us has denominated this pluralism of classifications (Dupré 1993), thus finds a metaphysical justification in process ontology (Dupré forthcoming). But the pluralist implications of process ontology do not end there. In addition to explaining why we should be pluralists about classification, it also explains why we should be pluralists about individuation. Biology suggests not only that there is no single way of classifying living entities into kinds but that even the division of biological reality into distinct individuals may not be a thoroughly determinate and unambiguous matter. As we argued in our discussion of ecological interdependence, 18 There are philosophical accounts that postulate distinctive individual essences (e.g. Kripke 1980), which could answer the second of the questions we discuss here. We shall ignore these for present purposes. 19 There are still some defenders of essentialism (e.g. Devitt 2008), as well as philosophers who defend essentialism generally, without much interest in the practical obstacles it faces in the life sciences (e.g. Ellis 2001). At least among philosophers interested in biology (a category that does include Devitt), they are in a distinct minority. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi          the ubiquity of symbiosis can severely complicate the task of defining the boundaries of a biological entity, as well as that of ascertaining whether particular entities are distinct individuals or parts of another entity. Take, for instance, the trillions of microbes that make up the human microbiome, and without which the human host would rapidly become sick and die. Are these parts of the human organism, or rather just a large consortium of cooperating others? For some practical purposes, for example when describing the conditions for a healthy human life, it will be natural to treat the object of study as one whole system; for others, for example when tracing the various evolutionary lineages to which the various collaborating cells belong, it may be more natural to treat the same object as many. Why should we suppose that there is a single unequivocal answer to this question, rather than many different ones, depending on the issues we are interested in addressing? By analogy to the promiscuous realism one of us has long advocated, the thesis that there are multiple ways of carving biological entities into distinct individuals can be described as 'promiscuous individualism' (Dupré 2012). What we wish to emphasize here is that this latter thesis, like the former, can be viewed as a direct implication of an ontology that takes processes as fundamental. To illustrate this, consider the processes made famous by Heraclitus: rivers. A river is a part of a widely distributed process of water flowing to the sea, but the division of this process into discrete parts is a matter of human convenience, not an objective fact. The Missouri River is the longest river in North America, and much longer than the Upper Mississippi, but we call the former a tributary of the combination made up of the latter and the (still shorter) Lower Mississippi. Is this a discovery, or is it a mistake? It is surely obvious that this is a convention that resulted from a contingent decision in the past. Similarly, on the question of classification, distinctions between rivers, streams, brooks, lakes, ponds, and so on are rough and convenient ways of dividing up processes of water flow; they hardly reflect sharp and objective distinctions between natural kinds. Beyond matters of classification and individuation, substance ontology has traditionally called upon essentialism to answer questions concerning persistence. Things persist, the argument goes, by virtue of their continued possession of certain essential properties, which make those things what they are and which remain unchanged over time. The problem for substance ontology has always been that it is extraordinarily difficult to specify any such change-exempt descriptive properties that permanently characterize the essence of things. Indeed, all of the empirical facts that we marshalled in support of the process cause in the previous section cast serious doubts on the existence of essential properties. First, as a consequence of constant metabolic turnover, a biological individual is never materially identical from one moment to the next. Second, because of its life cycle, it undergoes massive morphological changes as it progresses through its various ontogenic phases. And, third, as a result of its ecological interrelations, the symbiotic associations that compose and maintain it change considerably over its lifetime.20 Overall, substance ontology is not able to deal with the problem of persistence because the constituents of the world-of 20 In the human example we mentioned above, for instance, the symbionts that make up the microbiome of a neonate are very different from those of an adult.

The question is: does process ontology actually fare any better? One of the classic objections to process ontology is that it is incapable of accounting for persistent entities or continuants, which anchor our representation of the world (Strawson 1953; Wiggins 2016). Is this correct, and, if so, where does it leave us? We offer here some thoughts regarding the persistence of processes, which is a recurring topic throughout the book (see especially the chapters by Peter Simons, James DiFrisco, Thomas Pradeu, Daniel Nicholson, and Anne Sophie Meincke). For a start, we do not think that we are dealing with an insoluble philosophical problem, as there is a wide range of uncontroversial physical processes to which we clearly and unproblematically do apply criteria of identity over time. Think of hurricanes, streams, and vortices. A paradigm somewhere between the first and last of these is the Great Red Spot on Jupiter-a storm that has persisted for at least as long as we have had the instruments to observe it, a period of centuries. The mode of persistence of an organism is in many respects quite similar to that of the Great Red Spot. Just as the latter persists by drawing in matter and energy from the violent winds that surround and shape it, so the former persists by securing from its environment the matter and energy it requires to maintain its organization far from thermodynamic equilibrium. The persistence of the Great Red Spot is not based on themere persistence of any of its individual properties or constituents; it is rather something it does-a continuous activity. Even its identity as an individual cannot be taken as a given; it is instead a task that it must constantly accomplish. By means of its continuous activity, the Great Red Spot demarcates itself from the flux of its surroundings. All of these considerations, we believe, are equally applicable to organisms. So what is it that makes the various temporal stages of the Great Red Spot temporal stages of the same process? We take it that the answer must be sought in various forms of causal connection and continuity between the relevant stages. The momentum of the material that makes up the Great Red Spot at t1 explains the momentum of the material at t2, and the external winds that help to maintain the structure of the Great Red Spot at t1 continue to do so at t2. Indeed, a similar kind of story could be told about those surrounding winds themselves. We suspect that this is the general form of explanation that is needed to account for the persistence of a process. An obvious advantage of this way of explaining persistence is that it poses no restrictions on the amount of change that can take place between the properties of a process at different moments in time. However, as we illustrated with the example of a river, the ability to track individual processes over time definitively is limited. Rivers split and merge, open up into lakes or deltas, and so on. What counts as the same river is to some degree a matter of convention. Nevertheless, we regard this inherent vagueness as a strength of the process perspective rather than a weakness. We need to come to terms with the fact that many organisms-including all unicellular organisms-are liable to split; those that do not, frequently intertwine and even intermingle as a consequence of their ecological interrelations. The reproduction of a lichen, for instance, requires the independent reproduction of a fungus and a photosynthetic bacterium or alga, and the subsequent merger of the various offspring with suitable new partners (not necessarily of exactly the same kind as their parents) to form new lichens.

Given all this, we should certainly not expect the tracking of entities over time to be a fully determinate matter. This may strike us as a problem, but the truth is that it is only a problem if we already assume that it should be possible to perfectly track entities through time in the first place, in accordance with the essentialist stance generally associated with substance ontology. An ontology of processes, besides conforming to what biological research actually tells us about the living world, liberates us from the burden of this expectation.21 6.2. Grounding critiques of reductionism Process ontology also helps us to account for the problems generated by reductionism in biology. One of us has been arguing for decades against the temptations of reductionism, temptations that have been exacerbated in recent times by the successes of molecular biology (Dupré 1993, 2010a; Powell and Dupré 2009). Despite these successes, it has become increasingly clear to many biologists, as well as to philosophers, that reductionism is at best a severely limited approach to understanding living systems. While much progress has been made in understanding wholes such as cells in terms of their organelles, macromolecules, and other subcellular assemblies, a consensus is emerging that understanding these entities cannot be fully accomplished without a vital reference to the systems of which they are parts (e.g. Boogerd et al. 2007; Noble 2012). In the context of substance ontology, however, it is difficult to understand where the failure of reductionism comes from. What could a whole possibly be, beyond the set of constituents that compose it and the physical relations among them-that is, spatial locations and connecting forces? A classic argument of this kind is due to Kim (2005), who has convinced many that it is incoherent to attribute to a physical whole any behaviours that are not ultimately either deductive consequences of the behaviours of the parts that make up that whole or causally impotent epiphenomena. This conclusion is often expressed via the widespread assertion that higher levels must at least supervene on lower levels. If the state of the lower level is fully specified, then everything at the higher level must be fully determined at the same time. Any other possibility is taken to be logically incoherent. Such considerations have their basis in the conventional structural hierarchy of substance ontology, which views the world in terms of successive levels of organization: elementary particles, atoms, molecules, cells, organisms, and so on. At each level of this hierarchy, it is in principle possible to determine the intrinsic properties of the relevant things. From the properties of things at one level and from the relations between them, we can infer the properties of things at the higher level. Thus the properties of all things are consequences of the properties of their constituents plus the relations between their constituents, down to the most elementary level 21 Strawson (1953) argued convincingly that we could make no sense of a world without persistent individuals that we could reidentify at different times. Note that nothing we have said contradicts this requirement. It is just that the selection of reidentifiable individuals is less objectively determined than Strawson supposed. Or so we claim. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  (assuming that there is one). It is difficult to see what else there could be that might contribute to determining a thing's properties. Matters look quite different when we view the biological world as being organized not as a structural hierarchy of things, but as a dynamic hierarchy of processes, stabilized at different timescales. At no level in the biological hierarchy do we find entities with hard boundaries and a fixed repertoire of properties. Instead, both organisms and their parts are exquisitely regulated conglomerates of nested streams of matter and energy. The processes that make up the biological hierarchy not only compose one another but also provide many of the enabling conditions for the persistence of other processes in the hierarchy, at both higher and lower levels. In other words, the visible and tangible entities at each level are not simply given (as they are in a structural hierarchy of things), but are rather dynamically maintained by continuous activity taking place at higher and lower levels in the same hierarchy. One of the most significant consequences of the processual hierarchy of the living world, then, is that it makes the physicalist dream of absolute reductionism impossible. The complex web of causal dependencies between the various levels means that we cannot fully specify the nature of an entity merely by listing the properties of its constituents and their spatial relations. It also means that we cannot pick out any level in the hierarchy as ontologically or causally primary. Whereas a substance ontology that presupposes a structural hierarchy of things only allows bottom-up causal influences, a process ontology has no trouble in recognizing that causal influences can flow in different directions. Once we transition from an ontology of substances to an ontology of processes, it is no longer incoherent or mysterious to assert that the properties of the parts are partially determined by the properties of the whole-a claim, by the way, that biologists (especially physiologists and embryologists) have been making for centuries on the basis of their empirical investigations. This point has important philosophical ramifications. The 'downward causation' that naturally results when a process at one level in the hierarchy is stabilized from a level above it has often seemed metaphysically grotesque to philosophers tacitly or explicitly working within a substance ontology. To a process philosopher, on the other hand, such notions present no special problem. In a world of processes, reductionism makes little sense. We already anticipated this claim in our discussion of ecological interdependence. Processes are inherently relational entities. They influence and are influenced by their surroundings. These surroundings, in turn, are made up of even further processes. In abstraction from their surroundings, processes are nothing at all; they have no independent existence. One needs only to think of waves in an ocean or of gusts of wind in a storm. A process has the properties it does in no small part because of its relations with other processes. Consequently, it cannot be fully explained independently of these relations. A necessary condition for reductionism is that it must be possible to treat entities independently from one another and to consider their structure and constitution independently of the context in which they exist. But this is precisely what an ontology of processes denies. When we accept that the living world is a process world, we are able to understand why reductionism in biology, despite its countless limited successes in local and fixed contexts, can never fully succeed as a global explanatory enterprise, even in principle.

Grounding critiques of mechanicism Ever since the scientific revolution, substance ontology has been associated with mechanicism, the view that nature, together with everything in it, is a machine that operates in a regular and predictable manner and that can be fully explained in mechanical terms. Mechanicism is, of course, a natural expression of substance thought, as machines instantiate many of the properties traditionally attributed to substances: they are fixed material entities with clearly defined boundaries and exist independently of the activities they engage in and of the relations they maintain with other entities. It is not surprising, then, that mechanicism is perfectly consistent with both essentialism and reductionism; a machine is taken to belong to a particular kind because it exhibits certain unchanging properties, and its organization and operation can be completely accounted for in terms of its component parts and their interactions. Although physics emancipated itself from the mechanicist worldview at the turn of the twentieth century (which is partly what led Whitehead to embrace process metaphysics, as we indicated earlier), mechanicism never really lost its grip on biology; on the contrary, it tightened it after the rise of molecular biology. Nowadays it is not uncommon to regard protein complexes as ingeniously designed molecular machines, cells as intricate sets of circuits that can be partially re-engineered to function in accordance with our needs, development as the computable execution of a deterministic genetic program, or the products of evolutionary change as analogous with optimally designed artefacts. However, it is becoming ever more apparent that all of these views are deeply problematic, as both of us have argued in earlier work (Dupré 2008; Nicholson 2013, 2014). One very appealing aspect of the process perspective is that it makes the ontological inadequacy of the machine conception of the organism explicit. If organisms are processes rather than substances, then conceiving of them as machines inevitably leads to a distorted understanding of them. Looking back once more at the three empirical motivations we discussed for adopting a process ontology, it is significant that all of them also constitute reasons for resisting the ontological assimilation of organisms to machines. First, the reality of metabolic turnover means that the very structure of every organism, unlike that of any machine, is wholly and continuously reconstituted as a result of its operation. Second, the life cycle an organism undergoes is unlike anything a machine ever experiences. Machines do not develop, nor do they reproduce; their configuration is fixed upon their manufacture, as opposed to that of organisms. And, third, as a consequence of ecological interdependence, no organism can function, or even persist, independently of the entangled web of interrelations it maintains with other organisms. By contrast, the persistence or operation of machines does not depend on their capacity to maintain relations with other machines. Your microwave does not require the presence of other microwaves to heat your food, let alone to persist in your kitchen. By adopting a process ontology we become far less likely to be tempted by the machine conception of the organism, which for many biologists (and for some philosophers) still constitutes the default, and often tacit, ontological understanding of living systems. But process thinking allows us to do even more. In addition to legitimating and encouraging the recourse to machine analogies in the living world, mechanicism has OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  permeated modern biology in another, more subtle way, namely by popularizing the view that living systems can be fully explained by describing the causal mechanisms that are said to be operating within them. The word 'mechanism' of course is etymologically related to the word 'machine', but today the term refers more loosely to a set of components that causally interact in a regular fashion to produce a phenomenon of interest. The recent realization that biologists frequently invoke mechanisms in their explanations of phenomena has led to an explosion of interest in the philosophy of science, as a growing number of philosophers have tried to come to terms with the nature and scope of so-called mechanistic explanations (e.g. Machamer et al. 2000; Glennan 2002; Bechtel 2006; Craver 2007; Craver and Darden 2013). Although it is undeniable that the elucidation of biological phenomena in terms of mechanisms has proven to be an enormously productive scientific strategy, mechanistic explanations are inherently limited in what they can tell us about living systems, or so we have claimed in previous publications (Nicholson 2012; Dupré 2013). The value of the process perspective in this context is that it helps us to explain these limits. The view that mechanistic explanations are in principle capable of providing a complete understanding of living systems is problematic because it presupposes an ontology in which substances at least play the central role.22 The ontological picture that typically motivates appeals to mechanisms is one in which living processes ultimately derive from, and can therefore be explained by, the systematic rearrangement of the preexisting thing-like entities that compose them. But, on the view we have been developing, the components of an organism, be it multicellular or unicellular, are just as much processes as the organism itself. The constituents of a higher-level process do not suffice to explain it, because they themselves-or, more specifically, their stability and activity-cannot be fully understood without reference to that same process, as well as to those above it. The mereological, bottom-up character of mechanistic explanations means that their deployment in a world of processes is inevitably subject to the same limits as more traditional forms of reductionism. Why, then, have mechanistic explanations turned out to be as successful in biology as they undoubtedly have been? A process perspective allows us to answer this question as well. The reason why mechanistic explanations provide insights (to the extent that they do) is that the components of the mechanisms being described are sufficiently stable on the timescale of the phenomena under investigation. For example, it is possible to explain the phenomenon of muscle contraction in mechanistic terms because the entities primarily responsible for it, namely the actin and myosin filaments in the muscle fibre, are sufficiently stable during the temporal interval in which contraction occurs to be treated as thing-like components of a mechanism. However, this does not mean that actin and myosin filaments really are inherently stable constituents of muscles, for if we change our research question and 22 We do not say that they presuppose a substance ontology tout court because, following the canonical statement by Machamer et al. (2000), some philosophical accounts of mechanisms are explicitly dualistic, endorsing both 'entities' (i.e. substances) and 'activities' (i.e. processes). Nevertheless, processes in mechanistic accounts tend to play a role similar to that of properties in standard substance ontology. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi          inquire instead into the growth of muscular tissue during development-a phenomenon that takes place over a much longer timescale-it is not possible to discern any specific muscle fibres, let alone any actin and myosin filaments within them, that persist for the entire duration of development. In this epistemic context we can no longer characterize actin and myosin filaments as thing-like components of a mechanism, as they themselves now appear to be dynamic and transient entities. Mechanism descriptions, therefore, are accurate only on the particular timescales of the phenomena they are called upon to explain. A key implication that we take to follow from this is that the mechanisms described in mechanistic explanations should not be treated, in accordance with the assumptions of the older mechanicist tradition, as real things that ontologically make up organisms (in the way they might be supposed to make up machines). Rather, mechanisms in biology are more appropriately understood as heuristic explanatory devices-as idealized spatio-temporal cross sections of living systems that conveniently abstract away the complexity and dynamicity of their biotic and abiotic surroundings and pick out only the causal relations that are taken to be most relevant for controlling and manipulating the phenomena under investigation (Nicholson 2012; Dupré 2013). To suppose that mechanisms are the ontological building blocks of living systems is to commit what Whitehead famously called 'the fallacy of misplaced concreteness' (Whitehead 1925: 52), which occurs every time we confuse our conceptual schemas, models, and analogies with the way things really are. What biologists describe as mechanisms (and their components) are actually manifestations of specific patterns of stability of different processes that unfold concurrently in living systems. Process ontology enables us to understand the limits of mechanistic explanations in biology while simultaneously recognizing and accounting for the scope of their effectiveness. 7. Biological Consequences The move from substance ontology to process ontology has many interesting biological consequences. We have examined some of them over the course of this essay, and many more are explored by other authors in the remainder of this book. Some of these consequences are far from obvious. Ann-Sophie Barwich, for instance, shows in her chapter how a process perspective on perception results in a far more contextual understanding of olfaction than has been traditionally supposed. Moreover, not all of the consequences discussed in the chapters of this book are purely theoretical in character; quite a few of them are closely tied to practical issues. For example, Eric Bapteste and Gemma Anderson argue in their chapter that an increasing appreciation of the evolutionary role of biological processes requires new ways of representing them for analytical purposes. Before we conclude, we wish to discuss a few rather significant consequences of embracing an ontology of processes in biology that are not directly covered in subsequent chapters. We present these reflections in order to give the reader a fuller sense of the wide-ranging implications of our project, as well as to offer a glimpse of the work that still remains to be done. Below we consider some specific consequences for physiology, genetics, evolution, and medicine. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  7.1. Physiology Physiology has traditionally been concerned with the study of function. This emphasis on function in turn has tended to direct physiological research towards the analysis of structure. The reason for this is that it has generally been assumed, in accordance with substance ontology, that structures somehow ground the capacities that constitute functions. Structures are taken to be more or less fixed, and ontologically prior to the functions associated with them. This substantialist understanding pervades the longstanding philosophical debate on function, where, despite major disagreements, the function of an entity-whether or not it is tied to the explanation of its selective advantage-is seen as that entity's contribution to a larger system; and this contribution is made possible by the entity's structural properties. One consequence of the process perspective in biology is that it calls into question this familiar and widespread view. The various structures that an organism exhibits are not really fixed, but are instead continuously maintained by a large number of carefully regulated processes, which endow them with their relative stability. These structures cannot be taken for granted in our physiological explanations, as they must themselves be accounted for by the various functional activities that enable them to persist through time. It is therefore incorrect to assume that structures are prior to functions, or that functions are determined by structures. The processual nature of organisms means that changes in their functional demands will tend to result in changes in how they maintain and regenerate their respective structures. In biology the relation between structure and function is not linear and unidirectional, as is often supposed, but circular and symmetrical. Neither of the two can be privileged over the other, or even be understood without appealing to the other. This key insight was already recognized by the organicists working to develop a processual biology in the early decades of the twentieth century. Most of them explicitly argued that structure and function are mutually interdependent features of organisms. As Haldane elegantly expressed it, '[s]tructure and functional relation to environment cannot be separated in the serious scientific study of life, since structure expresses the maintenance of function, and function expresses the maintenance of structure' (Haldane 1931: 22). Structures are not simply given, but instead reflect the stability of functional activities, which are themselves maintained by stable structures. In the last analysis, it makes no sense to separate structure and function, as the two represent different yet complementary 'ways of seeing' the processual reality of living systems, one emphasizing stability and the other emphasizing dynamicity. According to Bertalanffy, '[t]he old contrast between \"structure\" and \"function\" is to be reduced to the relative speed of processes within the organism. Structures are extended, slow processes; functions are transitory, rapid processes' (Bertalanffy 1941: 251). We are inclined to think of structure and function in biology as alternative forms of abstraction from the continuous flow of underlying processes. Structural descriptions abstract away the temporal dimension, as well as selecting non-arbitrary but underdetermined spatial limits for the entities of interest. Functional descriptions bring back the temporal dimension, but they do so at the cost of focusing on a highly specific set of properties of the entities under consideration. More needs to be said, OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi          probably, about how structural and functional characterizations abstract.23 The relevant point for now is that, even though linear explanations of function in terms of structure serve valuable purposes in biological research, we need to keep in mind that they provide limited perspectives on biological phenomena. It is always possible, it seems to us, and ultimately even necessary, to treat biological structures as explananda as well as explanantia. 7.2. Genetics Adopting a process ontology in biology also has an impact on how we think about inheritance. Genetics is generally thought to have originated with Mendel's famous experiments on peas, which concerned dichotomous characteristics that eventually came to be explained in terms of underlying invisible factors called genes. The consequent view that all the heritable information transmitted from parent to offspring resides in material particles, namely genes, which replicate during reproduction and trigger the developmental construction of the new individual, has proved remarkably resilient even as its empirical basis has been increasingly eroded. This understanding fits naturally with a substance ontology, as it regards what is inherited as a collection of things-genes-together with their defining properties, namely the dispositions to cause phenotypic effects. A process perspective brings to the foreground two major problems with this substantialist picture. The first has to do with the supposed atomistic nature of genes, and the second concerns the view of reproduction as the transmission of a set of things, an act construed as a sort of passing of genetic batons. When genes were first imagined as discrete entities carrying phenotypic information, their ontological status was entirely hypothetical. Although the reality of these entities became progressively accepted, no consensus was reached on their nature until the famous elucidation of the structure of DNA in 1953. As the implications of that discovery became apparent, the view emerged that genes are stretches of DNA defined by a specific sequence of nucleotides, the four chemical structures that alternate in the DNAmolecule and provide the information necessary to generate a protein, conceived of as the paradigmatic functional molecule. Genes for all kinds of phenotypic traits- from fur colour to sexual preference-were conceived of as sequences of nucleotides that have the power to cause or alter these developmental outcomes. This traditional picture has, however, been very widely rejected (see e.g. Keller 2000). The development of most traits is now understood to involve features widely distributed across the genome as well as influences from many aspects of the external environment. This has led to growing doubts about the ontological significance of genes as discrete components of genomes, which in turn has prompted a more direct focus on the genome itself (Barnes and Dupré 2008). The genome, far from being a fixed source of developmental information, is now increasingly seen as a thoroughly processual entity. The stability of the nucleotide sequence, which is so crucial to its functioning, is dependent on multiple processes of correction and editing that 23 It would appear-we note in passing-that distinguishing biological mechanisms involves abstractions of both kinds. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  drastically reduce the error rate in its replication. Moreover, the functioning of the genome involves constant changes in its physical conformation that allow the appropriate parts to be more or less accessible for transcription. These changes are in turn partly controlled by certain molecules' attachment to and detachment from particular points on the genome, a process referred to as the epigenetic modification of the genome. Epigenetic effects are at the end of a causal chain that can begin far away, for example with maternal interaction with an infant organism (Champagne et al. 2006). Importantly, such causal processes allow environmental factors to affect the functioning of the genome. Taking a broader view, what these genomic activities indicate is that, far from there being a one-way control of the cell by the genome, as is still sometimes imagined, the genome is in constant two-way interaction with its cellular context and beyond. The persistence of both, in fact, depends on their interrelations. In short, where once we saw a genome as a set of discrete units or things mechanically controlling their wider environment, now we see interactions of a complex dynamic entity with its even more complex surroundings. Genetic replication is another vital process ripe for reconsideration from a process perspective. Whereas in the context of substance ontology it may seem natural to conceive of replication as simply the copying and production of one thing on the basis of another-something akin to making a photocopy (see Dawkins 1982)-the generation of one process by another is a rather different matter. As James Griesemer (2000, 2005a, 2005b) has emphasized in a series of papers, biological reproduction- unlike photocopying, in which only a re-production of information is required- involves a degree of material continuity between the original and the descendant. Indeed, in the replication of DNA, new double helices are partially constituted from the material of the old double helices. Treating replication as copying has the inadvertent consequence of diverting attention from the causal process that generates it. DNA does not 'self-replicate', as it is sometimes claimed, but is completely dependent for its replication on the participation of an intricate molecular 'machinery'. To think of replication, and by implication of reproduction, as analogous with copying is to abstract away the causality and materiality of the connection between parent and offspring, reducing this connection to an essentially informational relation. While mechanicist biologists convinced of the machine-like nature of living systems will be comfortable comparing the role of replication in reproduction with the digital duplication of software systems, a biologist committed to a processual understanding of the living world is far less likely to be seduced by such analogies. When parents are recognized as self-maintaining metabolic processes from which offspring somehow branch off, it becomes clear that reproduction must involve material overlap between the two. Accounts of reproduction that fail to include this aspect neglect one of its essential features. Classical models of transmission genetics, Weismann's famous separation of germ and soma, and the more contemporary notion of the genetic program have enabled geneticists to study inheritance as a mere cluster of relations between things, but at the cost of abstracting it from the actual processes of reproduction and development that generate these relations. Although such models have proven to be useful heuristics for scientific research, an adequate theory of inheritance must ultimately include these fundamental processes. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi          In the end, a process ontology forces us to expand our understanding of inheritance itself. Recognizing the material overlap between parent and offspring in reproduction makes it obvious that what gets transmitted is much more than just the DNA. The material (i.e. cytoplasmic) continuum that exists between parent and offspring includes many molecular systems that can be inherited apart from the genome, such as macromolecular steady states and self-sustaining metabolic loops (see Jablonka and Lamb 2005). Because these epigenetic inheritance systems typically depend on chemical diffusion and molecular transport processes, they exhibit far lower degrees of fidelity than the nucleic acid coding mechanism characteristic of genetic replication. But this does not mean that they are not capable of affecting developmental outcomes; they are, and they do. Once we adopt a processual point of view, the detection of epigenetically inherited traits ceases to be a baffling discovery and becomes something we would actually expect to find. 7.3. Evolution While it is self-evident that evolution is a process, it is less clear how we should think about the nature of the entities that participate in this process. The traditional substantialist stance has been to regard them as things. Process ontology, of course, leads us to understand them as processes. If organisms are developmental cycles, then we should regard these developmental cycles, rather than the thing-like time slices that we abstract from them, as the actual entities that compose the evolutionary process. In fact, this is the view of evolution that developmental systems theorists have been advocating for many years, with the vital corollary that evolution can be driven by changes to any of the factors that contribute to reproducing the developmental cycle (see Griffiths and Gray 1994 and the chapter in this volume by Griffiths and Stotz). We have to be careful here, however, with the unusual grammar of the word 'evolve'. Although humans evolve, no particular human ever evolves. What evolves is populations. Even the concept of population is not quite appropriate, as it lacks temporal extension. Populations are temporal cross sections of lineages, so it really is the lineages that undergo evolutionary change. To say that humans evolve is to say that humans existing at one stage of the human lineage differ in some systematic way from those existing at an earlier stage. The evolving lineages generally considered to be the central subjects of evolutionary change are the entities we usually refer to as species.24 One of the earliest debates in modern philosophy of biology concerned the metaphysical status of species. Because species have historically been treated as paradigmatic classificatory concepts, they were long supposed to designate kinds. But then Michael Ghiselin (1974) and David Hull (1976, 1978) advanced the thesis 24 This is, again, not quite right, as species typically consist of a number of populations-they are often described as 'metapopulations'-that may not be connected to one another reproductively or otherwise. Consequently, the unit we really want as the locus of evolutionary change is that of which the metapopulation is a cross section, something for which, as far as we know, there is no standard term (unless, of course, we count 'species'!). For present purposes, we can overlook this complication. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  that species are not kinds but individuals. Although the species-as-individuals view has become widely accepted, it continues to encounter some resistance on the grounds that it is puzzling and counterintuitive. It is objected for example that, as the members of a species are discrete and relatively independent, it is not clear how they can be identified as parts of an individual. Another common complaint is that species have very fuzzy boundaries, whereas individuals typically do not. Interestingly, once we see species not just as individuals, but as individual processes, we are able to address both of these concerns. Causal relations between the temporal stages of a lineage, and between the spatial parts of these temporal stages, are responsible for providing that lineage with whatever integrity it has as an individual process. And the problem of vague boundaries turns out not to be a problem at all, as processes tend to lack clearly defined boundaries to begin with (think of the boundaries of a thunderstorm, for instance). The expectation that individuals should have clear boundaries is merely a prejudice of substance thought, which we bypass when we assume a process ontology. If species or lineages are individual processes, how do they manage to maintain their coherence and stability over time? It would seem that, just as organisms persist by renewing the cells that compose them through constant metabolic turnover, so lineages persist by replacing the organisms that make them up through continuous cycles of reproduction. Now recall that reproduction, properly understood, comprises not only inheritance processes (such as genetic replication) but also developmental ones; and these in turn draw on a highly heterogeneous range of causal factors (Oyama et al. 2001), which means that all of the latter contribute, too, to the stabilization of a lineage. In addition, a lineage persists by virtue of the reciprocal interactions that its members maintain with their environment. Members of a lineage not only adapt to their environment but also modify it, as a consequence of their activities and in accordance with their needs. This process is known as niche construction (Odling-Smee et al. 2003).25 Last but by no means least, the persistence of a lineage is dependent on natural selection, understood here not as a cause of change but as a stabilizing force. Stabilizing selection leads to the continued production of very similar phenotypes in a lineage (namely the most adaptive ones), and this helps maintain its stability over long periods of time. Of course, despite these numerous forms of stabilization, lineages do gradually change, and this results in their evolution. A key implication of the process perspective is that it encourages us to embrace a much more pluralistic understanding of evolutionary change than the one assumed by orthodox neo-Darwinism, which regards it almost exclusively in terms of natural selection acting on different alleles in a population. Selection cannot take place unless some other process has already provided the pertinent variants, and the modern synthesis assumption 25 It is important not to confuse niche construction with the notion of the extended phenotype (Dawkins 1982), as they imply opposite ontologies. The former can be seen as an implication of process ontology, whereas the latter is indicative of substance ontology. The extended phenotype extends the boundaries of things (i.e. organisms) beyond theirmaterial bodies and onto their environments, but these boundaries remain fully determined by the intrinsic properties of the things themselves. Niche construction, in contrast, suggests that organisms and their environments are causally intertwined and mutually constitute one another.

Lineages are sustained by a wide range of processes, such as reproduction, niche construction, and stabilizing selection, as we have already noted, but also including parental effects, conspecific interactions, and symbiotic associations. It is conceivable that changes in, or disruptions of, any of these stabilizing activities might affect the temporal trajectory of a lineage, and we should therefore consider including them in our explanations of evolutionary change.26 We offer one last and more speculative suggestion. Processual systems such as organisms and cells respond to their environment in ways that are conducive to their persistence. A growing number of theorists maintain that such responses are not merely automatic reactions elicited by environmental stimuli, but rather reflect purposive actions performed by organisms on their own behalf and prompted by emerging challenges and opportunities in the environment. It seems uncontentious to suggest that natural selection should favour organisms that do what is most conducive to their survival over those that produce fixed responses to a determinate range of environmental stimuli, though traditionally it was supposed that results of the former kind were achievable only through high degrees of intelligence. In her chapter, Flavia Fabris shows that Waddington believed that such adaptive strategies can be found much more widely (a view that Waddington shared with many of his organicist contemporaries), and that such systemic responses could be explained in terms of the adaptive deployment of hidden genetic variation. Perhaps, as Denis Walsh suggests in his provocative chapter, we should see evolutionary change as resulting primarily from such agent-like capacities of organisms and other processual systems. 7.4. Medicine The process perspective also has interesting consequences for medicine, specifically for how we think about the concept of disease, as has been recently argued by PierreOlivier Méthot and Samuel Alizon (2015).27 The history of medical thought reveals that the understanding of disease has oscillated back and forth between two opposing conceptions. According to the so-called physiological conception, diseases result from disturbances in the functional equilibrium of the body, and their cure reflects the harmonious restoration of this equilibrium. In contrast, the so-called ontological conception views diseases as foreign entities that enter the body, and their cure implies the expulsion of the intruders. The ontological conception is aligned with substance ontology, as it regards diseases as particular things (or properties of things) that are discrete and exist independently of the body they infect, whereas the physiological conception is more congenial to process ontology, as it views diseases 26 One of us has recently elaborated upon these claims in more detail elsewhere (Dupré 2017). 27 Pierre-Olivier Méthot participated in the workshop at the University of Exeter where many of the papers collected in this volume were first presented, but unfortunately was not able to contribute a chapter. The ensuing discussion considers some of the ideas he presented, many of which are featured in the aforementioned paper. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  as temporally extended disruptions in the carefully regulated meshwork of interconnected processes that constitutes the body. With the rise of medical microbiology in the late nineteenth century the ontological conception became the dominant theory of disease, and so it has remained, more or less, to the present day. The modern notion of a 'pathogen' is clearly derived from it, which accounts for why pathogens have long been considered a discrete category, distinguished from other microbes by their inherent capacity to cause disease in appropriate hosts. Conceiving of the biological realm in processual terms leads us to question the adequacy of such a strongly substantialist understanding of the aetiology of disease. Taking a processual stance today does not mean returning to the old physiological conception of disease. But it does suggest that pathogenicity may not be an intrinsic property of a microbe at all, but rather, as Méthot and Alizon (2015) argue, a contingent property afforded by the particular ecological context in which the microbe finds itself and by the complex and ever changing symbiotic relationship it maintains with its host. Remarkably, this is precisely the view that appears to be emerging from recent microbiological research. The traditional question 'Is this microbe a pathogen?' is gradually giving way to the question 'Under what ecological conditions is this microbe likely to become a pathogen?'. This shift is partly being prompted by the discovery that microbes thought to be engaged in commensal or mutualistic relations with their host can become pathogenic (i.e. parasitic) as a result of changes in the host environment (this is the case for the microbes that make up the normal microbiota of the human gut, for instance). Conversely, microbes that are usually pathogenic can end up protecting their host against more virulent parasites. Virulence itself, which refers to the degree of damage a pathogen is capable of inflicting on its host, is not a permanent property of the pathogen; it is arguably not even a property of the pathogen, but rather the outcome of a specific kind of interaction between the pathogen and its host. It is becoming increasingly clear that there is nothing about pathogens, as far as their structure is concerned, that fundamentally sets them apart from nonpathogens. There is also growing evidence that infections are frequently caused by more than one type of microbe. Viewing pathogenicity as a property of an individual microbe can therefore be misleading, as it is often a collective property that emerges from the interactions of various kinds of microbes with a host. In addition, it needs to be kept in mind that the microbes themselves are not unchanging things but are constantly evolving-and microbes can evolve very rapidly! Sometimes they evolve the capacity to be pathogens. Indeed, an infection that is initially harmless to one host can become pathogenic in subsequent infections.28 The above considerations strongly suggest that there are no definite criteria by which we can unequivocally classify a particular microbe as a pathogen. The more empirical research is conducted, the further away we seem to be from being able to make such classifications, and for good reason. Attempts to classify microbes in this 28 The potentially great rapidity of this process can be attributed to the lateral transfer of so-called virulence factors, which are often packaged as mobile genetic units, such as plasmids, that are transferable to other cells within the microbiome.

To attribute pathogenicity to an individual microbe is to commit an indefensible act of abstraction, as it implies ignoring the complex processual context that makes it possible. A microbe is not a thing or a substance, and pathogenicity is not an unchanging property that the microbe carries with it like an essence; it is rather a process, and as such it is to be expected that its characteristics will be found to be transient, contextdependent, historically contingent, and ever subject to ecological and evolutionary changes.29 8. Conclusions This essay has concerned itself with a number of issues pertaining to the metaphysics of science. It has shown, we hope, that these issues are of such fundamental importance that they cannot be avoided by anyone seriously concerned with science, be it through philosophical reflection or through empirical investigation. Scientists as well as philosophers are inevitably committed to certain metaphysical views, regardless of whether they are aware of them or not. These views, as Waddington recognized, 'are not mere epiphenomena, but have a definite and ascertainable influence on the work [a scientist] produces' (Waddington 1969: 72). We believe that being explicit about the metaphysical stance one takes to be right for biology is crucial if we are to prevent what Whitehead described as the 'canaliz[ation of] thought and observation within predetermined limits, based upon inadequate metaphysical assumptions dogmatically assumed' (Whitehead 1933: 151). Our aim in this essay has been to defend the metaphysical thesis that a process ontology is the right ontology for the living world. We are well aware that previous attempts to defend process ontology have often been met with considerable scepticism, if not downright hostility. One reason for this, in our view, is that process philosophers have frequently felt the need to introduce a new lexicon in order to come to terms with the processual nature of existence. Whitehead, of course, is the most notorious example, and his influence on modern process philosophy, including on how it is perceived by those who oppose it, has been enormous. However, as we hope this essay has demonstrated, it is not necessary to appeal to neologisms or resort to opaque prose to make the case for process. Thing-locutions, despite their pervasiveness, do not have to be taken at face value. After all, our linguistic conventions are not always aligned with our ontological convictions; which is why, for instance, we continue to speak of 'sunsets' and 'sunrises' even centuries after the Copernican revolution. It suffices that we realize that English grammar, like that of other Indo-European languages, exhibits a clear bias towards substances, which may well be rooted, at least in part, in our cognitive dispositions. 29 Further implications of process ontology for evolutionary microbiology are explored in Bapteste and Dupré 2013. OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi       .  Beyond any such inherent bias, we surmise that the widespread prevalence of substance ontology also reflects the fact that in many circumstances it does the job sufficiently well. The relation between substance and process ontology is not completely unlike the relation between classical and modern physics. Just as classical physics provides a convenient approximation of middle-sized physical entities moving at relatively slow speeds but does not constitute an accurate description of physical reality, so substance ontology provides a serviceable characterization of biological entities, especially when considered over short temporal intervals, despite being a fundamentally inappropriate description of the living world. But, although it might seem more intuitive to regard organisms as things than as processes, the situation quickly begins to reverse when we start giving due consideration to time. Many of the methods used to study living entities abstract away from the temporal dimension to facilitate their investigation-one only needs to think of conventional anatomical techniques such as desiccating, pickling, staining, fixing, and freezing. It may be that these methods have led biologists to think in substance terms, or perhaps these methods rather reflect their awareness of the difficulty of dealing adequately with dynamic material and therefore highlight their appreciation of the processual nature of life. Yet, even if the latter is the correct diagnosis, it seems to us that the reliance on such techniques has concealed the deficiencies of theorizing grounded in substance ontology (this claim is further developed by Laura Nuño de la Rosa in her chapter). Our argument in this essay has been that process ontology is far more concordant with the understanding of the living world provided by contemporary biology than its substantialist rival. The more we learn about life, the more necessary a process perspective becomes. This is particularly the case with regard to the increasing realization of the omnipresence of symbiosis, which directly challenges deeply entrenched substantialist assumptions about the living world. Thus the empirical findings of biology are inexorably driving us towards processualism, even if it is less intuitive than substantialism. It is interesting to observe that physics, which has traditionally been regarded as the more advanced science, was pushed towards process ontology about a century ago (as was argued by Whitehead and others), and now biology-if we and the other contributors to this volume are correct-is following suit. Might this perhaps be an indication that the shift from substantialism to processualism is just something that all sciences go through as they develop? This intriguing possibility was recently suggested by Mark Bickhard: Every science has progressed beyond an initial conception of its phenomena in substance terms to understanding that they are in fact process phenomena. Fire is no longer modeled in terms of the substance phlogiston, but instead in terms of the process of combustion; heat no longer in terms of caloric, but in terms of random kinetic processes; life no longer in terms of vital fluids, but in terms of special kinds of far from thermodynamic equilibrium processes. And so on. (Bickhard 2009: 553) Be that as it may, what is evident is that an ontology of processes is more consistent with the facts of biology than is an ontology of substances. Metabolic turnover, life cycles, and ecological interdependence-to mention the three phenomena we have discussed here in most detail-all provide compelling empirical motivations for OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, 5/5/2018, SPi          adopting a process ontology in biology. Philosophers sceptical of our naturalistic approach to metaphysics will doubt whether any amount of empirical evidence could settle, or even be relevant to, the debate between substantialism and processualism. To them, we can at least offer our arguments that processualism can deal more effectively than substantialism with a wide range of philosophical issues, including classification, individuation, persistence, explanation, and abstraction. And, for those who share our discomfort with the interconnected doctrines of essentialism, reductionism, and mechanicism, processualism supplies resources for grounding this discomfort-resources that, as we have seen, are not available to the substantialist. If the value of an ontological position is to be measured, at least in part, by the ability it gives us to solve problems, then processualism can draw support from its application both to biology and to philosophy. Finally, this essay has illustrated how a processual stance serves as an invaluable heuristic guide in scientific research. It has a number of interesting and sometimes unexpected consequences for fields as diverse as physiology, genetics, evolution, and medicine, where it forces us to question deeply engrained assumptions and to revise basic theoretical tenets. Processualism sheds new light on old problems and even encourages us to change our research questions, and it therefore has the potential to open up novel avenues of empirical investigation. After reading the rest of the essays collected in this volume, we hope that the reader will be convinced at least of the usefulness, and we hope even of the truthfulness, of a processual philosophy of biology. 9. Overview of Contributions Although we have already alluded to the seventeen other contributions to this volume, it might be useful to end by saying something about how the book as a whole is organized. After this extensive introduction, the chapters that follow are classified into four thematic clusters: 'Metaphysics', 'Organisms', 'Development and Evolution', and 'Implications and Applications'. The five chapters in Part II deal with general metaphysical issues related to the goal of developing a process ontology for biology. Peter Simons argues that a fundamentally processual understanding of the living world requires that we reconceptualize the continuant things that biologists study as secondary 'precipitates' of primary processes. Rani Lill Anjum and Stephen Mumford suggest that biology is better served by a dispositionalist theory of causation than by more traditional Humean accounts, given that only the former can do justice to the dynamicity, continuity, and context-sensitivity of biological phenomena. James DiFrisco attempts to strengthen the case for a process ontology in biology by providing causal-and suitably processual-accounts of individuation and persistence in terms of cohesion and genidentity respectively. Thomas Pradeu explores in more detail the fertility of the concept of genidentity in biology, showing how it leads us to prioritize processes over things. Finally, Johanna Seibt considers how a systematic ontological framework of subjectless processes she has developed over many years, called 'general process theory', can be used to address questions of individuality, composition, and emergence in the philosophy of biology.

Daniel Nicholson calls for a shift in how we think about what organisms are, replacing the conventional machine-like conception with a stream-like one that better captures their processual nature. Denis Walsh claims that recognizing the unique character of organisms as processual agents requires an agential theory to make sense of how they evolve. Frédéric Bouchard maintains that evolutionary individuality comes in degrees, as it reflects various levels of functional integration between intersecting processes. Finally, Argyris Arnellos proposes a process-based organizational ontology for biology in order to account for the integrity of individual organisms while simultaneously explaining their collaborative dimension. The four chapters in Part IV adopt a process ontology in the specific contexts of development and evolution. Paul Griffiths and Karola Stotz show that developmental systems theory is deeply committed to a processual view of life and offer a number of reasons why processes need to be taken as fundamental in both development and evolution. Flavia Fabris reappraises the core concepts of Waddington's theory of epigenetics and suggests that the genetic assimilation of acquired characters is best explained in processual terms. Laura Nuño de la Rosa looks at how new microscopy, molecular, and computer technologies for modelling biological processes are themselves contributing to a more processual understanding of development. Finally, Eric Bapteste and Gemma Anderson discuss how an increasing appreciation of the evolutionary role of intersecting biological processes requires new ways of representing these processes for analytical purposes. Lastly, the four chapters in Part V explore broader implications and applications of a processual philosophy of biology. Stephan Guttinger makes the case for a processual understanding of macromolecules, drawing on ecological ideas to argue that only a process view can elucidate their fundamentally relational character. Marta Bertolaso and John Dupré articulate a processual perspective on cancer, arguing that it reflects a failure in the highly complex regulatory system that stabilizes a multicellular organism over time. Ann-Sophie Barwich submits that a process perspective on perception- motivated by recent findings in cognitive neuroscience-results in a far more flexible and contextual understanding of olfaction than has been traditionally supposed. Finally, Anne Sophie Meincke defends the claim that the philosophical dilemma of personal identity can be overcome by conceiving of persons as biological processes. References Abir-Am, P. G. (1987).

In Part I there is an argument for the conclusion that a linguistic phenomenon known as (radical) ―context-sensitivity‖ is to be expected given the limitations of those who use language to reason about empirical states of affairs. The phenomenon arises as a consequence of a process that must be performed to use language to reason validly. In Part II it is explained why the phenomenon, understood in light of the discussion of Part I, does not threaten the possibility of communication. 4 Acknowledgements Charles Bukowski opens Post Office with the words, ―This book is presented as a work of fiction and is dedicated to nobody.‖ I used to like the thought of being able to say something just like that. As was inevitably going to be the case, I cannot say it here with any truth and because I now have a fairly good idea of just what would have to be so for it to be true, I don't even like the thought of it anymore. I'd like to thank those I've lived with over the past three years, my friends: MariaGuadalupe Alejandri, Mícheál de Barra, Aleks Gara, Su Herbst, Tommy Murphy, Maia Peck, and Jeremy Whitehurst. There have been so many occasions on which I would have lost my head were it not for these people keeping me grounded. I owe them a lot. Special thanks to Mícheál de Barra who has snapped me out of silliness many times with a good humour and patience. I have not taken this for granted. More recently, Maia Peck's companionship and bold kindness has kept me from turning in on myself and the books in a damaging way that I assuredly would have, had she not been around to stop it. My supervisors, Mark Textor and Charles Travis, have tended in opposite directions. My discussions with Charles provided an arena for slow and sympathetic discussion on the main ideas of the thesis. He offered a supervised freedom to attempt what I have attempted here. Mark has offered an equally encouraging but more critical voice that I think has helped curtail my more blinkered tendencies. I certainly feel like this combination is something from which I have benefited. I hope I have not let them down. When I first arrived at KCL I worked predominantly with Ruth Kempson. Her explosive energy and authentic interest in the ideas of her graduate students led to a fantastic working environment during that first year. She helped organise the reading group and subsequent workshop in which I met the guys over at Queen Mary's (Arash Eshghi, Pat Healey, Chris Howes, Greg Mills, and Graham White). Through them and through Ruth's own research I became aware of their investigations into the use of language in real conversations. It was through this also that I became aware of the work of Harvey Sacks and Erving Goffman. For the community and the intellectual ingredients, I owe her (and the others) a great deal. More generally, the environment in the department has been ideal. It has provided innumerable opportunities to experiment with new ideas with willing and critical others and to learn from the different approaches to philosophy taken by the 5 faculty there. The friendly atmosphere of the place is what makes it capable of fostering its diversity, not to mention the concomitant potential for intellectual cross-pollination; all this when it is just so easy for doors to be closed without any more explanation than a short-tempered and incredulous stare. It is a puzzle to me that it took more than 2,000 signatures and a forced embarrassing to get others in the university to value the place as highly as it ought. Several people have given me walls to run up against. They gave a red-blooded presence to problems I might otherwise have thought unimportant: Maria Alvarez, Lucy Campbell, Henry Clarke, Chris Jay, Nat Hansen, Jonny McIntosh, Tom Pink, Barry Smith, and Peter Sutton. No small thank you is due them. There is a circle of friends, mostly, though not all, graduate students at KCL, who have provided an at times daily mix of friendship and intellectual camaraderie: Solveig Aasen, Luke Brunning, Lucy Campbell, Michael Campbell, Kit Chiu, Jack Darach, Marion Godman, Eleni Gregoromichelaki, Ben Jeffery, Sam Kukathas, Ling Low, Rory O'Connell, Michael O'Sullivan', Peter Ridley, Kalbir Sohi, Peter Sutton, and Jen Wright. These people have provided the same support outside my home as my flatmates provided within it. Several of them read through chapters of this thesis (or their ancestors). For detailed comments and suggestions I want to thank: Solveig Aasen, Lucy Campbell, Rory O'Connell, Kalbir Sohi, and Peter Sutton. I would like to thank the Arts and Humanities Research Council for financial support in writing this thesis. You may think I'm kidding, but I would also like to thank my landlord, Max Nowaz, whose more than reasonable rent has helped me avoid financial trouble where I would otherwise have met it. Lastly, though it should go without saying, not least, I would like to thank my parents. Their love and support has stood fast through good and bad times. Parents are supposed to do that, some might think. But of course not all do. It's not something that just happens and certainly not without a lot of work from them who have their own lives to lead. I cannot thank them enough. 6 Contents Abstract ...................................................................................................... 3 Acknowledgements

The first describes a purpose of the contextsensitivity of linguistic expressions. The strategy taken is similar to the genealogical studies of Edward Craig and Bernard Williams.1 Although their studies introduce a historical narrative to achieve their effect, something from which I will refrain, they both also attempt to improve our understanding of their chosen phenomena by showing how things we might take for granted would malfunction if the pertinent phenomenon were absent. They thus show that such phenomena are not idle where otherwise that may have been the suspicion. It is in this sense that the investigation in the first part of this thesis is about the purpose of context-sensitivity and may be called  genealogical.' It is common to suppose that a main activity in which words are put to work is described by the ―simple model of communication.‖2 The model appears innocuous.3 There is a speaker and a hearer. The speaker produces a sentence. The hearer and the speaker associate the same worldly conditions with the sentence. If the speaker is being honest and competent then the hearer can learn how things are with 1 See (Craig 1990) on knowledge and (Williams 2004) on telling the truth. 2 For example: (Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet 1990, pp.11-14), (Cruse 2004, pp.5-6), (Larson and Segal 1995, p.6), (Lyons 1977, pp.32-43), (Portner 2005, pp.20-22), and (Predelli 2010, p.329) 3 I do not mean to launch an attack on a ―code model‖ of communication as do (Sperber and Wilson 1986). The simple model is more general than the code model they attack and arguably encompasses the inferential model they prefer. Whether or not there is a one-toone relation between sentences and truth-conditions is not what is important about the simple model. Rather, our focus is the contrast the model elicits between on the one hand, unsystematic contextual variation in what is to be understood by spoken words, and on the other hand, the form, meaning, and syntax of words. The latter clearly do work we would be worse off without but the former does not appear to do so. 11 something not then perceptible by him by means of something that is then perceptible by him. Finally, sentences are constituted out of finite elements combined in accordance with rules. If we grant that this model has application to our use of sentences then we can easily see the utility in three features of them. Firstly, the sentences are useless in this model if they are not perceptible. So their having a phonological or graphological form serves a purpose. If they were unobservable thoughts or ―abstracta‖ then they would not be suited for the activity taking place in the model. Secondly, the sentences have something about them which enables interlocutors to recognise what is the case given their (honest, competent) production. We could call this ―meaning.‖ Without that, although an expression may be perceptible, given that a sentence does not mean anything in itself, the activity represented in the model could not take place by means of the production and observation of them. Thirdly, because the sentences are constituted out of a finite number of simpler elements combined in accordance with rules, it is possible to learn how to produce and understand an infinite number of sentences.4 This enables the activity of the model to allow a greater deal of diversity in what can be communicated of than would otherwise be possible. Unlike the form of a sentence, its meaning, and the syntactic rules to which its elements conform, that there is indefinitely many different things that could be said to be so by means of a sentence seems to contribute nothing positive to the activity described by the model.5 In fact, quite the opposite: it appears to undermine the elegant work contributed by the other features we know sentences to possess. It introduces a lacuna in the model where we should have found an explanation of how a hearer can form a particular expectation of how the world is given the presentation of a given sentence. 4 (Davidson 1965 [1984]) 5 Some (e.g. (Stanley 2007, p.17)) have proposed that the utility in context-sensitivity is economy: sentences would have to be longer than is practical if only features of linguistic expressions determined what would, for instance, make true a given sentence. However, this view is warranted only for what I will call below ―further factor views.‖ If one denies that there is any regularity in what is relevant to what would make true a given sentence, then reliance upon features of a speaking beyond the expressions employed is just as useless as would be a simpler view. I think Stanley recognises this and that is why he intends to supply a possible purpose for context-sensitivity understood as a further factor view only. 12 It is because the model, and the lacuna generated within it by a radical contextualism, loom large in the credibility of the claim that there are no systematic relationships between sentences and truth-conditions (predicates and satisfiers, referring NPs and referents) that I am approaching the topic  genealogically.' To show empirically that the phenomenon is pervasive only serves to heighten anxiety if it is not shown why context-sensitivity does not form a spanner in the works without which the works would work perfectly well. By offering a genealogical account of context-sensitivity I hope to contribute in some way to fixing context-sensitivity a place of equal stature alongside the more obviously purposive features of linguistic expressions. Adopting this ―genealogical‖ strategy might be summarily dismissed. It has become common to study context-sensitivity with a methodology characteristic of formal semantics. Models of sentences are proposed. These models generate predictions about what properties a sentence has under different conditions that are also part of the model. These predictions are then tested against the intuition of native speakers of the sentences. There is nothing wrong, I think, with this methodology. It uncovers features of natural language insofar as the models found have application. But in denying the relevance to discussion (of context-sensitivity) of considerations other than those that take the form of a formal semantic analysis of a sentence, one is doing more than agreeing with the view that this methodology bears fruit. One is saying that it is the only respectable way to do any harvesting whatsoever. To this I have two things to say before we begin. Firstly, what is at issue is how to interpret the results of formal semantic study. So further engagement in that formal semantic study, which I am supposing, involves no study of that formal semantic study, will leave unanswered questions raised about the kinds of results formal semantic study generates. Secondly, if reasons could be found to think that the results of formal semantic study ought to be interpreted in such a way that a radical context-sensitivity is not in play, then you do not (automatically) override reasons for a radical contextualism. If you find such a combination of reasons, you generate a puzzle. So even if one could uncover phenomena of language which imply the falsity of the view to be defended, that would not show that or how the argument I am going to offer is unsound. It would generate a question but not necessarily an answer. 13 The second part of this thesis addresses what will still be a lingering concern. The purpose I find for context-sensitivity is (in the first instance) for expressions employed in reasoning. It does not in itself show why communication, understood along the lines of the simple model, is not undermined by a contextualism of the order I am attempting to defend. So in the second part I identify an argument for the incompatability of such a position and the possibility of communication which underlies the thinking of those with the doubts. I then attack a premise employed in that argument. The premise is attacked primarily by appeal to an understanding of context-sensitivity made possible by the purpose we will have found for it in the first part; but appeal will also be made to observations about the micro-sociology of conversation. 14 PART I 15 C H A P T E R I A hypothesis 1 Introduction The main concern of this thesis is to show that there is good reason to accept a brand of context-sensitivity which has been much discussed by Charles Travis: occasion-sensitivity (OS).6 I have found that Travis' own specifications of the thesis are equivocal when viewed in an environment filled with proposals similar in appearance. For this reason, this first chapter takes up the task of stating the view in such a way that it is clearly distinguishable from those similar looking alternatives. The discussion will make plain what is at issue and what is not. There have been mistakes made about this and I want to put us in a position to recognise these mistakes as such. We will not be at all concerned in the present chapter with arguments for the view. Our first step will be to introduce a series of distinctions. To illustrate their fogclearing potential, and to help us relate OS to other positions, I will examine the purported difference between semantic minimalism and radical contextualism 6 Because it is laid out slowly in stages for both referring expressions and predicative expressions, I think the clearest statement of the view is (Travis 1981). However, at that time the phenomenon was still interpreted as a case of radical ―ambiguity‖, as is obvious in Travis' continued commitment to a generative theory of illocutions, as described in (Travis 1975, Chapter 1). An ―illocution‖ is how a linguistic expression is to be understood (the ―to be‖ indicates how it ought to be understood, and not just how it could be understood). A generative theory of illocutions is modelled on a generative theory of syntax. The theory would consist of principles from which all and only the things there are to be understood can be derived. Travis (1986) gives up on this project. Travis (2006, Chapter 1) includes a good statement of the view: it is more general than (Travis 1981) but requires more work from the reader. Commonly cited in discussion of Travis' work are (Travis 1985) and (Travis 1997 [2008]). But as we will see, those more commonly cited statements are equivocal and easily confused with what I will later call a ―further factor view.‖ 16 under their light. They allow us to see that there is no real difference between these positions. I then state a hypothesis and I will define OS as the rejection of this hypothesis. This hypothesis is perhaps most prominently held by the early Donald Davidson and by David Lewis.7 The hypothesis can at this stage be roughly stated as: speakers of a language share a disposition to classify items as falling within the extension of given expressions and others as not. That is something you learn when you learn a language.8 It is hard to deny, and there is little reason to want to deny, that, in some sense, we acquire some dispositions when we come to speak a language. But exactly what dispositions these are is our topic. Having introduced the hypothesis I explain how Travis' own statements of OS are equivocal when viewed in the context of surrounding literature but when examined with sufficient care, are assuredly statements of OS as it is defined in this chapter. The final sections explain how the current account of OS is consistent with Travis' explicit distinction between his own view and the later Davidson's view, how OS is not incompatible with compositional semantics, and how OS should be distinguished from views from which it is typically not adequately distinguished. 2 Three distinctions 2.1 Linguistic expressions: types and instances There are sounds and marks we can make. Some of these have a form which makes them part of something recognisable as English or Mandarin etc. Different sounds and marks can share the same form. In this way the same expression can be produced repeatedly: red, red, red...There can be many instances of the same expression type.9 There are properties that instances of expression types share 7 Early Davidson because eventually he comes to say, ―I conclude that there is no such thing as a language, not if a language is anything like what many philosophers and linguists have supposed. There is therefore no such thing to be learned, mastered, or born with. We must give up the idea of a clearly defined shared structure which language-users acquire and then apply to cases. And we should try again to say how convention in any important sense is involved in language; or, as I think, we should give up the attempt to illuminate how we communicate by appeal to conventions.‖ (Davidson 1986, p.446). There is room for different readings of the later Davidson. But on some readings he is stating a view which I think can be classified as a kind of OS. Statements which presuppose the hypothesis can however be found in the earlier Davidson. As for Lewis, I mean his (1969), (1970), and (1973 [1983]). 8 For predecessors see also (Bloomfield 1933 [1979]) and (Quine 1960). 9 The full version of occasion-sensitivity ought to allow for instancing of expressions other than their production. For example, write out a note (one production), but then use the note for different purposes (many instances). The note as used for those different purposes could 17 quite robustly (perhaps even by definition). For instance: proper spelling, proper pronunciation, and perhaps syntactic category.10 But there are other properties of instances of expression types which are less robust. For instance, many instances of the English word ―red‖ have colours. But the instances of the word have different colours. There is not a regularity to be found in the colours of the words produced; at least, not simply by virtue of the fact that they are instances of the word. 2.2 Kind of regularity: long versus transient There is a sliding scale of longevities for which a type of expression when instanced will have a given property. It ranges from the very long (all the instances of an expression in the lifetime of a speaker) to the very short (a single instance). Some longevities are more interesting than others. I want to focus on one in particular. Suppose I say that Frank speaks a language. That is a claim made using a verb with habitual aspect: speaks. The simple present tense in English is generally used to make a claim with a verb with habitual aspect. Comrie identifies the following as a feature of habitual aspect: ...they describe a situation which is characteristic of an extended period of time, so extended in fact that the situation referred to is viewed not as an incidental property of the moment but, precisely as a characteristic feature of a whole period. (Comrie 1976, pp.27-28) Other examples include: Ralph kills ponies; blackcaps emigrate south; a shark lives in the ocean; seafood tastes salty; the bishop stands on that square; Max walks past the roundabout; Mylene attends parole meetings. Notice the feature that Comrie remarks upon: the ―extended period of time.‖ When it is over it is then the case that something used to φ, but does not any longer. Similarly, prior to a point in time at which it is true to say, for instance, Ralph kills ponies, it can be said that he will do so, or will start doing so, or will start to do so. There are edges to the period of time for which it is true to say that, for instance, Ralph kills ponies. Notice further that there can be variations in this extended period of time. It's not as though when habitual aspect is used there is one period of time one is committed vary in the properties with which we will be concerned below even though there is only one production of it. The discussion in this thesis will be limited to instances qua productions of expressions. But I am supposing that the discussion and its conclusions can be reapplied to these other ways of being instanced. 10 The list is not meant as exhaustive. 18 to something's being so for e.g. 22 minutes. If one attends parole meetings, this routine will end at a certain point, viz. when one is no longer on parole. Then one can truly say one used to attend parole meetings, but not anymore. If one walks past the roundabout on one's way to work, that might change if one changes the route one takes to work or changes jobs. Speaking a language is something that has a typical length too. If someone uses the language on a daily basis (i.e. does not fall out of practice), then it is true to say that she speaks, e.g. French, until she suffers a physically incapacitating accident, dementia, or death. Such a period of time typically exceeds the length of time for which one might be on parole or the length of time for which one has a given job which requires walking a certain route, and so on. Things could have been otherwise. But this is how they are with being such that one speaks a language.11 So now we have a certain longevity for which we can ask, do all the instances of an expression type have a property for that length of time? Let us call a property and expression that recur together with this longevity a long regularity or a property of the expression which has a long longevity. An expression and a property which recur together for a far shorter length of time (e.g. the length of a conversation) we will call a transient regularity or a property which has a transient longevity. You may be wondering why I approached this distinction through grammatical aspect. The reason is that statements are made about linguistic expressions and the properties they possess. We say that something satisfies a predicate or that a linguistic expression refers to some object. The italicised verbs have habitual aspect. But the longevity of the habit is most often not discussed. It is left in the background. In that way statements of this sort do not make explicit what it is that I want to discuss. So I have introduced this first distinction of kinds of regularity through the element of language that easily hides the different positions one could adopt on this issue. 11 One can use the word ―speaks‖ to speak of other things too. For instance, perhaps there is a play to be put on. Each night the actors switch roles. The roles are identified only by the languages spoken. Then someone might say, ―Jones speaks Latin, you speak Portuguese‖ meaning to speak of the time for which the play is being performed tonight only. But our discussion is about one ability in particular. This is an ability we know takes a long time to come to have and which stays with one for a long time if one keeps it practiced. 19 2.3 Kind of regularity: substantial versus logico-syntactic There are properties of linguistic expressions which we can describe as their extensions: for a referring NP, a referent; for a predicate, its satisfiers; and for a sentence, its truth-value. These properties are interlinked and can be used to describe a truth-condition of a sentence. There are two different things one might mean in speaking of a truth-condition of a sentence (and related notions: referents and satisfiers). To explain this difference I will need to introduce us to formal semantics. For it is a difference in how one goes about the empirical inquiry of formal semantics that makes for the difference between the two things one might mean by ―truth-condition.‖12 We will also need a toy formal semantics for the purposes of forthcoming discussion. I will sketch one now. 2.3.1 Formal semantics Formal semantics is formal because it concerns the form of linguistic expressions. Formal semantics is semantics because it concerns patterns in some of the properties that expressions, individuated by form, can have; properties which might be called ―semantic.‖ The aim of the empirical discipline of formal semantics is to identify patterns in the properties of linguistic expressions as employed by particular populations of speakers. A formal semantics is a system of rules that describes properties of expressions and allows one to predict how these properties change with respect to one another. We do not need to attend to the complexities that are the daily work of professional semanticists. What we do need is a formal semantics that can be applied to some English expressions and which allows us to illustrate claims made by myself and in the literatures that we will be concerned to address. A formal semantics can be divided into two parts: the syntactic part and the semantic part. The syntax describes what expressions are in question. Importantly this includes what complex expressions are in question: expressions formed by concatenation with other expressions. The semantic part is defined for given expressions relative to their syntactic categories. It describes what the properties of expressions can be, given the properties of other expressions. 12 I am not claiming that these are the only two things one can speak of with the expression ―truth-condition.‖ 20 2.3.1.1 Syntax We will employ a simple phrase structure grammar. To apply this to our expressions we need to divide the expressions into (syntactic) categories. This will be done by writing out rules. Some of these rules describe how the expressions can be combined given their category. The complex expressions will themselves be members of syntactic categories. We can distinguish between basic and non-basic syntactic categories. The first set of rules (a)-(i) describe how complex expressions can be formed out of simpler expressions and therefore define the non-basic categories: a. SNP Pred b. S S conj S c. S neg S d. S If S then S e. VP Vt N f. VP Vi g. PredINFL VP h. NPN i. NPDet nom There will be an inflection on verbs which in the semantics will be associated with temporal and modal information: j. INFL(neg) PAST 3rd SNG PRES FUT M There are two rules which allow movement of syntactic elements. Firstly, there is movement of NPs. When NPs are moved they leave traces (variables), ei: 21 k. [s X NP Y]  [s NPi [s X ei Y]] (Quantifier raising) Secondly, there is movement of the inflection element of a verb: l. [s NP INFL X]  [s INFL [s NP X]] (Inflection raising) Both rules allow us to use modal predicate logic in providing a formal semantic analysis of (some) natural language sentences. For expressions that will figure within the recursive semantic rules below and will not be treated by a valuation function we have special syntactic rules. There are: m. conjand, or n. Detthe, a, every o. negit is not the case that p. Mmight, can, must Finally, we need to assign our linguistic expressions to the basic syntactic categories. So some linguistic expressions will be assigned to the category NP, some to VP, and so on. Such a thing looks like this: N Syverten, Durden, Cotter. Vi died, smiled, ate, slept. Vt murdered, betrayed. 2.3.1.2 Semantics Properties are assigned to the expressions, basic and complex, using a further set of rules. As with the syntactic rules, these divide into those that concern complex and those that concern basic expressions. Some of these rules are defined not in terms of the expressions themselves, but in terms of the syntactic categories to which expressions are allocated. Others (found in what is called ―the model‖) are defined for particular expressions. Together these rules define a function I()M,w,i,c,g known as the interpretation function. 2.3.1.2.1 The interpretation function The arguments to the function are: an expression, a model M, a world w, a time i, a context c, and an assignment function g. The expression is self-explanatory. The 22 assignment function, g, is a function that assigns elements of the domain of the model M to variables rather than non-logical constants. The model M defines sets from which w, i, and c are drawn. The model also assigns intensions or extensions to the non-logical basic constants. A model is itself an ordered tuple: <D, W, I, C, F>. D is a domain of items the expressions will be usable to speak of. W is a set of worlds. I is a set of times whose members are ordered in a linear sequence. But care should be taken in how these are to be understood so please try not to read them too literally. Just think of them as sets with elements within them. F assigns intensions (or extensions) to the expressions that are constants. An intension is a function from parameters to elements of the domain D. The parameters will be worlds and times. F assigns different kinds of intension to expressions of different syntactic categories. If β is a proper name, then F(β) is a function from elements of W and elements of I to elements of D. If β is a predicate, then F(β) is a function from elements of W and elements of I to sets of elements of D. If β is a transitive verb then F(β) is a function from elements of W and elements of I to sets of ordered pairs of elements of D. For some expressions their intension will include a further parameter whose domain is not W and I, viz. a parameter with a domain whose elements are drawn from C (the remaining element of the tuple that is the model: <D, W, I, C, F>). The parameter is the context parameter, c, of an intension. The context parameter of an intension is redundant except for a certain class of expressions. Which expressions are they? If I walk over to Regents Park and utter the expression, ―No one is here‖, then the expression ―here‖ can be modelled as having as its element from the domain, Regent's Park. But if one were to walk over to Hyde Park and produce the expression, then it would better be modelled as having its element from the domain as, Hyde Park. There is this variation, even though the two occurrences of ―here‖ could occur with respect to the same world and the same time (two different people utter the sentence, ―No one is here,‖ in the two different places simultaneously). This feature of ―here‖ is thought to contrast with for instance, ―Hyde Park‖, which does not vary in this way with the circumstances in which it is produced. So rather than having an element of a domain assigned to the expression, ―here‖, tout court F assigns to that expression an element of the domain relative to c. A context is something relative to which the item from the domain that is assigned to ―here‖ is defined. However, words other than ―here‖ exhibit the same behaviour e.g. ―this‖, 23 ―that‖, ―I‖, ―she‖, ―you‖, and more. But each expression depends upon the circumstances of its production in different ways (if they were not then one could not say truly, ―That is not here.‖). So the way each expression has an element of the domain assigned to it will need to be different. A context is an n-tuple. The tuple is as long as are the number of different kinds of expression which operate in this manner. We can name each element in the tuple: e.g. location, speaker, addressee etc. We can then speak of the location of c, or the speaker of c. The valuation function for these expressions will then operate like so: F(here)(c) = the location of (c) There is no relativisation to worlds and times because these expressions are rigid designators. These expressions are usually called indexicals (e.g. ―I‖, ―you‖, ―he‖, ―she‖) and demonstratives (e.g. ―that‖, ―those‖). There is a question of how the value of this parameter (just as there is for the other two: world and time) is to be determined. On this issue the formal semantics stays silent. The logical constants are not assigned elements of D and what they are assigned is not assigned by a model. They are expressions whose intensions do not vary in their values relative to different values of w, i, and c, so those parameters need not feature in their definition. They can be defined as follows: F(and) = <1,1>1 <1,0>0 <0,1>0 <0,0>0 F(or) = <1,1>1 <1,0>1 <0,1>1 <0,0>0 24 F(If...then...) = <1,1>1 <1,0>0 <0,1>1 <0,0>1 F(not) = 10 01 2.3.1.2.2 Recursive semantic rules The recursive semantic rules can then be defined as follows: a. If β is a trace then I(β)M,w,i,c,g = g(β). Otherwise I(β)M,w,i,c,g = F(β)(w,i) unless β is an indexical or demonstrative in which case, I(β)M,w,i,c,g = F(β)(c). b. If A and B are any categories, I([A B])M,w,i,c,g = I(B)M,w,i,c,g c. I([s NP Pred])M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff I(NP)M,w,i,c,g  I(Pred)M,w,i,c,g and 0 otherwise. d. I([s S1 conj S2])M,w,i,c,g = I(conj)M,w,i,c,g (<I(S1)M,w,i,c,g, I(S2)M,w,i,c,g >) e. I([s If S1 then S2])M,w,i,c,g = I(If...then...)M,w,i,c,g (<I(S1)M,w,i,c,g, I(S2)M,w,i,c,g >) f. I([s neg S])M,w,i,c,g = I(neg)M,w,i,c,g (I(S)M,w,i,c,g) g. I([VP Vt NP])M,w,i,c,g = {x: <x, I(NP)M,w,i c,g >  I(Vt)M,w,i,c,g } There are then rules for the semantics of expressions that include variables and quantifiers: h. I([[every β]i S])M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff for all u  D, if u  I(β)M,w,i,c,g then I(S)M,w,i,c,g[u/ei] = 1 i. I([[a β]i S)M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff for some u  D, u  I(β)M,w,i,c,g and I(S)M,w,i,c,g[u/ei] = 1 25 j. I([[the β]i S)M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff for some u  D, I(β)M,w,i,c,g = u and I(S)M,w,i,c,g[u/ei] = 1 There are rules which would employ the additional parameters, w and i. But our interest in these parameters lies in how they are used to model context-sensitivity. So we do not need to introduce additional rules for modal expressions. But we are interested in tense. So we will need some semantic rules that use the tense information in the verb: k. I([[INFL PRES] S])M,w,i,c,g = I(S)M,w,i,c,g l. I([[INFL PAST] S])M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff where i′  I and there is some i′<i such that I(S) M,w,i′,c,g = 1 m. I([[INFL FUT] S])M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff where i′  I and there is some i′>i such that I(S) M,w,i′,c,g = 1 Notice that in these rules the value of i is determined by the circumstances of speaking. It is not invariant across all productions of an expression governed by this rule (mutatis mutandis the value of w). 2.3.1.2.3 Models Provided we have some expressions which we have assigned to basic syntactic categories, we can then provide a model, in the sense defined a moment ago, for those expressions. A model, recall, is an ordered tuple consisting of: D (a domain of objects), W (a set of worlds), I (a set of times), C (a set of contexts), and F (a valuation function). The valuation function assigns intensions to expressions. Let us illustrate with a model (M1) for two words: ―sleeps‖ and ―Ralph.‖ Suppose that ―sleeps‖ is assigned to the basic syntactic category of Vi. Expressions of that syntactic category are assigned sets of elements of the domain D. Suppose D consists of the set {a, b, c}. Ignore C. We can represent the intension assigned to ―sleeps‖ in M1 like so: 26 F(sleeps)(wn, in) = i1 i2 i3 w1 {a, b} {a,b} {} w2 {a} {a} {} w3 {b} {b} {} So, for instance, F(sleeps)(<w2,i3>) = {} but F(sleeps)(<w2,i1>)=a. Now let us take a second expression, ―Ralph.‖ Let us assign this to the basic syntactic category N, proper names. Proper names are assigned single elements of the domain D and what is more, they are assigned the same element for all w and all i. So, let us say that in M1 F(Ralph)(<wn,in>) = a for all w and all i. We can then use the recursive syntactic rules to form a sentence. By syntactic rule (f) an expression that is an intransitive verb is a verb phrase. By syntactic rule (g) a VP with an inflection is a predicate (the verb phrase ―sleeps‖ having present tense). By syntactic rule (h) a name is a noun phrase and by syntactic rule (a) a noun phrase concatenated with a predicate is a sentence. By syntactic rule (l), we raise the INFL to get another sentence. Hence [S [INFL PRES] [S [NP Ralph] [Pred sleeps]]] is a syntactic analysis of ―Ralph sleeps.‖ We can then use the semantic rules to provide an interpretation of this expression relative to different parameter values in M1. By semantic rule (k) I([S [INFL PRES] [S [NP Ralph] [Pred sleeps]]])M1,w,i,c,g = I([S [NP Ralph] [Pred sleeps]])M1,w,i,c,g By semantic rule (c), I([S [NP Ralph] [Pred sleeps]])M1,w,i,c,g = 1 iff I([NP Ralph])M1,w,i,c,g  I([Pred sleeps])M1,w,i,c,g. So now let us select some values for our parameters w=w1 and i=i3. By semantic rule (b) I([NP Ralph])M1, w1, i3, c, g = I(Ralph)M1, w1, i3, c, g and I([Pred sleeps])M1,w1,i3,c,g = I(sleeps)M1,w1,i3,c,g. And by semantic rule (a), I(Ralph)M1,w1,i3,c,g = F(Ralph)(<w1,i3>) = a and I(sleeps)M1,w1,i3,c,g = F(sleeps)(<w1,i3>) = {}. So, I([NP Ralph])M1,w1,i3,c,g  I([Pred sleeps])M1,w1,i3,c,g. Hence, I([S [INFL PRES] [S [NP Ralph] [Pred sleeps]]])M1,w1,i3,c,g = 0. 2.3.1.3 Logic With the syntax and semantics thus stated we can define the logical notions truth and entailment. I mention, because it is relevant for these definitions, that 27 syntactic rules (k) and (l) allow one and the same sentence to be assigned different syntactic structures: we say they have different logical forms (LFs). With that, we can define truth and entailment as follows: Truth: A sentence S is true in a model M, a world w, a time i, an LF β, and a context c, iff for every assignment g, I(β)M,w,i,c,g = 1. It is false if for every g, I(β)M,w,i,c,g = 0. Entailment: A sentence S relative to an LF α entails a sentence S′ relative to an LF β for every model M = <D, W, I, C, F>, if S is true in M relative to α, w, i, and c, then S′ is true in M relative to β, w, i, and c. 2.3.2 Stipulated and empirically born models A model for some expressions assigns those expressions extensions or intensions. The elements of the model together form a structure. For each tuple of elements from W, I and C we will have a collection of elements of D which fall into a structure of sets and subsets, as described by F. For instance, earlier we had such a thing for ―Ralph‖ and for ―sleeps.‖ For ―Ralph‖ we had: F(Ralph) = i1 i2 i3 w1 {a} {a} {a} w2 {a} {a} {a} w3 {a} {a} {a} And for ―sleeps‖ we had: F(sleeps) = i1 i2 i3 w1 {a, b} {a,b} {} w2 {a} {a} {} w3 {b} {b} {} 28 So the elements of D that are the extension of ―Ralph‖ form a subset of the elements of D that are the extension of ―sleeps‖ in <w1,i1>, <w2, i1>, <w1, i2>, and <w2, i2>, but not in <w3,i1>, <w3,i2>, <w3, i3>, <w1, i3>, or <w2, i3>. On its own, all that a model is is a series of structures of elements and sets, relativised to tuples, themselves drawn from the sets W, I, and C. When we describe a model we can stipulate various properties of the expressions to which the formal semantics is applied. Not only do we stipulate properties of proper names, predicates, and other basic expressions, viz. their extension or intension. We also stipulate the truth-values and truth-conditions of complex sentential expressions, albeit indirectly via the recursive rules of the formal semantics. Our stipulations are constrained only by the syntactic category of an expression. If, when pursuing the study of the formal semantics of expressions, it is not a problem that the models we produce are stipulated just so long as the stipulations conform to the constraints on the semantic values possible for an expression given its syntactic category, then what is being studied is not the particular semantic values of the expressions, but rather, the kind of semantic value, or equivalently, the semantic category of the expression. Consider, for instance, a linguistic expression, like, ―Ralph.‖ We can distinguish between kinds of semantic value and particular semantic values which that expression might have or be assigned. The semantic value of a (i.e. any) name is, we might say, an element of the domain D, or, alternatively, we might say it is an intension that maps the same element of the domain D for any pair <w,i>. ―Ralph‖ is a name, so any conclusions we come to about names would apply to it. In making such a claim we make no commitment about the particular semantic value of a particular name, e.g. that ―Eric Dolphy‖ is the name that refers to a man who died tragically in Berlin. That is the import of the fact that the model here was stipulated. If it is OK to stipulate models, then one is not aiming to study the particular intensions or extensions of expressions. One is only attempting to study their behaviour with respect to certain properties given their syntactic category. But things could be otherwise. An alternative would be that the models produced ought not to be stipulated but instead arise as the product of an empirical procedure wherein one observes the uses speakers make of expressions and one 29 attempts to document what items in the world are counted as the extension of the expressions. One then attempts to construct a description of the expressionextension relations one observes to obtain in the speakers' use of those expressions. A model acts as a description of the particular semantic value that an expression really has as employed by its speakers. Here then the model will not be stipulated but instead will be born of empirical inquiry. 2.3.3 Logico-syntactic versus substantial extensions We can now distinguish between two things one might mean in speaking of the truth-conditions of a sentence.13 When one states a truth-condition of a sentence, one employs something like one of the recursive semantic rules of a formal semantics. Consider again the semantic rule (c): c) I([s NP Pred])M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff I(NP)M,w,i,c,g  I(Pred)M,w,i,c,g and 0 otherwise. This rule states a schema for a truth-condition for a sentence of a given syntactic structure, viz. [NP][Pred]. One might fill in this schema with a particular sentence, ignoring tense, for instance: cʹ) I([s [NP Ralph] [Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff I([NP Ralph])M,w,i,c,g  I([Pred sleeps])M,w,i,c,g and 0 otherwise. This might be written out much less formally as: cʹʹ) ―Ralph sleeps‖ is true iff Ralph sleeps Now, (c′) and (c′′) might be called statements of the truth-condition(s) of the sentence ―Ralph sleeps.‖ But there are two things one might mean by this. Firstly, one might mean to say that (c′) states the truth-condition of the sentence even though insofar as one has supplied a model, say M1, for the formal semantics within which (c′) is stated (and one may well not have done so), one has stipulated it. Indeed, that is what we did. There is no pretence in M1 of an attempt to document how the words ―Ralph‖ and ―sleeps‖ are actually used by speakers of English, other than so far as their syntactic category is concerned. Secondly, however, one might actually have produced a model born of empirical investigation. Just as one may have constructed the semantic rules (a)-(m) by careful examination of how speakers use linguistic expressions of different syntactic 13 See (Barba 2007) for a similar distinction made for similar reasons to my own. 30 categories and documented what properties they assign to these expressions, so one might have gone further than that and set out to examine exactly what speakers of a language will count as the referents and satisfiers of various expressions and documented this in a model (perhaps even in a special technical language with which one described the elements of D, W, I, and C). In what sense one will be stating the truth-condition of ―Ralph sleeps‖ differs depending upon whether there is such a model and how that model was generated. If the statement of the truthcondition(s) of ―Ralph sleeps‖ that we find in (c′) and (c′′) is such that there is either no model for the formal semantics or a model is only stipulated, then, we will say that the truth-condition is logico-syntactic. What I intend to capture with this locution is that all one would really be describing with (c′) are constraints on possible distributions of extensions and intensions across the linguistic expressions making up the sentence given their syntactic categories. On the other hand, if the formal semantics within which (c′) is stated has a model which is born of (accurate) empirical inquiry, then we will say that the truth-condition it provides is substantial. For then one is claiming to specify exactly what speakers of the language will count as making the sentence true (and indeed, what they will count as referents of ―Ralph‖ and satisfiers of ―sleeps‖). One could make predictions with such a theory about such matters. Analogous distinctions between the substantial and the logico-syntactic can be drawn for the extensions of NPs and predicates. Typically, the kind of thesis put forward by those who pursue formal semantics makes no commitment of the second, substantial, sort.14 Suppose someone proposes a semantic analysis of the sentences such that that a given sentence entails the other is a consequence of the analysis. If it turns out that speakers can (rightly) classify one as true and the other false, then the hypothesis is incorrect. For example, the syntactic and semantic rules for the quantifiers are motivated by the fact that the English sentence, ―Every man missed some woman‖ can be read in two different ways such that in one case it entails the sentence, ―there is a woman whom every man missed‖ and in the other case it does not entail this sentence.15 Another example is the rules proposed in a formal semantics for modal expressions 14 E.g. Thomason (1974, p.48) is entirely explicit about this and even warns of the problems that arise from failing to recognise the distinction I have drawn between substantial and logico-syntactic truth-conditions. Though for all that Thomason still supposes the hypothesis I will define below. 15 (Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet 1990, 114-123) 31 like ―must‖ and ―might.‖ These are motivated in part by the fact that ―It might be the case that it is raining‖ does not entail ―It is raining‖ nor does it entail ―It is not raining.‖ That is, modal semantics is motivated in part by the fact the truth-values of sentences that include modal operators in natural language like ―It might be the case that‖ are not functions of the truth-value of the sentence the operator is appended to. These might be quite robust features of speakers' use of these expressions and the properties they ascribe to and withhold from them. These are logico-syntactic regularities which can be documented in a theory of the form of a formal semantics. But there are equivocal claims made about what exactly the formal semantic project is. For instance, Dowty et al. write: We merely wish to emphasize that truth-conditional semantics, in contrast to the other approaches mentioned, is based squarely on the assumption that the proper business of semantics is to specify how language connects with the world – in other words, to explicate the inherent ―aboutness‖ of language. Let us inject a little concreteness into this rather abstract discussion by taking a particular example. Consider the utterance: ―The Washington Monument is west of the Capitol Building.‖ What would a truth-conditional account of the meaning of this sentence be like? We have said that we will consider ourselves successful in producing such a meaning once we have specified what the world would have to be like in order for the sentence to be true. What condition of the world, what state-of-affairs would this be? Clearly, on the basis of our knowledge of English, and in particular of our knowledge of what English sentences mean, we can say that this sentence would be true just in case a certain physical object (entity) named by the words ―the Washington Monument‖ and another entity named by the words ―the Capitol Building‖ stand in a certain spatial and temporal relation named by the words ―is west of.‖...in truth-conditional semantics we answer a question of the form ―What is the meaning of sentence S?‖ by providing some sort of description of how things would have to be arranged in some relevant corner of the world in order for S to be true. (Dowty, Wall and Peters 1989, p.5) 32 Notice two things. Firstly, Dowty et al. claim that the aim of formal semantics is to describe the expression-extension relations that naturally occurring expressions stand in to elements of the world: ―the proper business of semantics is to specify how language connects with the world – in other words, to explicate the inherent ―aboutness‖ of language.‖ Admittedly, this is a kind of battle cry to distinguish truth-conditional semantics from other approaches which attempt to relate expressions to supposed mental states of speakers. Nonetheless, what ends up being said is that the business of formal semantics is to study expression-extension relations, to specify them. However, secondly, notice what this specification ends up being. It takes the form: ―The Washington Monument is west of the Capitol Building‖ is true if and only if the extension of ―The Washington Monument‖ and the extension of ―the Capitol Building‖ stand in the relation that is the extension of ―is west of‖ to which we might as well add, whatever those extensions happen to be. So in practice the endeavour is to describe relations between possible distributions of extensions of these expressions, given their syntactic categories, and not to provide any account of what those extensions actually are for these expressions as employed by English speakers. 2.4 Similar distinctions There are distinctions drawn by several philosophers which it might seem I could have used instead of the above. However, the statements I can find of them are not what I intend. I want to take a moment to explain why I have not employed these existent distinctions. 2.4.1 Descriptive semantics and foundational semantics One distinction is drawn by Stanley and Szabo.16 It is between foundational and descriptive semantics.17 Descriptive semantics offers descriptions of what the semantic values are of linguistic expressions. Foundational semantics offers accounts of why the linguistic expressions have the semantic values they do have. For instance, we can distinguish between two theories about the semantic values that names have: an extension or an intension. Which is correct, if either, is a descriptive semantic question. We can then ask why it is that a name has whatever semantic value it has. One view which attempts to address that issue is Kripke's causal-historical theory of names. This is a foundational semantic issue. 16 (Stanley and Szabo 2000 [2007], pp.70-76) 17 Stanley and Szabo take their distinction from Stalnaker (1997, pp.535-537). 33 But our distinctions are about no more than what semantic values expressions have. What is interesting about them (potentially) is that they distinguish between different senses in which we might say that expressions have semantic values: for how long do they need to have them to count as having them, and, how is what they have (e.g. an intension) to be understood? Stanley and Szabo leave those questions unasked and unanswered. 2.4.2 Semantics and metasemantics Kaplan draws a distinction between what he calls semantics and metasemantics.18 This appears to be the same as Stanley and Szabo's distinction: semantics equals descriptive semantics and metasemantics equals foundational semantics. However, Kaplan goes on to say the following: To argue that character belongs to metasemantics, one would have to regard indexicals as systematically ambiguous and as having no meaning at all outside a particular context of use. This is a view that seems reasonable for generic names, the kind of name that all us Davids have in common. (Kaplan 1989, p.574) In this passage Kaplan implies that if something is a feature of semantics there must be a long regularity in the relation between that something and a given word. So because qua generic name there is nothing constant to all the Davids, there is nothing for semantics to describe, but nonetheless, something for metasemantics to describe. This suggests that Kaplan associates semantics with the documenting of long regularities between expressions and their substantial semantic values. This is different from the earlier gloss: it identifies semantics with the documenting of long regularities relating kinds of expression and substantial semantic values and metasemantics with regularities that are not long. But the original gloss he offered on his distinction concerned a distinction between what and why. Either way, the semantics/metasemantics distinction is not desirable for our purposes. Either it fails to address the questions we want to raise just as Stanley and Szabo's does, or worse, it defines those pursuits in such a way that a position is adopted on what regularities there are where we want to leave that issue open for discussion. 18 (Kaplan 1989, pp.573-576) 34 2.4.3 Languages and language Lewis draws a distinction between possible languages and languages used by particular populations of speakers.19 The possible languages are none other than expressions for which there is a formal semantics, including a non-stipulated model. For a possible language to be one used by a community just is for their use of its expressions to be a long regularity in substantial truth-conditions for sentences (etc.).20 So Lewis' distinction focuses solely on long regularities in substantial truth-conditions. So just like Kaplan's second gloss on his distinction, Lewis' distinction does not leave open the issues we are going to address. 2.5 Language and socio-historical questions One might object to the appeal I have made to regularities in the uses of expressions by speakers. One might draw a distinction between a language per se and the use of a language or the speakers of a language. One might then claim that I am not discussing the same subject matter as one is concerned with. In response to this I have the following to say. The theories of languages which take the form of a formal semantics are empirical theories. Their constructors take pride in this fact. To be empirical one needs evidence of an empirical phenomenon. That evidence is the behaviour of speakers of different languages. That is the basis upon which hypotheses are formed and it is the gauntlet they have to run when tested. Such theories are theories about invariances in the behaviour of speakers and this is all I mean to speak of in speaking of regularities in the uses of expressions by speakers.21 3 Minimalists and contextualists on propositions and truthconditions Because it will help us to understand the position of OS relative to others, I want to employ our distinctions to attack an existing taxonomical trend. There is a division between what are called ―semantic minimalists‖ and ―radical contextualists.‖ The difference is supposed to be that whereas the minimalists think that there is a minimal proposition associated with most (natural language) sentences, the radical 19 E.g. (Lewis 1973 [1983]) 20 Lewis (1969) introduces logically possible languages as solutions to such problems. That is the raison d'être of the regularity. 21 See (McDowell 1980 [1998], p.49) on this point. 35 contextualists think there is no such proposition. I suspect that this contrast is equivocal because what is meant by ―proposition‖ in each case is different. Suppose that to say that a sentence has associated with it a proposition is to say that the sentence has certain truth-conditions. We can distinguish between two claims that might be made in saying this. The first is that sentences have logico-syntactic truth-conditions. The second is that sentences have substantial truth-conditions. There is good reason to believe that whereas the contextualists, in denying that sentences have associated with them propositions, mean to speak of substantial truth-conditions, the minimalists, in claiming that sentences have associated with them propositions, mean to speak of logico-syntactic truth-conditions. If that is so, then there is reason to doubt there is a real dispute between the two camps in this respect. Two examples of radical contextualism are relevance theory and truth-conditional pragmatics. Relevance theorists talk of propositions as sentences of a language of thought: interpreted sentences of a formal language for which the phenomena typical of natural language sentences do not arise. Since such things have substantial truth-conditions, relevance theorists are using the word ―proposition‖ in the substantial sense.22 The same is so of Recanati. He proposes that one examine intuitions about truth-conditions as follows: One simply has to provide subjects with scenarios describing situations, or, even better, with – possibly animated – pictures of situations, and to ask them to evaluate the target utterance as true or false with respect to the situations in question. (Recanati 2004, p15) If that is the notion of truth-condition with which Recanati operates, then he is not talking about (only) logico-syntactic truth-conditions. To discover logico-syntactic truth-conditions one has to uncover patterns of judgements about the truth (and other properties) of sentences (and other expressions) given the truth (and other properties) of other sentences (and other expressions). One does not need to document judgements about (close to) real situations as Recanati requires. 22 See section 6.4.1.2. 36 Semantic minimalists include Borg, and, Cappelen and Lepore.23 Borg proposes that formal semantics has a very minimal job description. Its job is to do only two things. Firstly, ―to reveal how the meanings of complex expressions are determined given the meanings of their component expressions, together with those expressions' mode of composition.‖ Secondly, ―to help reveal or capture the relations which pertain between those complex expressions, for instance revealing the inferential relations between sentences.‖24 These tasks do not require any commitment to there being long regularities in the substantial intensions or extensions of linguistic expressions.25 So when she says: To capture the literal meaning of a natural language sentence it is necessary and sufficient to determine its truth-conditional or propositional content, and, the formal theorist claims, this content can be recovered via syntactic trails alone. (Borg 2004, p.4) ...and adds, using ―dual pragmatics‖ to speak of the likes of truth-conditional pragmatics and relevance theory: ...dual pragmatics rejects the idea that truth-conditional or propositional content can (usually) be recovered via formal methods alone. (Borg 2004, p.6) ...she is equivocating. For if all she means by truth-conditional or propositional content is that which is described by formal semantics, and if this concerns only what she outlines on the first page of her book, then she is talking about logicosyntactic truth-conditions. But the likes of truth-conditional pragmatics and relevance theory are not in the business of denying that sentences have those. They are in the business of denying that sentences have substantial truth-conditions.26 23 (Borg 2004) and (Cappelen and Lepore 2005). 24 (Borg 2004, p.1) 25 E.g. (Borg 2004, p.169, p.240). Borg does seem to waver in her minimalism when she assumes that a sentence of a natural language is to be mapped onto a sentence of a language of thought by a formal semantics (Borg 2004, p.24). Presumably the latter kind of sentence has substantial reference and truth-conditions but then if such a mapping obtains then a natural language sentence will also have substantial reference and truth-conditions. But this is precisely what she denies. So either there are LOT sentences which are just as vacuous as NL sentences, or, Borg ought to drop this commitment. 26 (Borg 2009) practically acknowledges this. 37 Cappelen and Lepore propose that sentences have propositions, in some sense, associated with them. But what sense? The commitments one makes in expressing such a thing are something on which they stay silent. So I cannot pin on them precisely the view I think they have by citing explicit assertions to that effect. However, what we can do is check to see what reasons there are for thinking they are not adopting a view that is not in conflict with the likes of truth-conditional pragmatics and relevance theory. Here are two reasons. One might be led into thinking they mean something more substantial than the logico-syntactic because of their concern with understanding and shared content in communication. But the passages in which they mention such concerns are still equivocal. If all that is meant by understanding a sentence of the form [S NP Pred] is that it is true just in case the extension of the NP falls within the extension of the predicate then that need not amount to understanding what someone has said in any substantial sense. It would not be enough to enable one to have a determinate and (if the uttered sentence is true) accurate expectation of how things are. A second reason one might be led to think they mean something more substantial in their talk of truth, falsity, and propositions, is their attention to issues of metaphysics. They think that there is an answer to the question of what something that satisfies ―is red‖ is simpliciter. But it is a job for metaphysicians to describe that. And what do metaphysicians do? Think about what metaphysicians do...Suppose, for example, you're interested in what consciousness is. Then you ask a question like  What do all conscious things have in common?' If you're interested in what causation is, you ask  What do all events A and B have in common in which A causes B?'...Notice that none of these questions are about language. They are not about the expressions  conscious,'  cause'...They are not about how people use those expressions. They are nonlinguistic questions. (Cappelen and Lepore 2005, p.159). So there is something that is a substantial extension of certain predicates. The predicate ―is red‖ is about red things. But, as with Borg, what does this really amount to? What sentences give us on Cappelen and Lepore's view is not the kind of determinacy as to what to expect to be so which substantial truth-conditions are 38 supposed to deliver. Whatever that is, it is certainly not a basis upon which to communicate how things are in any sense determinate enough to act on, for instance. Of course, Cappelen and Lepore think there is something important about what sentences do deliver. But it is far from clear that the reason they think what they do deliver is important is that they deliver these sorts of things. They say, for instance, that such will not deliver the intuitive notion of what someone said.27 Presumably this latter notion is supposed to deliver determinate expectations as to how the world needs to be for what was said to be true. In this they are not at all different from the likes of Recanati, and, Sperber and Wilson. Cappelen and Lepore do consider our accusation but their discussion of this is equivocal. In an attempt to starkly distance themselves from their purported opponents, they say: We think, and the Relevance Theorists deny, that there is a minimal semantic content or proposition that is semantically expressed by (almost) every utterance of a well-formed English sentence. This proposition is not a  skeleton'; it is not fragmentary; it's a full-blooded proposition with truthconditions and truth-value. (For elaboration, see Chapter 11.) This is a substantial disagreement about the metaphysics of content. (Cappelen and Lepore 2005, p.181) The first sentence can be read in various ways depending upon how ―semantic content or proposition‖ is understood: substantially or logico-syntactically. Hence, the equivocation which would mean there is no dispute is carried through into the very attempt to make the disavowal. Perhaps, you are thinking, there is a real dispute to be found in their Chapter 11? But that is the chapter where they discuss semantics and metaphysics and we have already seen how that discussion is equally equivocal on the matter of concern. 4 A hypothesis We have in hand three distinctions: expressions versus expression instances; long versus transient regularities in the properties of linguistic expressions; and logicosyntactic versus substantial truth-conditions (satisfiers, referents). With them we can make out a hypothesis that one might be tempted to adopt: 27 (Cappelen and Lepore 2005, p.181) 39 There are long regularities in the substantial extensions of expressions of natural languages. The hypothesis is one to the effect that there is a language-environment regularity to be found (when observing speakers of a language) between instances of: (a) true sentences and conditions of the world; or/and (b) NPs and items as their referents; or/and (c) predicates and items as their satisfiers, which have the longevity of one's capacity to speak the language.28 Some clarifications:  The hypothesis applies only to non-logical and non-mathematic statements.  One does not doubt the hypothesis if one thinks there are some expressions for which it does not hold, e.g. because of sentences that include indexicals for which there are no long regularities in substantial extension or because of sentences that are ambiguous (lexically and syntactically) or because one thinks NPs do not exhibit long regularities in their extensions. I intend the hypothesis to be that there are some expressions (e.g. predicates) for which there are long regularities in their substantial extensions.  The regularities in question include those relativised to various parameters (for example, but not restricted to: w, i, and c) or other factors. It is not just about formal semantics that provide extensional analyses.29  There are those who hold differing views on what truth is. For example Dummett favours a switch from talk of truth-conditions to assertability conditions.30 Several philosophers adopt a view according to which the truth predicate means different things for different domains of discourse: e.g. compare mathematics and ethics. By and large, I do not mean for the hypothesis to distinguish between these. The reason for this is that no matter what one's view on the nature of truth is, there is a natural phenomenon wherein speakers ascribe and withhold ascription of a property which they in English call ―truth.‖ This practice is connected with others to do with ascribing and withholding ascription of objects as referents of 28 Travis has always been concerned with reference and satisfaction as well as truthconditions. This is explicit in his (1975), (1978), (1980), and (1981) where a large number of pages are concerned with each. But in his (1985) and various more commonly cited subsequent papers, the referents of referring expressions are given less coverage. Though not zero coverage: see for instance Chapter 2 of (Travis 2006). 29 Travis clearly means to reject any such view. See in particular (Travis 1978), (Travis 1981, pp.45-72), and (Travis 1997 [2008], pp.114-117). 30 Cf. (Dummett 1959) 40 referring expressions and as satisfiers of predicative expressions. There may or may not be regularities of certain sorts in this practice. The hypothesis is a claim to the effect that there are certain regularities. These regularities are in part what supply the subject matter for theories of truth. They are not something that changes with different such theories. The exception to this indifference is logical and mathematical talk. 5 Two hypothesis believers When we attack the hypothesis we will not be punching straw men. Here are two prominent philosophers of language who held this hypothesis: early Donald Davidson and David Lewis. Both of these thinkers attempt to outline what those engaged in the empirical study of meanings of linguistic expressions ought to be looking for. It is in doing this that each adopts the hypothesis. 5.1 Early Davidson Davidson made claims about any theory that describes ―the skill or ability of a person who has learned to speak a language.‖31 Firstly, he claims that this ability is something one comes to have when one has learned to speak a language and it is one that is exercised in producing and understanding sentences of that language.32 So what is described will be something that persists from the time since one learnt the language on through one's linguistic career; a long regularity. Secondly, he claims that the ability is one described by a theory which specifies the truth conditions of every sentence of the language in the style of a Tarskian theory of truth. Hence, it will explain the conditions of truth of sentences in terms of the referents and satisfiers of the constituent expressions in the sentence. The evidence for such a theory is supposed to enable formulation of empirical generalisations about, for example, what the satisfiers of predicates are as used by speakers.33 Such things are not to be stipulated but instead constructed by observing the particular relations between expressions and their extensions. Hence the truthconditions described by the theory of meaning, being explained as they are, must be substantial. So (early) Davidson's theories of meaning are theories that document 31 (Davidson 1965 [1984], pp.7-8). I am supposing in this discussion that there are no significant differences between truth-theoretic formal semantics and model theoretic formal semantics which matter to the current discussion. 32 (Davidson 1965 [1984], p.8) 33 See e.g. (Davidson 1967 [1984], p.26) and (Davidson 1973 [1984], pp.133-138). 41 long regularities in the substantial extensions of expressions of a language. Because he presupposes that there are such regularities, he adopts the hypothesis. 5.2 Lewis As we saw earlier, Lewis distinguishes between possible languages and languages used by a person or population. This distinction involves adoption of the hypothesis. A possible language is a formal semantics that provides substantial truth-conditions (etc.) for its sentences (etc.). For such to be used is for there to be a long regularity in the use of expressions that can be described using this formal semantics.34 So Lewis adopts the hypothesis. 6 Occasion-sensitivity Occasion-sensitivity can now be defined as the denial of the hypothesis. It is denied that there is a long regularity in the substantial extensions of expressions of natural languages. According to OS, to expect there to be long regularities in the substantial extensions of an expression of a language is like expecting a long regularity in the colour of an expression of a language. For instance, a predicate of a language does not have a colour. Just as there are no long regularities to be found in the colours of instances of the predicate ―is 100 years old‖ there are no long regularities to be found in the substantial satisfiers of the predicate, ―is 100 years old,‖ not even as relativised to various further factors. Just as this is in no way to deny that (some) instances of the predicate ―is 100 years old‖ have colours, this is in no way to deny that instances of the predicate can and in many cases do have substantial satisfiers. 6.1 Travis's own exposition. The way I have defined OS (as the rejection of a hypothesis) is an attempt to avoid a problem that faces Travis' statement of his own view. You may recall that earlier I stated that Travis' statement of his own view is equivocal when read in an environment populated by similar proposals. My definition of OS might appear to be some distance from Travis' more typical statements. I want to show how the two are related. An example of such a statement is the following: 34 See Lewis (1969, Chapter 5), (1970, p.190), and (1973 [1983], pp.163-166). 42 ...it would seem that the meanings of sentences are not to be explained in terms of truth conditions, sentences bearing the former but not the latter, and mutatis mutandis for sentence parts. (Travis 1985, p.188)35 So, sentences do not have truth-conditions. To begin, it is clear enough that the reason he gives in this paper for thinking sentences do not have truth-conditions is not that NPs (per se) have no referents (even though we know he thinks that too). The point is supposed to apply to all linguistic expressions (sentences and their parts). Of his claim we can raise two exegetical questions: is he speaking of substantial or logico-syntactic truth-conditions? and; does he mean to deny that sentences have truth-conditions (in some sense) tout court, or only that there is a long regularity in the truth-conditions (in some sense) of sentences? This gives us two questions and hence, depending upon the answer to each, four possible readings: 1) There are no long regularities in the logico-syntactic truth-conditions of sentences. 2) There are no long regularities in the substantial truth-conditions of sentences. 3) There are no transient regularities in the logico-syntactic truth-conditions of sentences. 4) There are no transient regularities in the substantial truth-conditions of sentences. Only (2) is being said in the Travis quotation. I aim to show this by examining the context of the quotation. But note: taken on its own, the quotation can be read these four different ways. That will prove important in two respects. Firstly, insofar as this statement is typical, it helps us understand why Travis' work is so often treated as not significantly different from what I will come to call ―further 35 The reprint of this paper in (Travis 2008) is substantially revised. You will not find the quoted passage there. For similarly problematic statements see (Travis 1997 [2008], p.109) and (Travis 2008, p.2). I will assume henceforth that there is not significantly more to the claim that the meaning of a sentence should not be explained in terms of truth-conditions than that a sentence does not have truth-conditions. 43 factor views.‖ Secondly, that this statement (and others) can be read as (1), has, I think, led to some confusion about whether Travis seeks to deny the veracity of empirical work done by formal semanticists.36 We will now take our two questions in order. Is Travis talking about substantial or logico-syntactic truth? He says of a sentence that, given the evidence he presents, ―one would also expect that there could not be a (substantive) condition for its truth.‖37 So Travis distinguishes between substantive and some other kind of condition for its truth. So there is room for some notion of a condition for a sentence's truth, but not a ―substantive‖ condition. What might be meant here? In footnotes 5 and 6 of that paper we find the targets of the 1978 paper and the 1981 book: early Davidson and Lewis. From this we know that the substantive notion is one to be found in those authors. As we have just seen they propose theses about substantial truth-conditions and not only logico-syntactic truth-conditions. So then, given such targets to which Travis opposes himself, he must be speaking of substantial truth-conditions in our sense; that is, truth-conditions in the sense that Lewis and early Davidson claim sentences of a language possess. I am going to assume that whatever would be a less than substantive notion of truth-condition, it encompasses what I have called logico-syntactic truth-conditions. If the reader doubts this, the reader can suppose that Travis leaves that question open. Nonetheless, (1) and (3) are stronger claims than Travis' prose gives reason to ascribe. Indeed, what is at issue in practically all of Travis' writings on this subject is what counts as being a referent or a satisfier or a condition of truth of an expression. The logico-syntactic properties of expressions are left untouched by conclusions drawn on such issues. No intent contrary to this is ever expressed. Is Travis denying that there are long regularities or that there are ever any regularities to be found in the substantial truth-conditions of sentences? To answer this question we need to situate Travis' remarks relative to our distinction between expressions and expression instances. Travis draws this distinction himself. For instance, he speaks of ―an expression – e.g., an English one...‖38 The use of the modifier ―an English‖ appears regularly in his work to mark a contrast between 36 See section 6.3. 37 (Travis 1985, p.188) 38 (Travis 1985, p.187) 44 sentence type and a historical instance of such. In the 1985 paper he distinguishes an English expression from some production of it: ...typically, an (e.g.) English expression is such that, with its meaning (unambiguously) fixed, there are a variety of distinct (perhaps better: distinguishable) things to be said in using it on some production of it or other. (Travis 1985, p.187)39 So in the paper we are discussing, when he denies that sentences' meanings are to be explained in terms of truth conditions, he is speaking of sentences as contrasted with instances of such. The sentences are ―of a language‖ and so I think it safe to understand him as speaking of the kind of thing one learns when one learns to speak a language, and things of which one has knowledge for the duration for which one speaks the language. So the quotation targets a claim about long regularities in substantial truth-conditions of sentences and not their having truthconditions tout court. This is also evidenced by the fact that he does ascribe substantial truth to sentences.40 If he were making the denial that there were even transient regularities in the substantial truth-conditions of sentences, then he would not make such remarks. So the quotation ought not to be read as (4) or then again, this time for a different reason, (3). We are left with (2) as the only plausible reading of the quotation once the surrounding prose is taken into consideration. This is so even though it is equivocal when that surrounding prose is ignored, as our two exegetical questions make plain. 6.2 OS and the later Davidson Travis explicitly distinguishes OS from the ideas of the later Davidson. My gloss on OS can be read as a version of the later Davidson's view. This suggests a need for clarification.41 Travis discusses Davidson's later work in order to provide a reading of a sentence by Timothy Williamson.42 The sentence is: 39 See also (Travis 1981, p.26, pp.37-38) 40 (Travis 1985, pp.199-200) 41 I will ignore Davidson's (1986, p.444) flirtation with variations across members of a community of, apparently, typically logico-syntactic regularities. 45 ...[Travis] simply takes the sameness in meaning of the words in his examples as obvious, and does not discuss the possibility of slight meaning changes, as postulated below. (Williamson 1998, 10 n) (Quoted (Travis 2009 [2008], p.174)) Travis then glosses this with the following: [Williamson's view of meaning] is that the meanings of words change, sometimes subtly, over time...I think the meaning changes Williamson has in mind here are meant to support a certain idea about what meaning does. In the case of a predicate, such as  is round', that idea would be that, for a fixed meaning (its meaning at a moment), there is a unique, invariant contribution it would make to the truth condition of any whole it was a part of while meaning that. Though the meaning of  is round' may change over time, freeze it at a time, and it does have a satisfaction condition of just the sort Davidson envisaged...But for currently irrelevant details as to how an idiolect is fixed, and the importance of speaker intentions (or understandings) in fixing what was, in fact, said on an occasion in given words, this idea about meaning is essentially the later view of Donald Davidson on that topic. (Travis 2009 [2008], pp.177-178) Travis complains that this is ―not yet the result we wanted.‖ The reason this is not the view Travis favours is that he thinks that with changes in, for instance, what satisfies a given predicate (like, ―is round‖), there is no change in the meaning of the predicate and that this indicates that the meaning of a predicate does not settle what satisfies the predicate. But Davidson's view was that the meaning constantly shifted and that that is why there are changes in the satisfiers of a predicate if there are any: because that which determines what the satisfiers are, namely meaning, shifts. So far in describing the hypothesis I have made no claims about meaning. The hypothesis has concerned something which may or may not be the meaning of a linguistic expression. So how does meaning, and the later Davidson's view, relate to what has been said here? That depends on what is meant by ―meaning.‖ Often when we speak of the meanings of words we do not speak of things which shift from 42 (Travis 2009 [2008]) 46 instance to instance of those words. We speak of things which shift over longer periods of time than that. For instance, the word ―girl‖ used to mean a young person. It now means a young female. So now if one were to speak of a newborn which is male by saying ―it is a girl‖ one would speak falsely whereas presumably at some point in the past, one would not have done so. But the word ―girl‖ does not change its meaning, in this sense of meaning, from instance to instance of it. You do not at one moment use it to speak of what we ordinarily speak of as windows, at another moment to speak of what we ordinarily speak of as Americans, and at another to speak of what we ordinarily speak of as crustaceans. You would be misusing the word if you did this. You would not be speaking English. That is one way to use the word ―meaning‖: to speak of something that limits the correct usage of a word in this sort of way. But one could also use the word ―meaning‖ in another way. One could say that by ―meaning‖ one means to speak of the extension or something which, given various other factors, determines the extension of an expression. If so, and if OS is true, then, one could say that there are changes in the meaning of ―girl‖ from instance to instance. But if one used the word ―meaning‖ in this second sense one need not have been claiming what one would have been claiming had one used it in the first sense. One would not be claiming that one minute one can use ―girl‖ to mean what is usually meant by ―crustaceans‖ and another ―Americans.‖ Davidson's later view was argued for on the basis of the understandability of malapropisms. In such cases, one uses a word which in English, for instance, means something which rules out one's usage as correct. One uses ―epithet‖ for what is usually spoken of with ―epigram‖ for instance. That is an example of using the word with different meanings in the first sense of ―meaning‖ just considered. That gives us reason to gloss Davidson's later view as: the meanings of words, in the first sense, change from instance to instance. But so read, rejection of the hypothesis is not the later Davidson's view. For the hypothesis does not say anything about meaning so understood. So read, we can agree with Travis that OS is not to be identified with the later Davidson's view. But there is also reason to suspect that Davidson did not mean to deny that meanings of words, in the first sense, remain invariant across the uses of expressions during roughly the length of time a speaker speaks a language. Although he argued the point by means of malapropisms, the conclusion he 47 reached was actually expressed in terms of T-theories. T-theories concern extensions of expressions. To propose that these change from instance to instance of an expression is to propose that there are on-going changes in the meaning of expressions in the second sense of ―meaning.‖ Read in that way, rejection of the hypothesis is of a piece with the later Davidson. But then it is not clear, in this case, that Travis' own view should be distinguished from Davidson's later view, so read, either. To summarise, we can distinguish two ways to read the later Davidson. Read one way, Travis is right to distance himself from Davidson, but in that case rejection of the hypothesis is not adoption of the later Davidson's view. Read the other way, Travis is wrong to distance himself from Davidson on the ground that he does and rejection of the hypothesis would be to adopt Davidson's view. 6.3 OS and compositional semantics There is a tendency by some to interpret OS as a rejection of formal semantics. In particular, the linguistic phenomena motivating OS are taken to be challenges to a principle of compositionality wherein the truth-value of a sentence depends upon contributions made by the constituents of the sentence. Szabo claims that Travis presents counterexamples to a principle of compositionality and this causes Szabo to propose a novel semantic analysis of the sentences he thinks are affected by the phenomenon in an attempt to expunge it from the analysis.43 Pietroski claims that Travis is proposing that formal semantic analyses of sentences cannot be given because of what Travis cases are supposed to show.44 Kennedy and McNally45, Predelli46, and Stanley47 each make the same accusation. It should be clear by now that this is simply not true. OS is a rejection not of the results got from that enterprise but of a particular interpretation of them. According to OS they should be understood as describing logico-syntactic truthconditions and not substantial truth-conditions. There is no need to deny the compositional element to be found in formal semantics because of this. 43 (Szabo 2001) on (Travis 1994 [2008]). In a later paper, Szabo (2010) discusses the same paragraph and again supposes that it is evidence against compositionality which needs to be responded to. 44 (Pietroski 2003, p.234 and fn.14) on (Travis 1985). 45 (Kennedy and McNally 2010, pp.80-81) on (Travis 1997 [2008]). 46 (Predelli 2005) and (Predelli 2005a) 47 (Stanley 2007, p.80) on (Travis 1997 [2008]). 48 6.4 OS and further factor views There is a variety of views about the truth-conditions of sentences which we can call ―further factor views.‖ We have already seen semantic analyses which make the truth-value of a sentence depend upon more than the constituent expressions of that sentence and their mode of combination. The parameters w, i, and c in our toy semantics do that. I do not want to call these ―further factor views.‖ The views I want to call that introduce elements beyond the constituent expressions of a sentence and those features mentioned in our toy semantics upon which the truthvalue of a sentence depends. Henceforth that is what will be meant by talk of further factors. To adopt a further factor view is not necessarily to reject the hypothesis. One can maintain that there are long regularities in the substantial truth-conditions of sentences that include hitherto unconsidered further factors. 6.4.1 Psychological further factor views The following position is also possible: there are further factors relevant to the truth-value of instances of a sentence and these factors are psychological properties of an interlocutor (speaker or hearer of the sentence). This is a sub-variety of further factor view: psychological further factor views. Whether such a view is to reject the hypothesis depends upon whether one thinks there is any pattern in the relevance of these psychological further factors that persists for a long longevity. One need not think that. One could allow that there are psychological factors relevant to the truth-value of instances of sentences but suppose that there is no long-longevity to their relevance. But one could also think that there is such a thing. OS is commonly put under the banner ―radical contextualism.‖48 Views which also fall under that banner include Recanati's truth-conditional pragmatics49 and Sperber and Wilson's relevance theory.50 However, there is good reason to think that the latter two views are psychological further factor views that maintain the hypothesis. If so, placing all three views in one category is a confusing mistake. 48 Since, that is, the taxonomically influential (Cappelen and Lepore 2005) 49 See (Recanati 2004) and (Recanati 2011) 50 See (Sperber and Wilson 1986) and (Sperber and Wilson 1995) 49 6.4.1.1 Truth-conditional pragmatics One might suppose that there is a long regularity in the semantic values of linguistic expressions. Recanati proposes that this is a kind of default position. But that when speakers speak there is a process, which he calls ―modulation,‖ wherein the semantic values of expressions are modified from what they are by default. Modulation is not a random process. Someone's psychological apparatus includes a pool of semantic values. These can vary in ―accessibility‖: variation in which semantic value is the more or less accessible. This variation is affected by factors other than the linguistic expression employed. Semantic values compete to be the actual semantic value of an expression instanced. That which is most accessible becomes the semantic value of the expression as used.51 Recanati adds to this that modulation is describable as a function mod which takes an expression and a context of use as arguments and returns a modulation function.52 A modulation function when applied to an expression modifies the extension of the expression in some way. E.g. mod( the city', c) = g513(CITY), where g513 is a modulation function, and, g513(CITY) = (INHABITANTS OF THE CITY). Instead of operating on the extensions of expressions that the valuation function F assigns, a formal semantics operates upon the values of modulation functions that are the values of mod as applied to an expression in a given context. Hence rather than using semantic rule (c) from our toy semantics: c) I([s NP Pred])M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff I(NP)M,w,i,c,g  I(Pred)M,w,i,c,g and 0 otherwise. ...we should instead use (c′′′): cʹʹʹ) I([s NP Pred])M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff mod(I(NP)M,w,i,c,g, c)(I(NP)M,w,i,c,g)  mod(I(Pred)M,w,i,c,g, c)( I(Pred)M,w,i,c,g) and 0 otherwise. Because modulation is a psychological process about which Recanati supposes a general theory could be constructed, and because it is reasonable to suppose that a psychological theory will identify regularities of a long-longevity, we can see that there is good reason to suspect Recanati of adopting a psychological further factor 51 Recanati (2004, p.30). There is an additional complexity involving schemata that makes no difference to what is currently at issue. 52 (Recanati 2011, esp. pp.9-10) 50 view that includes commitment to the hypothesis.53 mod is a general way in which context interacts with expressions to modify the truth-conditions of expressions. It is general in the sense that there is a long regularity in the conditions under which speakers of a language count sentences true which is described by mod (in conjunction with a full specification of the modulation functions that are the values of mod).54 6.4.1.2 Relevance theory Whereas truth-conditional pragmatics operates with a model of the mind as a pool of semantic values with greater or less accessibility, relevance theory operates with a model of the mind as information processor. Something like accessibility still has a role to play but it operates on different units to that envisaged by Recanati. Let us distinguish between NL-sentences (natural language sentences) and LOTsentences (language of thought sentences). Notably LOT-sentences are not supposed to exhibit the same behaviour as NL-sentences.55 LOT-sentences can be understood as sentences of an interpreted formal language.56 On the relevance theoretic view NL-sentences have the truth-conditions of LOT-sentences; but which LOT-sentence for which NL-sentence? The general idea is that LOT-sentences vie for providing the truth-conditions of an NL-sentence in a similar way to the way semantic values vie for being the semantic values of constituent expressions of NLsentences in truth-conditional pragmatics. More specifically though, relevance theorists tell the following story about episodes of communication with NL- 53 That it is a psychological theory that is in question peppers Recanati's writings. That the theory is supposed to provide generalisations (which presumably, given the definition of mod, will generate predictions about when speakers will classify sentence instances as true, for a long longevity) can be seen in remarks such as at (Recanati 2011, p.11). 54 It is possible that the way in which c gets its value is not something which is invariant for a long longevity. Then Recanati would not be upholding the hypothesis. But if that were so, there would be no point in adding the material he is here proposing to a formal semantics at all. Why not just allow the model of the formal semantics to vary? I assume that he would not add pointless extensions to that formal semantics. I think he does so because he thinks there is something to document here which has the same longevity as logico-syntactic truth-conditions. Therefore I assume that how c gets its value is invariant for a long longevity. 55 This is implicit in their exposition. But if LOT-sentences were to be just like NLsentences, then the account relevance theorists offer of communication and understanding would simply not be an account of any such thing. That this is being supposed also renders relevance theory vulnerable to the argument of Chapters IV and V. That argument applies as much to LOT-sentences as it does NL-sentences. 56 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, pp.172-173) 51 sentences, and therein, about how instances of NL-sentences have the truthconditions they do. Consider a speaker and an addressee. An ostensive stimulus is a stimulus which when presented by a speaker indicates that the speaker has a communicative intention.57 A communicative intention is an intention that the addressee infer that the speaker has an informative intention.58 An informative intention is an intention that the addressee infer a given LOT-sentence.59 When a LOT-sentence plays this role we will call it the characteristic LOT-sentence of the pertinent communicative intention. NL-sentences are ostensive stimuli. Unfortunately NL-sentences underdetermine what the characteristic LOT-sentence is: for a given NL-sentence there is not a corresponding LOT-sentence. So an addressee cannot discern what a speaker is communicating just by examining the NL-sentence a speaker produces. Fortunately, a production of an ostensive stimulus ―communicates a presumption of its own optimal relevance.‖60 So one thing the addressee can bank on when she attempts to identify the characteristic LOT-sentence the speaker is attempting to communicate is that whatever the characteristic LOT-sentence is, it is optimally relevant. So if the addressee can discern what is the optimally relevant LOT-sentence, she can discern what is the characteristic LOT-sentence of the speaker's communicative intention. What is optimal relevance? Relevance simpliciter consists of a ratio between contextual effect and processing effort.61 A LOT-sentence's contextual effect is the effect produced when it is combined with a context. A context as here understood is a set of LOT-sentences which are ―manifest‖ at the time at which the ostensive stimulus is presented, which means, such that a cognitive system is ―capable of representing [them] mentally and accepting [their] representation as true or probably true.‖62 The effect could be the strengthening or weakening of a member of context; the inference to new members of context; or the inference to the negation of present members of context.63 The processing effort is how much time 57 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, p.153) 58 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, p.61) 59 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, p.58) 60 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, p.158) 61 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, pp.144-145; pp.152-153) 62 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, p.39) 63 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, pp.108-117) 52 and energy has to be put into a cognitive process.64 The more energy and time spent, the greater the effort. A LOT-sentence is relevant to the extent that it has large contextual effects with little processing effort.65 A LOT-sentence is optimally relevant if and only if (a) it is relevant enough to be worth the addressee processing it, and (b), the LOT sentence is the most relevant compatible with the communicator's abilities and preferences.66 Hence, when a speaker attempts to communicate a given LOTsentence to an addressee, the speaker attempts to express a LOT-sentence that is relevant ―enough‖ to that addressee to be worth processing and the addressee attempts to identify a LOT-sentence that the speaker would think is ―most relevant‖ to the addressee. So, the underdetermination of the characteristic LOTsentence by the NL-sentence produced in communication does not thwart successful communication because the speaker will only attempt to express optimally relevant LOT-sentences and the addressee will act as though this is so. However, this will lead to successful communication (identification of one and the same LOT-sentence as the characteristic LOT-sentence) only if the context by which the addressee calculates the relevance of LOT-sentences is the same as the context by which the speaker calculates the relevance of LOT-sentences. Otherwise there is no reason to expect the same LOT-sentence to be identified by each by means of the procedure described by relevance theorists in episodes of communication.67 Attempting to calculate the most relevant LOT-sentence would be like trying to identify a chameleon by its colour: what counts as relevant, in this technical sense, would be left indeterminate because disparate between speaker and addressee. So then we should ask: what ensures that both interlocutors employ the same context in their calculation of the relevance of LOT-sentences? Sperber and Wilson draft in an additional assumption to alleviate this concern. Part of relevance theory is the cognitive principle of relevance: ―Human Cognition tends to be geared to the maximisation of relevance.‖68 The additional assumption 64 E.g. (Sperber and Wilson 1995, p.46) 65 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, p.125) 66 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, p.158; p.270) 67 I am assuming that since LOT-sentences are elements of human psychology that all interlocutors share the same LOT-sentences or the capacity to have the same LOTsentences. 68 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, p.260) 53 is that this cognitive principle ―does indeed make the cognitive behaviour of another human predictable enough to guide communication.‖69 That human cognition (each interlocutor's cognitive system) ―tends to be geared to the maximisation of relevance‖ is something that explains how interlocutors identify the same context by which to interpret an NL-sentence only if it led to the same context being used for interpretation by each. Hence, the cognitive principle of relevance must entail that the cognitive systems of interlocutors generally will make the same LOT-sentences salient in the same circumstances. But then part of the relevance theoretic story about communication is this: the contexts used by speaker and addressee to calculate the relevance of a LOT-sentence, when faced with an NL-sentence in a particular environment, are generally the same because the interlocutors share the same cognitive apparatus. The truth-conditions of an NL-sentence can now be described in the following way. Given a particular environment in which an NL-sentence is produced, there will be a corresponding context which all interlocutors who are capable of communicating will share. We can categorise environments by the contexts that correspond to them. We can then say that there is a function which has as its arguments an NLsentence and an environment type, and has its values, LOT-sentences. If there were not this regularity, then an estimation of what is optimally relevant would not be a way to estimate a determinate LOT-sentence. There would be what is most relevant to me and what is most relevant to you, but no way to ensure these coincide. An objective property of relevance requires a coincidence of interpretation of the communicative episode, shared by both interlocutors. According to relevance theory, there is this coincidence because interlocutors share the same cognitive apparatus. Because this regularity is a cognitive regularity, it has the longevity of our cognitive infrastructure, a long regularity. Finally, this regularity is one in the substantial truth-conditions of NL-sentences. For NL-sentences have the truth-conditions of particular, though varying, LOTsentences and LOT-sentences supply what is learned in communication. If they were only logico-syntactic truth-conditions it would be highly misleading to call this  communication' and its success  understanding.' 69 (Sperber and Wilson 1995, p.263) 54 As with truth-conditional pragmatics, the assumption is maintained that there are long regularities in the substantial truth-conditions of sentences to be found. What relevance theory and truth-conditional pragmatics put in place of a more traditional approach is that these regularities will include various psychological processes. But those processes have a long longevity. For this reason they include commitment to the hypothesis and far from being of a kind with OS, contradict it. 55 C H A P T E R I I Travis' arguments against the hypothesis 1 Three arguments The purpose of this chapter is to evaluate Travis' arguments against the hypothesis. I will discuss three Travisian arguments.70 The first is an argument from an examination of the linguistic data. The second and third are arguments drawn from his readings of Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations.71 The first argument can only lead to stalemate. The data available do not decide whether the hypothesis is true. The second and third arguments do not establish the hypothesis' falsity even if they are sound. At best these arguments support the inherent need for exercises of judgement in language use. But that alone is not sufficient to show that there are no patterns in the exercise of judgement which could make the hypothesis true. 2 The argument from cases Let us consider the argument from linguistic data or cases. The argument begins by first enumerating some linguistic phenomena that have come to be known as 70 There may be more arguments than I have been able to find. A strong candidate for an argument that will not be discussed here can be found in Travis' King's College London inaugural lecture,  Thinking about thinking.' There he presented various observations made by Frege in support of denying a version of the hypothesis for thoughts. One might think there is an argument to be found in (Travis 2000). I do not think so. The only arguments I have been able to find in that publication essentially appeal to linguistic data and so are instances of the argument from cases. The conclusion that Travis has not provided an argument to show that the hypothesis is false is limited in its pretensions to publications up to and including (Travis 2008). I have not scouted Travis' second collection of papers for relevant arguments. 71 (Travis 1989) and (Travis 2006). 56 Travis cases. These concern predicates and their satisfiers.72 This argument concerns the hypothesis as it pertains to them. They have the following form. Take a simple sentence of a natural language such as: 1) That is a duck.73 Then tell n stories within which (1) is uttered. The same object is the referent of ―that‖ in each story and this object is in an unchanged condition in each story. Nonetheless, it is an intuition of native speakers of English that (1) fluctuates in truth-value across each story. Here are three such stories. In each story Fred is walking with his young nephew beside a pond where a decoy duck is floating and pointing to the duck, Fred says (1). But the stories diverge resulting in the following shifts of truth-value of (1): Story 1: ...If Fred had just finished laughing at a sportsman who blasted a decoy out of the pond, and if he has been trying to show his nephew how to avoid similar mistakes, then what he said is false. Story 2: But suppose that Fred and his nephew are attending the annual national decoy exhibition, and the boy has been having trouble distinguishing ducks from geese. Then what Fred said may well be true. Story 3: It might also be true had Fred said what he did in pointing out the fact that all the other ducks were poor copies (perhaps on the order of Donald Duck), and that this is what a proper duck looks like. (Travis 1975, p.51) Here is a second illustration. The most hackneyed example of a Travis case includes a sentence which is about some leaves that are naturally red but have been painted green. The sentence is: 2) The leaves are green. Two stories for this sentence are: Story 4: Suppose that someone's son is asking for some green objects for a photography project. You might well offer the painted leaves that have been 72 The same style of argument can be applied to the referents of referring NPs. 73 The example, (1), and the subsequent stories are taken from (Travis 1975, p.51). 57 gathering dust in your closet since Christmas. You might well say (2) and what you say would, it seems, be true. Story 5: But if someone's daughter asks you for some green leaves for a chemistry practical, and you offer your old Christmas decorations, and you say of them, (2), then what you say, it seems, would be false. The sentences, (1) and (2), are presented as a sample of what Travis claims can be done for any sentence. It is assumed that indefinitely many stories can be generated in which the truth-value of a sentence (any sentence) can be made to change without changes to the object (and its condition) that the sentence is about. That is the first stage of the argument from cases: enumeration of cases. This is supposed to give reason to think the changes in whether an item falls within the extension of a predicate (i.e. is a satisfier of it) are pervasive across predicates of a natural language. The second stage of the argument is argumentative. A formal semantic analysis of a sentence is a function from the extensions of expressions and some other factors (world and time) to a truth-value. According to the hypothesis, a formal semantics, and therefore this function, is supposed to describe a long regularity in the substantial extensions of the expressions constituting the sentence. Typically, when constructing a formal semantic analysis for a sentence, the extensions of expressions are not explicitly identified. However, if a long regularity in the substantial extensions of the expressions constituting the sentence is indeed what is being described, then there should not be changes in the intuitive truth-value of the sentence across its instances when there is no change in the expressions and other factors that provide the arguments to the function described by the formal semantics. So, if one can show that the truth-value of a sentence can change across its instances despite no change in the expressions and the other factors of the analysis, then the extensions of the constituent expressions of the sentence are not constant across the different instances of the sentence (not even as relativised to these factors). If it can be shown that for any formal semantic analysis of a sentence there can be changes in its truth-value without any change in expressions 58 or the other factors in the analysis then formal semantic analyses do not describe long regularities in the substantial extensions of linguistic expressions.74 Let us have in view a starting semantic analysis of (1) and (2). For simplicity I will analyse each as an NP conjoined with a predicate: 3) [S [NPThat] [Pred is a decoy duck]] 4) [S [NP The leaves] [Pred are green]] These can then be analysed with the recursive semantic rules of Chapter I, centrally: c. I([s NP Pred])M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff I(NP)M,w,i,c,g  I(Pred)M,w,i,c,g and 0 otherwise. Let us suppose that ―is a decoy duck‖ and ―are green‖ are assigned intensions by the valuation function F in a model M2. They are assigned extensions relative to each value of w, i, and c for M2. The predicates belong to the syntactic category Vi. The model is: F(That)(c1) = a F(The leaves)(w1,i1) = c F(is a decoy duck)(w1, i1) = {a} F(are green)(w1,i1) = {c} This analysis, if intended as a documentation of a long regularity in the substantial truth-conditions of (1) and (2), fails. The expressions and the other factors (world, time, and context) in these analyses of (1) and (2) do not change across the stories of (1) and (2) but their intuitive truth-values do. These truth-value changes should not be possible if the analyses are descriptions of long regularities in the substantial extensions of the relevant expressions. So the analyses cannot be descriptions of such a thing. We will now examine some alternative proposals that one might offer in response to Travis cases. The proposed analyses will be divided into two sorts: the standard 74 Cf. Chapter I, section 6.3. A principle of compositionality is being assumed in this reasoning. Those who think that, by means of Travis cases, Travis is challenging such a principle do not consider the possibility that he is rejecting the hypothesis instead. In his words, the meaning of a sentence is not to be understood in terms of truth-conditions. 59 and the non-standard. The standard analyses are attempts to show that something like our starting analysis is correct. The non-standard analyses are attempts to show how the starting analysis can be modified to account for the phenomenon. 2.1 Standard semantic analyses 2.1.1 Lexical ambiguity Words can be ambiguous. For instance, ―port‖ is ambiguous between a docking station for ships and a kind of alcoholic drink. E.g.: 5) It was very dark for a Portuguese port. This sentence can be used differently on different occasions. Sometimes with ―port‖ used to speak of shipping docks and sometimes with ―port‖ used to speak of an alcoholic drink. Because of this, the sentence can change in truth-value across such occasions; a single item spoken of across such occasions may be dark in one respect but not the other. One might propose that there is this kind of lexical ambiguity in (1) and (2). On this view, we would need different semantic analyses for the different uses of the sentences because the expressions employed would have multiple entries in the valuation function F of M2 on the different occasions. In a sense, it was not really the same sentence being uttered across the different stories. If this were not so then no change in truth-value would be possible. Is ―duck‖ ambiguous between plastic duck and live duck? Not in the way that ―port‖ is ambiguous. There are ambiguities possible. There is the difference between lowering oneself rapidly and a certain kind of bird. One could use the word ―duck‖ as a noun to describe either of these. Similarly, ―green‖ can be used in various different ways: e.g. it can be used to say of someone that they are naive or that they favour environmentally friendly political policies. But these alternatives are not the right alternatives for our stories. We were not thinking that these kinds of things were being said in any of those stories. One might propose that there is an ambiguity between being green on the outside and green on the inside. But the word ―green‖ is not ambiguous between these usages in the way that ―port‖ is ambiguous between docks and drinks. These are not different entries one might find in a dictionary. So it is not a reasonable analysis of (1) or (2) that their words are ambiguous in the sense that some words are. 60 2.1.2 Syntactic ambiguity The syntactic structure of some sentences is ambiguous: given the words and their order, the sentence can be analysed into two different structures depending upon which words we treat together as units. For example: 6) You are welcome to visit the cemetery where famous Russian and Soviet composers, artists and writers are buried daily except Thursday.75 This sentence is ambiguous between a reading on which ―daily‖ is an adverb of ―visit‖ and a reading on which ―daily‖ is an adverb of ―buried.‖ Because of this, the sentence can fluctuate in truth-value from use to use. Sometimes it is used with one syntactic structure and says something true (viz. that one can visit daily) and sometimes it is used with the other syntactic structure and says something false (viz. that famous Russian and Soviet composers, artists and writers are buried daily). Perhaps there is a syntactic ambiguity in (1) and (2): there are different syntactic structures and so different semantic rules would be relevant to determining the truth-value of the pertinent sentence. If this were stopped from fluctuating, then there would be no change in truth-value for this sentence. But in neither (1) nor (2) is there any structural ambiguity that would account for the change in truth-value of each sentence across the different stories. There are not multiple ways to group together the words into syntactic constituents of the sentence in such a way that two or more readings of the sentence, with the different truth-conditions, can be generated. 2.1.3 Indexicals One source of changes in truth-value across different uses of a sentence is the presence of an indexical or demonstrative expression, like ―he‖ or ―this.‖ But clearly there are no indexical or demonstrative expressions in (1) or (2) that are relevant. In (1) there is the demonstrative but we have stipulated that it is the same object that is in question in the three stories. Suppose the nephew names the duck ―Charlie.‖ Then we could rewrite (1) as: 7) Charlie is a duck. 75 Example taken from: http://www.gray-area.org/Research/Ambig/ 61 With this we could rerun the Travis case with the same conclusion as before. Indexicals and demonstratives are not the source of the fluctuation. 2.1.4 Tense A formal semantic analysis readily allows changes in truth-value that arise from changes in values of i across different uses of the same sentence. Perhaps that is what is happening in the case of (1) and (2)? Perhaps there are changes in the time at which the sentences are uttered to which the change in truth-value can be changed? No. First, we can provide stories in which the utterances are cotemporaneous. Suppose two people utter the sentence at the same time, speaking of the same object. If the circumstances were nonetheless as they are in the stories for each speaker, then, there would still be a divergence in truth-value. Second, even if we do not imagine this, it is difficult to see why a change in time requires a difference in truth-value of the claims made. So long as the objects spoken of remain the same and in the same condition, and so long as there are no differences between the times of utterance for each utterance that have an effect on the truthvalue of the sentence uttered, there is no reason to think that the changes in time of utterance there will be relevant to the truth of the sentence uttered. 2.1.5 Ellipsis Some expressions are elliptical. For example, in (8) one part of the full sentence that A is expressing in his first turn is uttered on A's second turn: 8) A: John bought a new one. B: What? A: ...a new one. With changes in the part of the sentence that A does not utter on his second turn but does on his first, there can be changes in whether what A says in his second turn, if truth-evaluable, is true or false. There would then be different sentences to be analysed in each case. Perhaps (1) and (2) are elliptical for longer sentences where which longer sentence is being ellipsed changes from story to story. For example, (1) might be elliptical for both (1′) and (1′′) and (2) might be elliptical for both (2′) and (2′′): 1′) That's a plastic duck. 62 1′′) That's a live duck. 2′) The leaves are painted green. 2′′) The leaves are naturally green. The different utterances would then not be utterances of the same sentence and would warrant different semantic analyses. The trouble with this as an account of Travis cases is that it appears to be possible to construct novel Travis cases for each de-ellipsed sentence. For instance: Story 6: Jonny's pet duck has died. Its brain has been replaced with an electronic device that maintains the body and has a remote control. But the duck Jonny knew has departed. Jonny's friend, Alice, doesn't know this. She asks, ―how's your duck Jonny? Still alive?‖ Jonny replies, ―nah, he died last week. He's not alive (anymore).‖ What Jonny says is true. Story 7: Jonny's duck is now part of a dance troupe operated at the park by the gardener. One day Jonny's duck is moving about the pond, surrounded by inanimate plastic ducks. Frank and Ted are wondering whether to feed the ducks. Ted objects, ―They're all plastic.‖ Frank responds, ―No. There, look. That's a live duck‖ he says pointing to Jonny's former duck. Frank throws the bread, Jonny's duck bites it, chews it, swallows it, and goes on to digest it. What Frank says is true. Insofar as the phenomenon is a general one the elliptical proposal does not eliminate the fluctuation in truth-value. 2.1.6 Vagueness Some sentences are vague in the following sense. Lay down a colour chart so there is a spectrum from the clearly red to the clearly orange. Some shades will not be such that one cannot provide a clear answer to the question, is that red? So, one finds that one's intuition on the matter may fluctuate from occasion to occasion on which one considers the matter. One might think that there are such things as vague words. Vague words are such that there are items for which it is unclear whether the word is satisfied (or etc.) by them, thereby eliciting the kind of phenomenon just described. Whatever proposal is given for vagueness could be given for Travis cases. There are various ways one might do this: e.g. introduce a 63 third truth-value or propose a stubborn ignorance of just what are ducks and what are green things. However, the intuitive judgements of speakers about the truth of (1) and (2) in the different stories are systematic unlike the judgements yielded in examples of vagueness modelled on the kind of thought experiment I just outlined. If the shifts arose because of vagueness we should expect there to be no system to the shifts. But system is exactly what is found.76 So, it seems unlikely that the shifts in intuitive truth-value arise because of vagueness in this sense (no matter how one analysed the vagueness). 2.1.7 What is said versus what is implicated We could distinguish between something's being strictly speaking true or strictly speaking false, on the one hand, and on the other hand, a looser use of the words ―true‖ and ―false‖ which is strictly speaking an error in the use of those words.77 The proposed analysis is that although we may say that the decoy duck is a duck, strictly speaking it was not a duck. But we speakers of English let this error slide. We allowed ourselves to use the word ―true‖ loosely. We took something that was not strictly speaking sufficient for the sentence to be true to be something that was. In the usual terms that this is put we mistakenly took something which was only implicated by the sentences to be something which was said by the sentences. Suppose we accepted this description of the sentences' behaviour in the different stories. Then when we formulate a semantic analysis of these sentences, we could ignore the intuitions of truth and falsehood there elicited, for they would not record what we should be examining: viz. what was said. We could then stay with our original analysis in model M2. To evaluate this proposal we need a principled way to distinguish between intuitions of truth/falsehood which are relevant to a semantic analysis (viz. what is said) and those which are not. How is it that we are to distinguish between what was said and what was implicated in a principled manner? Grice proposed several tests to distinguish between what is said and what is implicated.78 The one that is relevant to us is cancellability because with it we can argue that the difference in truth-value of our sentences in the different stories is not relevant to a semantic 76 For an experimental confirmation see (Hansen and Chemla manuscript). 77 Cf. (Berg 2002) 78 For a summary of them see (Grice 1975 [1989], pp.39-40) and (Grice 1978 [1989], pp.4344). 64 analysis of the sentence. Suppose someone utters a sentence S. Suppose there is a candidate for what someone said to be so, S′. If one can cogently say, ―S, but I did not mean to imply S′,‖ then, so goes the test, S′ is never part of what one says in uttering S. Whether or not S′ is so is not relevant to the truth of what one says in saying S.79 Now consider (1). We can apply this cancellability test to it. One can say, ―That's a duck, by which I do not mean a plastic decoy.‖ So then the commitment to the object being a plastic decoy is cancelable. So then what would have been said to be so in story 2, contrary to initial intuition, is that there is a duck, but not in the sense of a decoy duck. So strictly speaking, the object's being a decoy duck is not relevant to the truth of (1) and hence what was said would not, strictly speaking, be true, as said of a plastic object. With the distinction between what is said and what is implicated thus clarified, there are two reasons to doubt the effectiveness of this as an analysis which blocks the use of Travis cases to argue against the hypothesis: the second is more potent than the first. The first is that one can postulate all the tests one likes for technical locutions of one's choosing. But in making such a proposal, nothing has been said as against an alternative understanding of such cancellability. On this alternative understanding S′ is part of what one said to be so in uttering ―S‖ but what one said in uttering ―S‖ varies from utterance to utterance. That is, although we have been presented with an alternative interpretation that is not consistent with a view according to which the hypothesis is false, no reason has been given to accept this alternative. The test is just a way of presenting the alternative view. It does not set up the basis upon which we can discover which view is correct. But the proposal does stymie proceedings. For if the Gricean proposal is given credence, and if one is to argue for the hypothesis from Travis cases, then one now has to show that there is something wrong with Grice's way of using those words (―true‖ and ―false‖). One difficulty with Grice's use of those words is that intuition goes against it (if the intuitions exhibited in Travis cases are accepted). He requires us to use the words ―true‖ and ―false‖ as applied to sentences in ways which intuitively we do not use them. However, the sharpness of this response is blunted if we acknowledge that speakers' intuitions are not sacrosanct. Perhaps this is a case in which they should not be respected, the defender of the Gricean proposal might say. If a dispute 79 (Grice 1978 [1989], p.44) 65 breaks out at this point, how one is then to arbitrate the disagreement (about when speakers' intuitions are to be respected) is not something I know how to do. The second cause for doubt is that there is good reason not to engage in such a displacement of ordinary talk (our ordinary assignments of truth and falsity to sentences). If Travis cases are as general as they seem to be, then if one consistently applies this  test,' one will end up classifying practically everything one appeared to be committed to being so in saying  S' as not strictly speaking part of what one is committed to in saying  S,' no matter what  S' happens to be. But then it will be entirely unclear what could make true or false what one said. Why? Bernard Williams puts the point curtly like so: ...if a speaker is confronted with information which clearly proves that what he said was false, and he admits the truth of the information, and will not accept that what he said was false, and has nothing at all to say on how that can be so, this can cast doubt on what he meant, because it may be unclear by now what he would count as making his statement true or false. (Williams 2004, pp.69-70) We have already seen that one can cancel the commitment one appeared to be making in story 2, viz. that the item in question was a decoy duck. Now consider the use of (1) in story 1. We can equally well say, ―that's a duck, by which I don't mean it's a live warm blooded bird.‖ But then what would seem to make false the use of (1) in story 1, does not in fact do so. So then, given the free use of the Gricean test, neither commitment that it appeared we were making in using (1) was one we were in fact making. If we continue in this way, it quickly becomes doubtful that anything is being strictly speaking said to be so, if Grice's criterion for that is to be applied to sentences from which Travis cases can be constructed. This is good reason not to adopt this analysis of Travis cases: it commits us to hollowing out our commitments when saying that something is so, to the point of vacuity. After the axe has been wielded, in the case of (1), we would be left able to say that someone had said that that's a duck. But what is that to commit oneself to? Nothing, apparently, as Williams indicates. But then one cannot be engaging in an examination of substantial truth-conditions of the uses of the sentence in question. For that one needs it to be determinate what would count as being a duck in a sense that renders the sentence, (1), true or false. But this goes missing after the 66 axe has been swung. What one would be left with would indeed be compatible with a project of identifying only logico-syntactic features of words of a language. But in pursuing that project one would no longer be doing anything in defence of the hypothesis. 2.2 Non-standard semantic analyses The standard explanations of how a sentence can vary its truth-value across its instances do not apply to changes in truth-value exhibited in the stories of Travis cases. Non-standard semantic analyses use existing formal semantic ideas but apply them in non-standard ways. There are four examples that we will discuss: indexical predicates; hidden arguments; non-standard parameters; and ways of assigning values to parameters. 2.2.1 Indexicals Rothschild and Segal present a proposal within a truth-theoretic framework. But there is no problem representing the main thrust in our own toy semantics. In Chapter I, the valuation function in a model assigned indexicals elements of the domain D relative to a context c. Rothschild and Segal propose that the same be done with all predicates. Since predicates have intensions as their semantic values and not extensions, the valuation function should assign functions from contexts to intensions. For instance, in M1 ―sleeps‖ was assigned the following intension: F(sleeps)(wn, in) = i1 i2 i3 w1 {a, b} {a,b} {} w2 {a} {a} {} w3 {} {} {} On the current proposal, we would assign it a function from contexts to intensions. For instance: 67 F(sleeps) = f(c) = c1, i1 i2 i3 w1 {a, b} {a,b} {} w2 {a} {a} {} w3 {} {} {} c2, i1 i2 i3 w1 {a} {a} {} w2 {b} {b} {} w3 {} {} {} This semantic analysis of ―is green,‖ allows there to be changes in truth-value for our sentence (2) which are accounted for within the semantic analysis by the changes in the values of c. However, as will turn out to be a theme in these non-standard analyses, nothing specific is proposed about how the value of c is determined on given uses of the sentence. That is important. It means that we cannot test this semantic analysis by attempting to construct stories in which c is held fixed to see whether we can still elicit a change in truth-value from our sentences (1) and (2). For this reason, this proposed analysis does not show that the hypothesis is true. Rothschild and Segal are forthright about absconding responsibility: Ultimately how we succeed in communicating with indexical expressions may not be a question which formal semantics itself has much to say about. This is not to say we think that an account of this is either unimportant or easy to give. But it is not part of semantic theory. Our semantic proposal (like many other treatments of demonstratives and indexicals) isolates this complex area from formal semantics. (Rothschild and Segal 2009, p.475) Their proposal introduces us to an element of a semantic analysis that could be changing across the different stories in a Travis case. But because the proposal is 68 only partly defined, we cannot test whether this really saves the hypothesis from Travis cases. 2.2.2 Hidden arguments A similar proposal is that there is an aphonic variable within the logical form of certain, perhaps all, predicates and that this variable changes its value from story to story. Szabo works out this proposal, to some degree.80 An idiosyncrasy of Szabo's approach is his claim to have shown that only adjectives exhibit the phenomenon. This is incorrect. What he actually did was provide two example sentences for which he did not think Travis cases could be constructed. One of those two examples was the sentence, ―The number is even.‖ Supposing that this is used to speak of no more than a number, rather than a number of particular items, let's grant him this. No one is seriously supposing otherwise here. The second sentence was, ―The ring is gold‖ said of a ring made of pure gold. Such a sentence, Szabo claims, ―expresses a truth, no matter what the speaker thinks, or what the purpose of her statement is.‖81 I think this is false. I offer two counterexamples.82 First, suppose a large supply of a metal with the same chemical structure as pure gold was found on another planet. This metal is however deemed less valuable than the metal with the same chemical structure found on earth. The abundance of the stuff from the other planet makes it a cheap gift in comparison to objects made of pure gold from earth. Imagine the distraught scenes that might follow if it were discovered by a lover that the ring she had been given was not made of Earthian gold but rather from the easily available and dead-cheap foreign gold. If he said ―the ring is gold,‖ she may well deem this false.83 Another example. It is possible to apply a laser to metal (including gold) and thereby change the metal's colour without changing its 80 (Szabo 2001) 81 (Szabo 2001, p.125) 82 For a fourth see (Longworth forthcoming) 83 It is not as though there are no real cases much like this. In some parts of Asia it is possible to purchase suits, for instance, which are made by those working in factories that mass produce, say, Gucci suits, from the same materials, but which are sold outside the factories themselves, and so not via the company whose name they bear. Does such an item of clothing fall within the extension of  Gucci suit'? There's room for debate. For some purposes one might say, ―yes, what a bargain,‖ in others one might say, ―no, it's a counterfeit.‖ 69 chemical structure.84 Now suppose that one goes to a pawn shop and tries selling the ring. Once the process had been explained, one could truly say, ―The ring is gold.‖ But suppose that one is using the ring as a prop in a film where a gold ring has been requested. Then one may speak falsely in saying, ―The ring is gold.‖ These are my examples. Travis considers some others of his own.85 Because such examples are possible, I do not accept Szabo's contention that Travis cases cannot be constructed for ―the ring is gold‖ said of a ring made of pure gold. As for Szabo's contention that the phenomenon is limited to adjectives (a contention that he simply never defends in his paper), there are counterexamples to that as well.86 For instance, suppose John lost his legs years ago and now has automated legs which take him to where he wants to go with the aid of GPS guidance system. The resulting movement works but is not the natural glide of the average pedestrian. Suppose that John's mother visits John at the hospital. John gets up from his bed and moves his legs in a motion that propels him across the room. She says, ―Wow. John is walking. He is actually walking.‖ What she says is true. Suppose at the same time, a student and her supervisor walk past. She is in need of subjects for her research project. The project examines a cellular process that occurs in one's legs when walking. The supervisor says, ―what about him, he's walking.‖ They inspect John more closely only to realise that, he has no legs: he can't walk. What the supervisor said was false. Leaving this idiosyncrasy aside, Szabo's proposal in general is that adjectives are incomplete in that they have free variables in their proper semantic analysis. Szabo gives us several illustrations, one of which is for ―green.‖ He proposes that ―green‖s proper semantic analysis has two free variables: one for a comparison class, C, and one for a place at which the greenness is supposed to be, P. This can be written as: 9) CP(is green (C)(P)) Intuitively, if (9) gave the logical form of ―is green‖ then it would require supplementing with values for the variables C and P before becoming a Vi, upon 84 http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/02/080201090845.htm. I am assuming that this process does not change the chemical structure of the metals to which it is applied. But if the process does do that, suppose it didn't. 85 (Travis 1975, p.71) 86 (Szabo 2001, p.138) 70 which, semantic analysis like that in our toy semantics could be pursued. To handle (9) properly I would need to introduce type theory and lambda conversion into our toy semantics which would require taking a different approach to the semantic rules to that which I took in Chapter I. Though this would not change anything essential, the extra complexity that would result is not warranted by only this example. So I am not going to introduce such things. But to give some indication of the idea behind (9), (9) is not dissimilar from proposing that ―green‖ always has aphonic prepositional phrases associated with it. It is as though ―is green‖ is always short for ―is green for the P of a C‖ where the P is a part of the object referred to by the NP to which ―is green‖ is concatenated and the C is a class of things with which the referent of the NP is being compared. The notion of a comparison class is broad. In principle, any collection of items could form a comparison class: the class the members of which are that to which a given item is to be compared for relative greenness, for instance. Nothing is said about how the proper comparison class for a given use of an adjective is to be determined. For this reason, we cannot test Szabo's proposal to see whether something of its shape really does eliminate unaccounted-for changes in truth-value. What about the location variable? Similar problems arise for that too. Consider objects which when rotated very fast, appear a certain colour, for instance green, because the colours on their parts blend to human sight. Now consider two scenarios. In the first, we are trying to find the best ride at the fair, the one with the green cylinders. One might point at the spinning objects that are in fact painted yellow and blue, and say, ―there are the green one's, it's over there.‖ What one says is true. But in another scenario one is packing up the fair-rides. Someone asks for the green cylinders. You point to a spinning blue and yellow painted cylinder and say, ―there's one. It's green.‖ What you say is false even though you speak of the same object as before where the only difference is that before it was moving and now it is not. Thus Travis cases could be constructed for the colour of items on their surface because there is a question as to what is to count as being on the surface. Because Travis cases can be constructed for matters of location nothing is really gained, so far as specificity is concerned, by adding this parameter alongside the comparison class parameter. So as with Rothschild and Segal, Szabo's proposal is too unspecific to test. Szabo needs to show Travis cases could not be constructed for sentences given his semantic analysis. He does not do that. 71 2.2.3 Non-standard parameters Both of the previous two non-standard semantic analyses were proposals to the effect that the extension of an expression changes with a context just as has been proposed happens with indexicals. With Rothschild and Segal predicates themselves were treated as indexicals; with Szabo there were invisible appendages that behave like indexicals. A different variety of non-standard semantic analysis focuses on the parameters in the analysis, like w and i. MacFarlane has proposed that there might be non-standard parameters which we could add to w, i, and c.87 For instance, we could add one for ways of being green, call it b. Its values would presumably be drawn from a set, B. The valuation function F in a model would assign the expression, ―are green‖ an intension that takes as one of its arguments, as well as w and i, b. b is different from w and i in that it can change its value with the circumstances in which ―is green‖ is spoken without there being any change in the values of w and i. In this way we have an element of the semantic analysis of ―The leaves are green‖ which changes across the different stories of a Travis case. So we can maintain that there are long regularities in the substantial truth-conditions of sentences as described by a formal semantics. Precisely the same can be said for this proposal as has been said for the previous two. Nothing specific has been said about how to individuate ways of being green and how the value of b is determined across different occasions on which ―are green‖ is instanced. Insofar as that is the case, there is no way to go about trying to test whether this proposal has indeed eliminated Travis cases and hence shown that the hypothesis does not face trouble from them. 2.2.4 Ways of assigning values to parameters A similar but distinct proposal to MacFarlane's can be found in Predelli's work. There are two versions of Predelli's proposal. In Predelli's paper, he distinguishes between the possible world parameter w and a worldly condition which corresponds to a value for that parameter.88 He proposes that factors can influence which worldly condition corresponds to which value of the possible world parameter. 87 (MacFarlane 2007) 88 (Predelli 2005a) 72 Variation in which worldly condition was so for which value of w would mean that there could be variation in the truth-value of a sentence across different utterances of it despite no change in any element of the analysis. So suppose we have I([S [NP Ralph] [Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g where in our model we have, F(sleeps)<w1, i1> = {a,b} and F(Ralph)<w1,i1> = a. Recall that semantic rule (c) is: c. I([s NP Pred])M,w,i,c,g = 1 iff I(NP)M,w,i,c,g  I(Pred)M,w,i,c,g and 0 otherwise. So then, applying the relevant rules we get: I([S [NP Ralph] [Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g = 1. But there is the question: how does the world have to be for w to have the value w1? Predelli's proposal is that this (whatever it is) could shift across uses of the sentence and if it shifted then there could be changes in whether, the world being as it is, w has the value w1. If it changed, then there could be changes in the truthvalue of ―Ralph sleeps‖ across its instances without changes in w or i. Here there are no new parameters, just the same old w, i, and c. But what counts as it being w1 or w2 or etc. changes with the circumstances of instancing ―are green.‖ This might look like acceptance of the hypothesis' falsity. Being an opponent of the hypothesis, and being in want of a comrade, I wish Predelli had stopped here. But he does not. He proposes that there are functions from worldly conditions to parameter values which he calls ―applications.‖ Let us run through an illustration. One application might be, application 1: <worldly condition 1, parameter value w1> <worldly condition 3, parameter value w3> Whereas another application might be application 2: <worldly condition 3, parameter value w1> <worldly condition 1, parameter value w2> Suppose application 1 obtains and worldly condition 1 obtains. Then, I([S [NP Ralph] [Pred sleeps]])M1,w1,i,c,g = 1. But if application 2 obtains and world condition 1 obtains then I([S [NP Ralph] [Pred sleeps]])M1,w1,i,c,g = 0. Predelli proposes that further factors determine which application is in play when an expression is uttered. Whether how applications are determined (what worldly 73 conditions have to obtain for, for instance, application 1 one to obtain) is subject to the same kind of variation as is the value of w, is a matter on which Predelli stays equivocal. But if there is not supposed to be that variation, then, Predelli is protecting the hypothesis against Travis cases with his proposal. Things are slightly but significantly different in Predelli's book. There, talk of applications has been abandoned entirely.89 Instead Predelli proposes that Travis cases show only that whatever intension is proposed for a given expression, e.g. ―green,‖ there must be different values for parameter w for each story in a Travis case.90 This proposal is little different from MacFarlane's. Whereas MacFarlane introduces additional parameters, Predelli is more economical. How do such proposals stand as accounts of the truth-value shift in Travis cases? If Predelli's paper is read as not proposing that the factors determining the right application are canonical, then the proposal there is not in opposition to OS. If it is read as proposing canonical factors, then it is. The proposal of the book does appear to be an attempt to shore up the hypothesis. In each case, insofar as he is, as with the previous two non-standard analyses, there is not enough specificity given to how either the applications, or the values of the possible world parameter, are determined on given uses of sentences. The spirit in which Predelli offers both his proposals should be noted. Each is presented just to show that it can be done. But he also presents a minimal view of the job description of formal semantics, and as Predelli is himself aware, on that view there is no need to make the proposals Predelli makes. 2.3 Stalemate This leaves us at a stalemate: the dispute over the hypothesis cannot be resolved by appealing to the data likely to be considered for the proposals made. Given the incompleteness of these proposals, linguistic data cannot be used to argue for or against the hypothesis because we do not know what data would count for or against the hypothesis. We need more specificity but we are not likely to get it: the sentiment of those attempting to defend the hypothesis is that specificity's provision is not their responsibility. So long as this is so, the stalemate is chronic. 89 It was dropped because readers of the paper falsely thought that an application was a further parameter. (Predelli, p.c.) 90 (Predelli 2005, p.148) 74 2.3.1 Bad methodology: the accusation One way out of the stalemate is to identify rotten methodology in the work of a disputant: those philosophers who are making the unspecific proposals are engaging in bad methodology. The data as so far surveyed do not support the hypothesis. So there is no reason to even have proposed the hypothesis in the first place because in doing that one can be doing little more than guessing. Instead of guessing what is to be found in the behaviour of words, we should engage in a patient botany of linguistic data and build our hypotheses from the findings of such fieldwork. This sentiment is common in Travis' writings. It is the basis upon which the whole of his 1975 is written, itself a documentation of fieldwork conducted in accordance with a given methodology: ...begin by formulating a set of systematic descriptions of what we say, reflecting as well as possible our intuitions about what we say. On this approach, the search for primary units of analysis, the adoption of criteria of meaning and the search for necessary and sufficient conditions are all to be put off until we are quite sure we understand what it is that we do say. (Travis 1975, p.x). This (or a similar) methodological principle is espoused in subsequent publications.91 Travis does not discuss the proposals of Szabo, Rothschild and Segal, MacFarlane, or Predelli. But when discussing their antecedents (viz. Lewis and Kaplan),92 Travis dismisses what is common to them as an attempt to guess at what might be the case before simply having a good look, i.e. producing hypotheses which wildly overreach what data there is to support them. If that really is a mistake on their part, then we have a way out of the stalemate: their schematic proposals should not be argued with but instead simply ignored. 2.3.2 Bad methodology: a false accusation Is it true that to formulate a hypothesis and then attempt to collect data which operate in accordance with it, a sin of inquiry? No. As post-1960 developments in the philosophy of science would suggest, good Popperians are not good inquirers. It is a mainstay of inquiry that while observations made may be counterexamples or 91 See (Travis 1978, p.401), (Travis 1981, pp.1-2), and (Travis 2008, p.1) 92 They are antecedents with respect to their attempt to shore up the hypothesis by means of non-standard semantic analyses. 75 counterevidence to particular hypotheses about a subject matter, they may also be artefacts of the way in which the data were collected. For example, sociologist Michael Lynch reports in the write-up of his 2 year study of work done in a laboratory, the phenomenon of ―negative artifacts‖: things which are expected to be there, but which are not found. The possibility that an experiment, the implementation of theory, was done badly, rather than that the theory implemented was found to be conclusively false, is always present: When the experiment failed to work, the question remained: ―Did we do it correctly? Is there anything we could have done that would have made it work?‖ (Lynch 1985, p.114) Because of this, it is not unreasonable to expect scientists to pursue a hypothesis despite what might be evidence that it is false, because that ―evidence‖ might also arise from defective methodology. Fugelsang et al. report upon how scientists at ―three leading molecular biology laboratories at a prominent US university‖ reacted to results that do not conform to their predictions. They write: ...scientists developed causal explanations for the inconsistent findings. These causal explanations could be classified into one of two types: (1) methodological or (2) theoretical. The predominant strategy, which occurred for 196 of the 223 inconsistent findings, was to blame the method used in the experiment... The finding that 12% (27 out of 223) of initial observations of inconsistent findings resulted in theory modification is indicative of a conservative strategy for theory change. Post laboratory meeting interviews suggest that the use of this strategy is based largely on the researchers' knowledge of the high base rate of experimental methodological error. (Fugelsang 2004, p.88) Again, given the similarity in appearance of falsity and bad implementation, it is not unreasonable that scientists do this. We find in the actions of scientists (who certainly form one exemplar of the good inquirer) good reason to believe that it is not bad methodology to ―run with‖ the hypothesis despite the falsification of some versions of it. To object that this is, in itself, a bad method is a bad line of criticism. It presupposes a dubious conception of the role of hypotheses in well-conducted empirical inquiry. So the stalemate cannot be resolved so easily. 76 3 Wittgenstein 1989 Travis presents an argument that attacks what he there calls a classical semantics.93 If the argument were successful it would establish that the hypothesis is false. In what follows I will summarise the argument as perspicuously and accurately as I can before considering whether it establishes that the hypothesis is false. 3.1 Preliminaries Travis presents the argument as about semantic items. We are concerned only with one variety of semantic item viz. linguistic expressions. So I will couch the argument in these more familiar terms. A linguistic expression can have various properties. These include but are not exhausted by: meaning A, saying A to be B, calling A (a) B, saying what is true, saying what would be true of situation A, being true/false, being true of A.94 Travis calls these ―semantic properties.‖ One might think that there are some semantic properties such that for an expression that has them, given ―the other facts of that occasion‖ of some instancing of the expression, the semantic properties that the expression has are determined on that occasion.95 Travis calls semantic properties that do this determining ―critical semantic properties.‖ We can recast this in terms familiar from our toy semantics. If there are long regularities in the substantial truth conditions of a sentence (as modelled by a formal semantics for the sentence), then the expressions that constitute the sentence have intensions (or more generally, semantic values) associated with them for every instance of them for a certain duration of time (roughly, the lifetime of a speaker). Intensions thus understood are such that, combined with ―other facts of that occasion‖ on which the expressions are used, they determine some of what Travis is calling ―semantic properties.‖ We can boil the particular semantic properties that are determined down to: the referents of referring expressions, the satisfiers of predicates, and the truth-conditions of a sentence (all understood substantially); or generally, to the extensions of linguistic expressions. Hence, the proposal that there are long regularities in the substantial truth-conditions 93 See (Travis 1989). The strategy of the book and the broad structure of the argument are outlined on (Travis 1989, p.xi, pp.1-2, p.75) 94 (Travis 1989, pp.3-4) 95 (Travis 1989, p.10) 77 (satisfiers and referents) of sentences (predicates and referring expressions) is to propose that linguistic expressions have what Travis calls a ―critical semantics‖: properties (i.e. intensions) which determine, for any instance of the linguistic expressions (at least within the span of a long longevity), what their referents, satisfiers, or truth-conditions (i.e. extensions) are. For ease of reference let us use the word ―meaning‖ to speak of semantic properties of linguistic expressions which are invariant for a long longevity.96 The target of the book is a view that is broader than the view that there are critical semantic properties of linguistic expressions. What is at issue is this. Let ―O‖ be a variable which ranges over ways of having semantics. This could be over different times, or places, or whatever other factor one might care to introduce. This could even include circumstances in which an expression is used in some way but not by its author.97 Travis' target is the view that once O is held constant, there cannot be changes in the semantic properties of an expression. On such a view we say that the semantics of the expression is classical. Notice that if a semantics is critical then it is classical. This is because then one would be proposing that if one fixes some semantic properties of an expression, and some further facts, then the expression must have certain other semantic properties. Hence, one is supposing that there is some way of having a semantics, viz. being such that the expression has given semantic properties while certain further facts obtain, such that, it is not possible to get the expression to shift in those semantic properties not yet held fixed. So if there is not a classical semantics, there will not be a critical semantics either.98 Finally, a semantic property of an expression is to be called ―s-use sensitive‖ if on different occasions, O, (in the very broad sense just introduced), there are changes in the semantics of the expression.99 96 Thus put, there is a genuine question as to whether intensions are part of the meaning of linguistic expressions. 97 For examples of this kind of variation in semantic properties see (Travis 1989, pp.31-32). For more recent discussion of this kind of possibility see (MacFarlane manuscript). 98 See (Travis 1989, p.21) 99 The expression is first introduced on (Travis 1989, pp.18-19). The version I state here appears on (Travis 1989, p.31). 78 3.2 The public access principle: a model of the constitution of semantic fact Travis introduces a model of how semantic properties are constituted. For something to be a semantic property (e.g. extension or intension), P, of an expression, just is for ―it to be so that a reasonable (informed) judge would take it to have P. Similarly, it [the expression] counts as having P just where a reasonable judge would so react to it.‖100 So according to this model, the properties that linguistic expressions have are had because judges (which will include speakers) treat them as having them. That in itself appears to be an almost uncontroversial idea. Suppose some kids are playing football in the street. Two lampposts become goalposts. We cannot separate that they are goalposts from the kids' treatment of the lampposts as goalposts for the purposes of their game. There is nothing about the lampposts which makes them goalposts independently of the way the kids are then treating the lampposts. Similarly, on the model, that ―red‖ means red cannot be separated from the treatment given ―red‖ by (reasonable and informed) speakers of English. There are two enrichments of this model that need noting. First, a reasonable judge's reactions can be wrong.101 It is not the case that the semantic facts are just what some particular reasonable judge or judges take them to be. The properties of expressions depend for being possessed, ―on the reactions an indefinite number and an indefinite collection of judges would have to other facts, in situations in which those facts might count as obtaining or not.‖102 The ―indefinite collection‖ means that for an expression to have a property, its having or not having it must be something there is that one does not have to be any particular individual to recognise.103 In our football example, it is not the case that something counts as a goalpost just because some particular individual or circle of individuals reckons it is. Every player can be mistaken about this. This condition on an expression's having a given property is called the public access principle: an expression's having the semantic properties it has just is for an indefinite number of reasonable, 100 (Travis 1989, p.48) 101 (Travis 1989, pp.45-47) 102 (Travis 1989, p.58, see also pp.74-75) 103 The model is therefore incompatible with those who adopt a community response to Wittgenstein's rule following considerations. That response has it that expressions have the semantic properties they do because a particular group of people take them to be so. That is not the current idea. 79 informed, judges to react to it as having such. Second, if reasonable judges' reactions to the expression matter to what properties it has in the way described by this model, then whether the judges doubt that the expression has a given property will be relevant to whether it has that property. Travis distinguishes between two varieties of doubt: a real doubt and a conceivable doubt.104 One might conceive of various facts that could obtain, which, if they were to obtain, would show that one is not doing as one appears to be doing right now. You might suppose that it is night instead of day. That is a matter of what one can conceive. But that is a very different matter from finding it difficult to believe (so doubting) that it is day. The reactions of reasonable judges, whether they take some expression to have some semantic property, will depend upon what they can doubt in the real sense, not in the conceivable sense. I will henceforth speak of the (enriched) public access principle rather than the model and by this I will mean the trio of claims just outlined: the judge/speaker dependence of semantic properties; that the judges/speakers in question are not any particular judges or speakers; and that the reaction of judges/speakers depend in part on what they can doubt in the real sense. The significance of meeting the conditions laid down by the enriched public access principle is this. For an expression that can have semantic properties, it is always possible that one reasonable and informed judge take it to possess a given semantic property while another reasonable and informed judge takes the same expression to not possess the semantic property, where neither judge has made a mistake. At least, if there is nothing more to the expressions having the two properties than the judgements of reasonable and informed judges, this is not ruled out.105 Semantic properties of expressions constituted in this way are in principle open to such variation. Hence, expressions with semantic properties so constituted are in principle s-use sensitive because this is all that is required to be that. Hence, they are not classical. Hence, for expressions and semantic properties that conform to this model, there are no critical semantic properties. 104 (Travis 1989, pp.49-50) 105 (Travis 1989, pp.65-66, p.339) 80 3.3 The ontological argument The ontological argument has the conclusion that there are no semantic facts.106 Travis proposes that the model of the constitution of semantic facts described by the enriched public access principle renders the ontological argument unsound. That is presented as reason to adopt the model. But the model is inconsistent with classical semantics. Hence the classical view is incorrect. Here is the ontological argument. Suppose that a given expression, e.g. ―gronch‖, has the property of being true of some item, V. The word alone does not make this so. There must be some other facts (we will call them basing facts) which make that purported fact so, or in virtue of which it is so. Call this the demand.107 Two principles are then adopted: Principle 1: if it is conceivable that for a given fact F that it should hold while it is not the case that ―gronch‖ is true of V, then, F does not meet the demand. Principle 2: if there are no facts F that meet the demand, then it is not a fact that ―gronch‖ is true of V. The first principle is a familiar kind of principle. For instance, one might argue that if it is conceivable that there could be a fully functioning creature which has no gustatory sensations, then gustatory sensations are not constituted by anything about the fully functioning creature. There are obvious problems with this kind of principle which I will turn to when evaluating this argument. For the sake of argument, let those problems slide. The second principle is not (too) controversial, if all the rest is granted. The trouble is then supposed to be that it is always conceivable that the base fact obtain while the expression does not possess the semantic property in question: ...for the sorts of facts we normally recognize to obtain or not, [there is no] withstanding the requirement imposed by [the ontological argument] on other facts: that their obtaining leaves it inconceivable that the fact in question should fail to obtain. (Travis 1989, p.344) 106 See (Travis 1989, pp.343-344) 107 (Travis 1989, p.343, p.360) 81 If this can be granted then, given principle 2, and contrary to our supposition, ―gronch‖ does not have the property of being true of V. If there is nothing special about ―gronch‖ and the semantic property of being made true by V, then we can generalise to all expressions and semantic properties. If so, then the ontological argument if sound has the conclusion that there are no facts of the sort wherein expressions have semantic properties. However, if the enriched public access principle is granted then the ontological argument is unsound. The ontological argument rests upon the assumption that if there are conceivable circumstances in which some basing fact obtains and the pertinent semantic fact does not, then the candidate basing fact is not really a basing fact. But suppose the enriched public access principle is true. Then semantic facts are constituted by the reactions of reasonable judges. These reactions will be constrained by ―genuine‖ doubts about the semantic properties of expressions, and hence, a merely conceivable circumstance in which the basing fact obtains without the expression having the semantic property will be irrelevant to whether, as things actually are, the candidate basing fact is indeed a basing fact of the semantic property's possession by the expression.108 But then principle 1 would be false and the ontological argument would be unsound. That a derivation of an ontological falsehood about semantic properties is blocked by the enriched public access principle is a reason in favour of accepting that principle. We have here a kind of transcendental argument for the principle. How does this bear upon the hypothesis? If we adopt the hypothesis, then the meaning of an expression includes an intension. An intension determines what the referents, satisfiers, or truth-conditions are of any instance of a linguistic expression. If the conclusion of Travis' argument is granted, then there is reason to doubt that the meaning of an expression (that which is constant to any instance of it) could include an intension. Given it, we should adopt the enriched public access principle. But then whether a given expression has, for instance, the semantic property being true, will be s-use sensitive. But then an intension cannot be part of the meaning of an expression. Hence, there cannot be long regularities in the substantial truth-conditions of expressions, for that just is for an intension, substantially understood, to be part of the meaning of an expression. 108 (Travis 1989, pp.346-347) 82 There are more twists and turns in Travis' argument than I have presented. There are two that I will mention but not discuss. Firstly, rather than employing the enriched public access principle per se, a special case is employed as applied to fact stating discourse.109 This special case can be stated as: ...semantic facts, such as the facts as to whether some predicate, W, says what is true of some item, V, are what they would most reasonably be taken to be, on the supposition that there are semantic facts at all. (Travis 1989, p.346) The distinction between merely conceivable and genuine doubts has its analogue in a contrast between what can happen so far as conceivable circumstances go, and, what would most reasonably be taken to be so. In the same way genuine doubts are more discriminating than conceivable doubts, so too what it is reasonable to take to be so is more discriminating than what it is conceivable to take as being so. I have nonetheless presented the reply to the ontological argument in terms of doubts because that is how the enriched public access principle is described when introduced in the book. I am supposing the difference is not significant. Secondly, there is a lengthy discussion in which Travis attempts to show that the resources available to one who accepts the enriched public access principle for resisting the ontological argument are not available to someone who does not accept the enriched public access principle. This discussion divides into two parts. The first considers one who attempts to draw the mere/genuine doubt distinction without appealing to what a reasonable judge would take to be so.110 It is argued that the distinction cannot be made without recourse to how a reasonable judge would react. The second considers whether one could resist the ontological argument without invoking that distinction.111 It is argued that there is no way to do this. The criticisms I raise do not concern whether there need be reasonable judges' judgements involved in blocking the ontological argument. For this reason we do not need to engage with these rather complex discussions. 109 (Travis 1989, pp.304-305) 110 (Travis 1989, pp.345-372) 111 (Travis 1989, pp.372-281) 83 3.4 Discussion of the argument I do not think Travis' argument is satisfactory as used against the hypothesis. I will first pose an unsuccessful complaint against principle 1. I will then turn to a fatal objection to the argument (as employed to argue against the hypothesis). First, the complaint. The ontological argument requires that the demand be met by citing facts for which it is not conceivable that they obtain without the semantic fact obtaining. Should we be using conceivability as a measure of what is so? Certainly for many kinds of thing it is doubtful that we should. That I can conceive of my lamp lighting a room without any electricity does not mean that my lamp lights rooms without electricity. Similarly, one might argue, that I can conceive of a linguistic expression being satisfied by a given item does not mean that it is satisfied by that item. If so, then the ontological argument breaks down without appeal to the enriched public access principle. However, when considering what the satisfiers are of a given expression, ―red‖ say, what more does one have to go on than how one can conceive of using that expression (correctly)? Not much, is a reasonable answer. This is the kind of thing we should be thinking of when examining what the satisfiers are of ―gronch.‖ But then we can reply to the complaint by saying that conceivability has a special role in deciding properties of linguistic expressions in a way that it lacks in deciding the properties of other things (like my lamp, for instance). There is obviously room for a debate here. To what extent are speakers' intuitions about how a word can be used a way to study words? But I do not want to enter that. All that I want to establish is that the prima facie bite of this complaint is lost when we consider the kinds of item to which the demand and principle 1 are being applied. One might worry that the enriched public access principle is now being used to defend principle 1. If it was, adoption of it would be part of what generates the sceptical conclusion, so a thoroughgoing rejection of that principle would also be a way to avoid the conclusion of the ontological argument. That may be so. However, two points. Firstly, insofar as a role of the conceivable (in some sense) is reasonable for the semantic properties of linguistic expressions, this move is unreasonable. Secondly, if we are already committed to that much then what is left open in the current defence of principle 1 is how this ―conceivability‖ is to be understood. It is that for which adoption or rejection of the enriched public access principle is consequential. 84 Now for what I think is a more problematic objection. Does the s-use sensitivity of linguistic expressions follow from a view of the constitution of semantic fact in which reasonable judges' judgements are so central? That depends upon whether the involvement of such judgements entails s-use sensitivity. The definition of classical semantics concerns whether it is possible for there to be variation in the semantic properties of a linguistic expression across occasions (in the broad sense introduced earlier). The involvement of the reactions of reasonable (informed) judges in the constitution of the semantic properties of linguistic expressions might well commit us to it being possible that there is this sort of variation but that commits us to only the possibility of s-use sensitivity. Although it is true that if a linguistic expression has its semantic properties s-use sensitively then it does not have them classically, it is not true that if the semantic properties do not have them classically then they do have them s-use sensitively. So even if Travis' transcendental argument is sound, it does not establish the conclusion that the semantic properties of linguistic expressions are s-use sensitive. Hence, it does not show that semantic properties are not critical. Hence, it does not show that the hypothesis is false. Consider an analogy. There are such things as people capable of detecting various features of the manufacturing history of a wine by tasting the wine. They have come to learn of certain relations between how the wine tastes to them and the history of the substance they taste. They may well use certain expressions in a way which reflects the regularity there has come to be in the judgements of the history of these substances. If so, then we have a case in which there is a role for the good judgement of the wine tasters in whether, for instance, certain uses of expressions are to be classified as true, or false, but where there is a regularity in these judgements, one that does not fluctuate with the occasion. There is a role for judgement in the classification of expressions employed in describing such objects. But I can see no reason to think this requires us, as a consequence, to deny that the semantics of linguistic expressions are critical. Hence it does not force us to deny that they exhibit a long regularity in their substantial truth-conditions which could be documented within a theory that took the form of a formal semantics. A subsidiary point is this. It is variation in the reactions of reasonable informed judges that is supposed to introduce the possibility of variation in semantic properties of linguistic expressions across occasions. But that sounds much like a 85 kind of variation we would have expected anyway; what we could call ―the noise in a convention.‖ Suppose there is a convention that everyone walk on a given side of the pavement when walking north, and the other, when walking south. Everyone would expect there to be some delinquent walkers. Similarly, in the use of expressions one would expect similar such fluctuations. If so, the variation Travis argues is possible is not controversial. It is known of and thought damaging. For that reason, it would not be a good ally in arguing that the semantic properties of linguistic expressions ―should be S-use sensitive.‖112 4 Wittgenstein 2006 Travis offers a third argument which may prove useful in attacking the hypothesis.113 The argument targets what he calls a Fregean view of the meaning of predicates. ―Fregean‖ is just a label for a view one might have about the meaning of predicates, with consequences for the truth-conditions of sentences. The focus on predicates as opposed to other expressions is incidental: in chapter 2 of this book Travis argues for a similar thesis for referring NPs, though he does this with a different argument which I will not discuss here. I will assume in this section that the hypothesis has been abandoned for referring NPs. As before, by ―meaning‖ I shall mean a constant feature of a predicate across different instances of it. The question is whether such a thing determines the predicate's extension across all those instances. After presenting the argument I will argue that it does not support the falsity of the hypothesis. 4.1 Preliminaries A target of this book is a view of predicates according to which a predicate's meaning is a function from objects in certain conditions to truth-values. The meaning of a predicate, on the targeted view, is supposed to be something such that given an object in a given condition, the meaning makes it fully determinate whether a sentence formed using that predicate and an expression that refers to that object is true or false.114 Why are the functions functions from objects-in-certain-conditions rather than simply objects? Objects are not such that they necessarily have a given property or 112 (Travis 1989, p.30) 113 (Travis 2006) 114 (Travis 2006, pp.36-37, pp.119-122) 86 such that they necessarily do not have a given property. Objects when in some conditions are such that they have a given property and when in other conditions are such that they do not have that property. So if the function that is the meaning of a predicate is a particular function from objects to truth values, then, so far as that object is concerned, the predicate ―is blue‖ could not be the English ―is blue‖; it would be satisfied only by objects which are necessarily blue. Hence, instead of the arguments to these functions being objects, they are objects' conditions; ―conditions,‖ that is, in a certain sense. Compare, a condition on your entry to the country is that you are not a terrorist, with, what condition was he in when you found him? The former notion of condition is akin to ―requirement.‖ The latter is not. The notion of condition that Travis employs here is the latter, which he glosses as a thing's being as it is.115 Objects can be the objects they are while changing condition. An object might be in one condition on Tuesday and another on Wednesday. Instead of having objects as arguments, the function has objects-inconditions as arguments. Thus the fact that an object can change the condition it is in without changing what object it is can be registered by the meaning of the predicate, on this view, the function. The relativisation to days is merely illustrative. These objects-in-conditions are to be such that it is not possible for a predicate to have more than one truth-value when concatenated with an NP that has that object-in-given-condition as its referent.116 Let us call this view of predicates the Fregean view.117 If the Fregean view of the meaning of predicates were to hold of natural language predicates then there would be a long regularity in the substantial extensions of predicates: the hypothesis would be true. In principle one could construct a theory in the form of a formal semantics which describes this regularity. In our toy formal semantics we represented this using intensions. Intensions for predicates are functions from objects in given conditions (viz. values for w and i and whatever else), to truth-values. So to suppose that a formal semantic analysis describes a long regularity in the substantial extension of a predicate could be understood as adoption of the Fregean view of the meaning of predicates. If so, then an argument 115 (Travis 2006, pp.36-37) 116 (Travis 2006, p.36) 117 (Travis 2006, pp.36-37). 87 against the Fregean view would be an argument against the hypothesis as it applies to predicates.118 4.2 The argument The structure of the argument is this: a task is described which uttered words must enable if they are to be (in our terms, substantially) truth-evaluable. The Fregean view is committed to a particular way of carrying out this task. Travis describes a constraint on the capacities of speakers and understanders of uttered words. Given this constraint, if the meanings of predicates were Fregean then speakers and understanders of uttered words could not perform the task in question. But we can perform this task. Hence the Fregean view cannot be the correct account of how uttered words enable the task to be carried out. Telegraphically put, that is the argument. Now let us tread through it more carefully. Consider a simple sentence of a language which includes a referring NP and a predicate. To utter that sentence is to say a particular item has or does not have a given property.119 The item in question can be: (a) as is required for the sentence uttered to be true; (b) as is required for the sentence uttered to be false; (c) as is required for the sentence's truth or falsity to be left unsettled. It is not the case that only the object being precisely as it is is sufficient for the item to fall into whichever category (a)-(c) it actually falls into. There is an open ended range of differences to how the world is which would not change how the object is categorised. With each difference in the world, we can ask of the object: is it being as it is now sufficient for the object to be (a)? (or (b)? or (c)?). For instance, suppose I pour some hot water into a mug in which is located a roibos teabag. Gesturing at the mug, Patrick utters, ―this is red.‖ Gesturing at the mug before he pours, I can ask whether this is things being as Patrick said them to be. Then again as he pours. Then again as he moves over to the kitchen counter. Then again had an ant 118 This argument can be reapplied to referring NPs if one thinks they have intensions. Travis does not discuss such a view. He (2006, chapter 2) discusses the view that there is a general specification of what makes something the referent of a singular term. He poses a dilemma for such a view, escape from which (he thinks) requires rejection of the hypothesis for singular terms. I will not discuss that dilemma. However, if one were to attempt to provide a description of a long regularity of the extension(s) of a referring NP whose referents were determined by a general criterion (e.g. in circumstance c1, the criterion is satisfied by o1; in circumstance c2, the criterion is satisfied by o2...etc.), then one would have something that is not distinguishable from an intension. The current argument could be applied to such a description. 119 (Travis 2006, pp.129-130) 88 moved toward the cup. Then again, had another mug stood beside this one. And so on without end. Sometimes the correct answer will be different from what it was, sometimes not. Travis speaks of answering such questions as solving problems of translation from the claim into particular cases. Given the world is at it is, is the uttered sentence true, false, or neither?120 The uttered sentence will require determinate answers to such questions if it is to have substantial truth conditions. For this reason the translations cannot be arbitrary. Different patterns of translation for a given sentence are possible. Such differences just are different truth-conditions for the uttered sentence. Let us say that a given pattern of translations is an understanding of the uttered sentence.121 This much sets up what has to be in place for the uttered sentence to say something whose truth is determinately decided by how the world is. The predicate of the sentence contributes a pattern of translation for the object referred to by the referring expression to which the predicate is concatenated to make the sentence that was uttered. This is so no matter what explanation of the meaning of a predicate one has. The Fregean view of predicate meaning is an account of how predicates deliver a determinate pattern of translation. It is an account of the phenomenon just described. Notice two things about how it does this. First, the predicate's meaning is a ―synopsis of the solutions to indefinitely many problems; a synopsis from which all those solutions are recoverable,‖ where here the problems to be solved are translations in the already described sense.122 So for the uttered words to have different truth-conditions is for the there to be different functions that are the predicate's meaning. Second, truth-conditions can be understood and meant by speakers and hearers of sentences (uttered). On the Fregean view, meaning and understanding one truth-condition for an uttered sentence rather than another truth-condition is to stand in a relation to a function of the Fregean kind.123 120 (Travis 2006, pp.122-123, p.129) 121 (Travis 2006, p.129) 122 (Travis 2006, p.124) 123 Though Travis talks only of meaning one's words to have a given understanding, what is meant is that they have substantial truth-conditions, as we can see from how the notion of an understanding was introduced. Cf. (Travis 2006, p.119) 89 Travis proposes that there is a limitation on the thoughts one (so speakers/meaners and understanders) can have. Here he alludes back to a much earlier stage of the book. In an earlier chapter Travis discussed singular thoughts: thoughts whose truth depends upon the condition of some item in particular, rather than just any item which satisfies a general condition: There is a kind of thought that hitches its fate to some given individual in this way: according to the thought, some individual is a certain way; no matter how things were, only such-and-such individual's being that way (or not) would make, or would have made, things as thus thought...The individual that bears this burden is the one the thought is, in the singular way, about. (Travis 2006, p.42) Travis claims that singular thoughts are such that one has to be in some sense acquainted with that which it is about. All that is meant by the word ―acquainted‖ is no more than that one has a capacity to make one's thought depend upon a given individual ―in the singular way.‖124 So to have a singular thought one must be capable of making one's thought depend for its truth upon something in particular, and not just upon whatever satisfies a general condition. To mean or understand words with a given understanding (read: pattern of translations to particular cases, or, substantial truth-conditions), a meaner or understander must be able to distinguish different understandings of the words. If the understandings of the words are representations which include functions of the Fregean sort then, to distinguish different understandings words might bear, the meaner or understander must be able to distinguish such functions. But such functions relate objects in particular conditions to truth-values. To mean or understand such a function will require a capacity to have an array of singular thoughts, viz. thoughts of the form, ―this is how the uttered words said things to be‖ where the singular element, ―this,‖ will, for different argument-value pairs of the function identify different objects-in-given-conditions. For instance, if Sid says, ―Pia, your shoes are under the bed,‖ then if these uttered words have determinate substantial truth-conditions, and if they have such in the Fregean way, then the predicate ―are under the bed‖ will have a function whose 124 (Travis 2006, e.g. p.72) 90 arguments are all the objects-in-given-conditions of which translation problems can be raised, and whose values are solutions to those problems. The arguments to that function will consist of objects-in-given-conditions: this is as things were said to be; this isn't; this is as things were said not to be; etc. To mean or understand such a thing the meaner or understander must be able to have thoughts which relate objects-in-particular-conditions to truth-values. These thoughts will be singular. But now the limitation on the capacity of meaners and understanders bites. To have a singular thought one must be acquainted with that which the thought is about. But for many objects-in-given-conditions, meaners and understanders will not be acquainted with those objects. But many different functions will be distinguished only by the arguments for which meaners and understanders cannot have the appropriate singular thoughts. For instance, if Pia stands outside the closed bedroom door, then she is not acquainted with the shoes in the condition they then are in when she enters the bedroom. Therefore she cannot think the singular thoughts she needs to be able to think if, as per the Fregean view, she is to mean or understand one function rather than any other. But then, if predicate meaning were of the Fregean kind, meaners and understanders could not mean or understand the truth-conditions of uttered sentences. But they can in fact. So the Fregean view cannot be correct.125 4.3 Discussion of the argument The main objection will be exactly as it was for the 1989 argument. To begin though, let us examine some more tempting complaints. A first objection is that acquaintance can be got through testimony itself. If that were so, then why could an understander not simultaneously become acquainted with the object as she is spoken to? This is a non-sequitur. The trouble lies with acquaintance with an object in various conditions, not with an object simpliciter. For all the different questions that can be raised, ―is this things being as they were said to be?‖ there is a new thing with which to be acquainted. For most such things, neither the speaker nor the hearer will be acquainted with them. A variation on this objection is deny that a meaner or understander is not acquainted with that which the argument requires us to suppose they are not 125 This is summarised at (Travis 2006, pp.137-139) 91 acquainted. To be acquainted with something is to be in a position to make a thought of one's depend upon the condition of that something. Why is it not possible for Pia to make a thought of hers which we might express by saying that she thinks that the shoes are under the bed, depend upon how things are in the bedroom? Travis' glosses on acquaintance are not of a kind that immediately lend themselves to a denial of this. In fact, Travis refuses to make any general claims about with what someone is acquainted because such is deemed an occasionsensitive matter.126 The current objection is not with that position per se. It is with the consequence that it's just not clear that Pia is not acquainted with the condition of the shoes. It is not as though acquaintance is a capacity to report how the shoes are. It is a capacity to make one's thoughts depend upon the condition of the shoes in the singular way. A response to this objection might be to indicate that there must be many things with which one cannot at some time, make one's thoughts depend in the singular way: viz. those which do not yet exist. Travis mentions several times the case in which prior to the existence of Frege, no one could have singular thoughts about him. A reasonable supposition is that that which a singular thought is about must exist. Conditions-of-objects do not exist prior to the point at which objects are in such conditions. So there will be many, by this criterion, singular thoughts, relevant to meaning or understanding a Fregean predicate, which one cannot have. Hence, if existence is a prerequisite for singular thought, then the argument cannot be faulted on the current lines. Secondly, we have had to suppose that there are situations such that A understands the truth-conditions of an uttered sentence and wherein those truthconditions are distinct from other truth-conditions the uttered sentence could have had, that diverge for objects-in-conditions with which A is not acquainted. We could bite this bullet: of course, for circumstances with which A is not acquainted, A cannot at that time distinguish between different claims that might have been made. But that does not matter so long as in any given moment, A understands whether things being as they are then requires the truth or falsity of the sentence. The trouble with this response is that, insofar as it is not just an example of the third objection, it forfeits the Fregean view and so is not really opposed to the conclusion of the argument. It forfeits the Fregean view because it leaves a role for something like good judgement in recognising what the truth-conditions are of an 126 (Travis 2006, pp.60-70) 92 uttered sentence. But it is precisely the point of the Fregean view of predicate meaning that there be no place for such good judgement. Thirdly, one might object that there are unnecessary anti-realist commitments being pushed upon the Fregean. Here we should be careful. What is true is that there is a manifestability constraint on what a good candidate for the meaning of a predicate could be. The argument involves moves from meaners and understanders not being capable of recognising the truth-conditions of uttered sentences on the Fregean model to the Fregean model being a bad model of the meaning of predicates in such uttered sentences. Such a move is fine, I think, provided it really is true (which it is) that meaners and understanders can mean and understand the truth-conditions of uttered sentences. However, what is not being proposed is that the meaning of predicates must therefore be in some way curtailed to fall within the epistemic capacities of the meaners and understanders. On the contrary, it is being supposed that such a move is unacceptable, and because of this, the argument gets the conclusion against the Fregean view. One could maintain the Fregean view but curtail the meaning of a predicate so that it falls within the epistemic reach of meaners and understanders. Such a move would warrant the title ―anti-realism.‖ This is perhaps a way to put a Dummettian response to this kind of predicament. But Travis is unwilling to accept such a position for much the same reason that McDowell does not accept such a position.127 What you would have left would not really be substantial truth-conditions at all. For this would be to commit to no determinate verdict for the vast majority of translation problems to particular cases. That is to make no commitment at all in meaning such and such by one's words, or understanding such and such by someone's words. The view here is in a sense then decidedly not anti-realist, despite its respect for the epistemic limitations of meaners and understanders. The most forceful objection to the hope that we have here an argument against the hypothesis takes the following simple form. The conclusion Travis draws from the argument is that the Fregean view is false. The alternative he places in its stead is that we exercise a sensibility which is not exhaustively characterisable as a Fregean function would. The trouble is that there is a disparity between, on the one hand, whether or not meaners and understanders are acquainted with items in 127 (McDowell 1984) 93 various conditions, and on the other hand, whether there is any pattern to be documented in the satisfiers of predicates as used by speakers of a linguistic community. Just because such a pattern, were there one, could not be explained by appealing solely to that which meaners and understanders are acquainted, does not mean there cannot be such a regularity. To conclude that the hypothesis is false, on this sort of basis, we need a further assumption to the effect that reliance on a sensibility in meaning and understanding sentences entails the kind of variation that would falsify the hypothesis. Travis does not provide any support for such an assumption. As with the 1989 argument, there is also a corollary: insofar as one does think that the involvement of a sensibility in meaning and understanding sentences requires an absence of such a regularity, there is the danger that this variation arises from the ―noise in a convention‖ and so is not something that is even unexpected. 5 Conclusion Travis does not offer a compelling argument against the hypothesis. I am sympathetic to the argument from cases. The versatility of linguistic expressions poses a compelling challenge to those who think there is any pattern to be found in the variation of extension there exhibited. The trouble is that such an argument cannot pose a threat to hypotheses that are too incomplete to test and as I have argued (pace Travis) the mere fact that these are hypotheses are not yet supported by evidence is not in itself a reason to avoid making them. As for the Wittgensteinian arguments, they may well have had a task set for them other than that of bulldozing the hypothesis. So perhaps it is unreasonable of me to have expected them to show that the hypothesis is false. Nonetheless, I thought it worth investigating whether they could do the job and I have presented the results of that investigation. They each have the conclusion, insofar as they are sound, that there is an inherent involvement of sensibility in one's operation of linguistic expressions. But no reason has been given for thinking that the involvement of sensibility excludes there being documentable regularities of the pertinent sort. 94 C H A P T E R I I I Hempel and the empiricist construal of theories and their application 1 Introduction In the next chapter I want to show that OS has a purpose (or more specifically, that it is a consequence of a purpose being fulfilled). If one were to remove it from natural language the loss would be as serious as would be the loss of phonology or grammar. To do this we will proceed in two stages. In the first stage, which is pursued in the current chapter, I will present a proposal from a late paper by Carl Hempel in which he rejected a view of theories and their use to make predictions. According to the view, theories contain their own application criteria. Hempel gave reason to doubt this.128 I will describe the phenomenon that led Hempel to this view: confounding factors. The second stage, the next chapter, will aim to do two things. Firstly, it will bolster Hempel's discussion. Hempel relies on a handful of examples to drive his charge against his target. He will not be successful without covering some further ground. Secondly, the moral of Hempel's discussion will be applied to natural language more generally: natural language expressions do not have their own application criteria. This is for a reason which precludes their having their own intension or extension. In this way I hope to provide reason to deny the hypothesis. More on that later. 128 (Hempel 1988) 95 2 Hempel on the empiricist construal of theories and their application Hempel attacked a view of theories and their application that he called ―the empiricist construal.‖ According to it, theories determine how they apply to particular cases; that is, whether or not such and such counts as falling within the extension of an expression within the theory.129 Hempel means by a theory, T, the following: <C, I>.130 The first component, C, consists of expressions and ―basic laws.‖ The expressions can be used to speak of certain entities and processes which conform to the basic laws. The terms and principles of C allow the formulation of arguments that allow one to derive conclusions from premises. The second component, I, will ―link‖ the terms and principles of C to ―the empirical phenomena to which‖ C is to be applied. The I 129 Cartwright (1999, p.184) attacks the same view of theories. She calls it ―the vending machine view.‖ Just as a vending machine is already assembled to provide a determinate output of beverage for a determinate input of currency, so too, a theory is already assembled for generating determinate predictions given determinate observations. Cartwright denies that scientific theories do any such thing. She (1999, chapter 2) explains her alternative view of what scientific theories do by appeal to G. E. Lessing's discussion of fables and morals. Just as morals are ―filled out‖ by the particularities of fables so too theories are ―filled out‖ by appropriately constructed descriptions of a particular situation, a model of that situation. Without such a thing, a theory provides no predictions whatsoever. For instance, imagine a $1,000 note falling in Saint Stephen's Square in Vienna. Suppose we ask an expert in fluid mechanics to predict where it will land. The problem with attempting to employ such theories here is that, as described, such theories are inapplicable to the situation. The expert ―should immediately complain that the problem is ill defined. What exactly is the bill like: is it folded or flat? Straight down the middle? Or ...? is it crisp or crumpled? How long versus how wide? And so forth and so forth and so forth.‖ (Cartwright 1999, p.27) The Newtonian example below will illustrate this same point. Furthermore, analogous to Hempel's proviso condition (to be introduced below) we find Cartwright's requirement that when a theory is applied one has to find or construct a ―nomological machine‖: ―a fixed (enough) arrangement of components, or factors, with stable (enough) capacities that in the right sort of stable (enough) environment will, with repeated operation, give rise to the kind of regular behaviour that we represent in our scientific laws.‖ (Cartwright 1999, p.50) If there is a reason I have focused on Hempel over Cartwright it is that there are elements of Cartwright's exposition for which I have misgivings. For example, she talks of elements of theories corresponding to ―capacities‖ and she attempts to describe these. This is an unhelpful venture into analytic metaphysics. Cartwright appears to think this will help with the kinds of trouble Hempel introduces for the empiricist construal/vending machine view. See for example (Cartwright and Efstathiou forthcoming). Hempel's discussion is more frugal than this and so preferable. But I cannot deny that Cartwright (1999) has been a strong influence on the ideas of this chapter and the next. It is the similarity between a Cartwrightian nomological machine and a Wittgensteinian language game which I found particularly striking. Any need for the former is, I think, justification for expecting the latter to be the proper unit of analysis of substantial truth-conditions. This should become more fully apparent in the next chapter (albeit in terms of the jargon introduced in the present chapter). 130 (Hempel 1988, pp.147-148) 96 component provides application criteria for the expressions from the C component.131 Hempel argues that theories include no I component that successfully determines how the C expressions are to be applied: The foregoing considerations show in particular that when a theory contains interpretative sentences...they cannot be regarded as unequivocal complete or partial criteria of applicability for theoretical expressions. (Hempel 1988, p.151)132 He thinks this because scientific theories are always subject to the threat that (confounding) factors to which the theory is insensitive undermine the validity of inferences the theory licences. Hempel claims, in effect, that once law-statements in theories have been interpreted so that predictions can be made with them, they become non-monotonic. They are no different (in this respect) from conditionals like, ―if there are very dark clouds, then it will rain.‖ If you add ―and there is a lot of pollution causing there to be grey clouds,‖ then one might reject the conditional as inapplicable in this case: you risk making an inference to a falsehood. According to Hempel, the I component is something that is incorporated into T upon a particular application of C.133 Hempel's ―foregoing considerations‖ consist of (brief) examinations of exemplary scientific theories upon application. We will look at some examples of theories which when applied in certain ways in certain circumstances give bad predictions. The first example will be Hempel's own: a theory of magnetism. The second will be a variant on another of Hempel's own: Newtonian mechanics. The third will be drawn from the ethnographic work of Michael Lynch on the classification of brain cells. All I aim to do in this chapter is describe these examples so that we have 131 (Hempel 1988, p.149). Although the terms of C are interpreted with a second vocabulary, that of I, the relation that the interpretative part of T is supposed to identify is that between the symbols of C and extra-symbolic things, viz. that for which the theory is to account; that which is described by means of the vocabulary C via I. 132 I have omitted (the  ...') reference here to Carnapian reduction sentences. But since Hempel's target is more general than this, the omission is not important. See (Hempel 1988, p.148). I have also omitted the hedge, ―usually.‖ It implies Hempel was willing to allow that there are application criteria which can be unequivocal and non-partial etc. What these are supposed to be is entirely unclear from his paper because he considers no exceptions. What is clear is that the phenomenon he describes must be pervasive enough to make us question the truth of the empiricist construal. 133 See the discussion of provisoes below and (Hempel 1988, p.154). 97 firmly in mind the phenomenon of confounding factors that can afflict reasoning about empirical states of affairs. 2.1 Example (1): a simple theory of magnetism In this first example, C includes terms and principles of an elementary theory of magnetism. C contains expressions ―magnet‖ ―north pole‖ and ―south pole‖ and the following principles: P1) The parts of a magnet are magnets. P2) If a is a magnet and b is a magnet then the opposite poles of a and b will attract one another and the like poles will repel one another. I consists of ―some operational criteria‖ for the terms of C.134 In particular, suppose: P3) Something's being a metal bar to which iron filings are clinging is our criterion for falling within the extension of ―magnet.‖ P4) Two items' being two magnets hung by threads the same distance from the ground but close to one another and which form a line is our criterion for being two magnets that attract their opposite poles and repel their like poles. This C and I constitute our T. We can use this T as follows. We can take a metal bar to which iron filings cling and classify that as within the extension of ―magnet‖ by P3. We can then use P1 to infer that if we break these metal bars in two we will get two further magnets. This then allows us to employ P2. But what should we expect of magnets whose like poles repel and whose opposite poles attract? For that we turn to P4. Thus from T we can predict that if we thread up these metal bars so that they are the same distance from the ground but close to one another, then they will form a line. Hempel raises the following (rather obvious) problem for the view that an inference made using C thus applied is valid: any link between these sentences can be undermined by the presence of further factors. A confounding factor, if present, is such that that which one is attempting to predict depends upon it yet whether it is 134 (Hempel 1988, p.148) 98 so is not something that forms part of the premises of the argument. Confounding factors cut loose a conclusion from its premises. Should one infer that the metal bars will form a line given P1, P2, and P3? In some circumstances it would be unwise: The theory [of magnetism] clearly allows for the possibility that two bar magnets, suspended by fine threads close to each other at the same level, will not arrange themselves in a straight line; for example, if a strong magnetic field of suitable direction should be present in addition, then the bars would orient themselves so as to be parallel to each other; similarly, a strong air current would foil the prediction, and so forth...The theory of magnetism does not guarantee the absence of such disturbing factors. (Hempel 1988, p.150) Similarly, suppose one observes iron filings stick to the metal bar and so one is licensed by P3 to call it a ―magnet.‖ But suppose there is an adhesive on the bar, or the filings themselves are magnetised, or etc. In such cases, one's prediction may not obtain. Similarly again, even if there is a bona fide magnet, if you break it in two you will not necessarily witness the metal bars forming a line when suspended above the ground. For instance, ―if the breaking of the magnet takes place at a high temperature, the pieces may become demagnetized.‖135 Though for all this, in some other circumstances one can make accurate predictions with this T. 2.2 Example (2): Newtonian mechanics A second example to which Hempel appeals is the use of Newton's mechanics to predict the motions of the planets.136 To describe this in any detail would be complex (for a non-physicist or non-mathematician) and Hempel does not even do so himself. So I am going to consider another situation in which the same point can be made in a little more detail without too great complexity. Do not worry if you are not familiar with the mechanics. The point being made will become clear enough. 135 (Hempel 1988, p.151) 136 (Hempel 1988, p.151) 99 Consider the following type of scenario. A man throws a ball in the direction of a window. We want to know whether the ball will hit the window. Suppose that we take some measurements and produce the following description of the situation: The man throws the ball from a height of 0.8m in the direction of the window at an angle of 45° to the horizontal at an initial speed of 10m/s. The window is 0.9m off the ground and 0.6m in height itself. We need to overlay a coordinate system onto the situation so that we can produce an equation which describes certain properties of the ball relative to some point of origin. The point of origin will be the floor below the location from which the man throws the ball. That will be point 0 for both horizontal and vertical dimensions, where the latter extends out to the right. So the starting position of the ball is 0.8m along the vertical axis and 0m along the horizontal axis. Let us express all this in terms of Hempel's empiricist construal, a theory T=<C, I>. We need some C and some I. The C will include Newton's second law: the force applied to an object is equivalent to the mass, m, of the object multiplied by the acceleration, a, of the object. Suppose that the only force acting on the ball as it travels toward the window is gravity pulling it downward. Suppose further that the ball's size will not significantly affect its trajectory. C will also include an equation which allows us to derive the height of the ball when it has travelled 7 metres along the horizontal axis. This equation is: r = ut + 1⁄2at2 where r is the distance travelled, t is the time taken, u is the initial velocity, and a is the acceleration. So we have some expressions (r, t, u, a, and m) and two principles (r = ut + 1⁄2at2 and F=ma) as elements of C. The I will include the following. Given Newton's second law, and our two suppositions, the acceleration of the ball will be: F = 1 * -9.8 = -9.8 along the vertical axis. This value for the force applied to the ball as it is in motion is based 7 metres 0.9 metres 0.6 metres 0.8 metres 45° 10m/s 100 upon observations made by others of the force that a particular object exerts on objects near to it; namely, the Earth. From these observations, and given our two suppositions, we arrive at the number -9.8. Had the gravitational pull of the Earth been different, and recorded, then this number would have been different. The number can be found in a number of ways. One way to find it is to measure the acceleration of a ball rolling down a plane inclined to the horizontal and to employ some trigonometry. The acceleration can be measured by calculating the speed the ball reaches at varying distances from the base of the plane. The speed will be different depending upon the distance. But the rate at which the speed increases as the ball roles down the plane will be invariant across the different distances covered. This rate will be the gravitational pull the Earth exerts on objects close to its surface. If this is where we get our number from, then we can say that the criterion for applying a in this case will be a number generated in this way for the planet one is on. Suppose the distances were measured by means of a tape measure, hand, eye, and pencil. The speed was calculated, we may suppose, by training the man to throw balls at particular speeds. Suppose he was trained by telling him, by means of a speedometer, how fast his throws were. He kept adjusting his throws until he could throw a ball at a speed dictated in advance of the throw. That is how the figure 10m/s was obtained for this throw: the man had learnt to throw a ball at that speed. We can suppose something similar for the angle at which the man throws the ball. However, we need to calculate the velocity of the ball for both the horizontal and vertical axes so that we can get a value for u to feed into our equation. We can calculate this from the numbers we already have by means of trigonometry. Consider the following: 45° 10m/s Opposite Adjacent 101 In a right angled triangle: sin θ = opposite/hypotenuse and cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse. So in the current case: opposite = 10sin45 and adjacent = 10cos45. That gives us the starting velocity, u, of the ball in component vector form. We can write it, treating i as a marker of the x-axis and j as a marker of the y-axis: u = 10sin45i + 10cos45j. Filling in the values of our equation (r = ut + 1⁄2at2) that we have for u and a, we get: r=(10sin45i + 10cos45j)t + 1⁄2(-9.8j)t2 r=10sin45it + 10cos45jt + 1⁄2(-9.8j)t2 If we ignore the vertical axis component (the j vector) in the equation, we can see that for every metre travelled along the horizontal axis, the time taken is 10sin45 seconds. So if r = 7 metres, we get: 7=10sin45t t=0.9899seconds This is how long it takes for the ball to travel 7 metres along the horizontal axis. We can now use the same equation to calculate how high up the y-axis the ball will be when 7 metres along the horizontal axis from where it started. We do this by, this time, ignoring the horizontal axis component (the i vector) and feeding in our value for t: r=10cos45(0.9899) + 1⁄2(-9.8)(0.9899)2 r= 2.198metres 2.198 metres is the height we predict the ball will reach when it has travelled 7 metres along the horizontal axis, i.e. to the right of the man. The highest point of the window (1.5metres) is far less than the height the ball is predicted reach. So we can predict that the ball will not hit the window. We can now ask whether our prediction will be correct. The answer is ―it depends.‖ If there was a strong wind between the man and the window, then our calculation of the force applied to the ball would lead to an inaccurate prediction. We would have to add the force supplied by the wind to get a value for a that would enable us 102 to get an accurate prediction, where the wind force was calculated in an acceptable manner. Similarly, if the ball had within it magnetic elements and there were a powerful electromagnet nearby, we would have to factor in that force. Other more complex additional factors are also possible. Suppose for instance that there were helium in the ball, or the ball underwent particularly high air resistance or that a nearby dog was on the lookout and ready to catch the ball. In each case we would have to modify how we make our prediction and sometimes this will include changing how we obtain values for the variables in our equation. Similar issues arise for the ways in which the other numbers were obtained. For instance, if the length of the tape measure that came to be 7 metres when measuring the length between the window and the man was not perpendicular to the 0.8 metres measured between the ground and the starting point of the ball, then we will get a distorted prediction because our prediction is based on the assumption that those two measurements fall along the perpendicular axes of a coordinate system that we have, as it were, overlaid onto the scene before us. We would either have to correct for the absence of the right angle or else place constraints on how the tape measure is to be employed to get the measurement (e.g. with aid of a set square). Either way we would modify how we were obtaining the value for r that we use in a step in our calculations. So as in the magnetism example we have a particular T=<C, I>. But although this T will allow us to make good predictions in some circumstances, in others it will not. In other circumstances we would have to modify the application criteria of the expressions in C (of the variables in our equations) if we wanted to use those equations to make an accurate prediction. The reason why we would have to modify the application criteria is that confounding factors would be present that would undermine the prediction. 2.3 Example (3): Lynch on intact and degenerate axons I do not know of detailed work on the usage of terms to categorise items in physics. So we will not examine such a thing for terms like ―force‖ or ―magnet.‖ But I do know of detailed work on the usage of terms in biology. I want to present a third illustration of the phenomenon to which Hempel draws our attention. This is a more extended example being as it is a real example of the application of terms to particular items. The example is drawn from Michael Lynch's ethnography of 103 scientists working in a biological laboratory in the 1970s.137 The discussion falls into four sections. The first describes the work done by the scientists in question. The second describes the expression we will focus on and introduces a principle within which the expression figures. This principle can be used to make predictions. The third describes various confounding factors with which scientists had to deal in employing the expression and the principle. The fourth is a summary. 2.3.1 Looking for cell regeneration The scientists were studying brain plasticity: the capacity of the brain to recover a function lost as a result of lesion. The research question of the investigators was: how does this happen? They pursued this question by examining micrographs of brains taken at different intervals since being lesioned so they could watch for cell regeneration. The investigators chose the hippocampus as the part of the brain to lesion and of which to take pictures. They did so because they knew that the organisation of cells in the hippocampus ―facilitated comparative studies which were not possible in other brain areas.‖138 We can see why this is by examining a diagram of the cell layout in the hippocampus: 137 (Lynch 1985) 138 (Lynch 1985, pp.28-29) 104 A neuron has a cell body.139 There are tentacles extending out from the cell on one side and a single tentacle extending out from the other side. The former are called dendrites. These allow electrical signals into the cell. The latter is called an axon which allows electrical signals out from the cell. In the diagram you can see one large cell: a granule cell. Out below the granule cell there is an axon. Out above it there is a tree of dendrites. The lines running horizontally across the page represent axons from other neurons whose cell bodies are in other parts of the brain. The top bundle comes from the entorhinal cortex. The middle bundle comes from other parts of the hippocampus. This structure is amenable to comparative study of lesion and re-growth because it is possible to damage cells in the entorhinal cortex, and thus the axons stemming from those cells into the hippocampus, without damaging those axons from the other parts of the hippocampus; and this despite their very close proximity to one another in the section of the hippocampus represented in the diagram. Thus cell regeneration can be observable through visual examination. Micrographs of this section of the hippocampus were produced in the following way. Because one cannot take micrographs of cells as they grow – any one micrograph required killing the animal to take it – the micrographs taken were actually taken of the hippocampi of multiple rats. A cohort of rats140 was subjected to lesion of the entorhinal cortex and killed at different time intervals from the day of the lesion. Upon being killed, the brains of the animals were removed and placed in a ―formaldehyde-like solution‖ which slowed decay.141 The hippocampus was then removed and small pieces were cut ―in cross section.‖142 These pieces were then placed in shallow dishes of liquid plastic and hardened. The resultant plastic discs were then cut ―with a fine-toothed saw‖ to get access to the hippocampus therein. The exposed surface of the hippocampus was then sliced off using a microtome. The sliced-off surface was immersed in a series of liquids. These were for staining the material so that the cells within it could be distinguished visually, for rinsing the stain, for ―counter-staining,‖ and for further rinsing.143 These hippocampus sections were then ready to be micrographed. The microscopist would 139 The diagram is taken from (Lynch 1985, p.36). 140 These were ―Sprague-Dawley rats – a standard breed of white rat of relatively uniform brain weight and dimension.‖ (Lynch 1985, p.37). 141 (Lynch 1985, p.37) 142 (Lynch 1985, p.37) 143 (Lynch 1985, p.37) 105 take a series of micrographs in vertical alignment extending out from the layer of a granule cell body, following the line of a dendrite into the horizontal lines of the axons from elsewhere.144 The micrographs were then analysed in the following way. A clear plastic sheet was laid over a montage of micrographs from successive days. A linear scale was drawn onto the plastic sheet running up from the granule cell body. The micrographs were divided into 5 micron segments ranging from 60 to 130 microns from the granule cell base. This scale would have to be computed with the degree of magnification of the microscope in mind. The cells in the micrograph were then marked according to cell type with different coloured markers for different types on the plastic overlay. The main distinction for our purposes was that between intact and degenerating axons.145 The markings were then tallied. The relative density of intact and degenerate axons was calculated for each segment. Each count was indexed to a sector on the scale along which the segments were registered.146 From this one could compare the densities at different distances from the granule cell body of intact and degenerate axons. One could then compare these densities from rats that had been killed at different intervals since being lesioned. 2.3.2 Some expressions and their application The scientists involved were making two predictions. The first was that the frequency of intact axons on the site of the lesion will be greater at a later time than at an earlier time. The second is that the difference between an earlier and later day in area covered by intact axons is larger than the difference in area of the entorhinal cortex axons. The second was important because an alternative hypothesis to the hypothesis that there was cell growth was that the entorhinal region shrank and pulled in cells from the hippocampal region without there being any growth at all. To show this alternative hypothesis was false the investigators sought to show that the extent of increased area of intact axons could not be accounted for by the amount by which the entorhinal region shrank. If these conditions were observed to obtain then the investigators would infer that cell regeneration was taking place. We can express this, once again, in terms of 144 (Lynch 1985, p.38) 145 Or more specifically the end of an axon, an axon bouton. 146 (Lynch 1985, p.39, p.50) 106 Hempel's empiricist construal. So we have a theory, T=<C, I>. In the present case the main principle which allows a subsequent prediction to be made is this: L: If the frequency of intact axons in a given location is greater at a later time than at an earlier time, and if the difference between an earlier and later day in area covered by intact axons is larger than the difference in area of the entorhinal cortex axons, then there is growth of axons into the damaged region. In this example unlike in the other two, at the time at which this experiment was carried out there was no straightforward criterion for ―growth of axons into the damaged region.‖ If there were, then to show that that was going on, one could employ that method. However, it is now possible to observe whether axons grow or not more directly.147 That could provide a separate application criterion for ―growth of axons into the damaged region.‖ We are going to focus on how the investigators employed the expression ―intact axon.‖ To apply it (as part of L) one needs to know what to count as an intact axon and what not. So how did the investigators count items as ―intact axons‖ or not? The frequency of intact axons was ascertained by collecting tallies of the number of intact and degenerate cells from different days since lesion. Scientists looked over micrographs and literally counted the cells they could see, categorising them as (images of) intact axons or not. If the frequency of intact axons thus counted increased as the time since lesion increased then that was treated as an increase in the number of intact axons.148 So in this procedure, the interpretation given to ―intact axon‖ or ―image of intact axon‖ was the marks on the micrographs studied by scientists at this part of the study. That is how the numbers for these frequencies were generated for the investigator's paper(s). It was found that initially after the lesion there were no intact axons (as counted in the way just described) after the 75 micron mark.149 But after several days, there came to be an increasing number.150 It was shown that the shift in distribution of 147 The technique involved replacing a skull segment with a window to observe cell growth. See: http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0030301. 148 (Lynch 1985, p.50) 149 Or more precisely, no intact axons were observed after a few days during which the axons had time to degenerate after the lesion. 150 (Lynch 1985, p.50) 107 intact axons could not be accounted for by the alternative hypothesis.151 So the investigators made the inference licensed by L. 2.3.3 Confounding factors L's application is just as subject to confounding factors as the principles of the earlier Hempelian examples. Intact axons in a given brain slice were counted by the appearance of marks on the material on which the relevant micrograph is printed. Any factor whose variation leads to variation in the numbers generated in the tallying process without variation in the actual structure of the hippocampi investigated will void the predictive principle thus applied.152 Investigators exhibited a sensitivity to such interference in how they classified marks on micrographs: as images of various sorts of cell (for our purposes: as intact axons or as degenerate axons) or instead as marks with no relation to the cells of the pertinent hippocampus. We will now run through a catalogue of fifteen examples of confounding factors to which investigators showed sensitivity. In each example there is something which can erroneously affect the tallying process described above either by leading to a failure to count intact axons or a failure to count only intact axons. Why provide so many examples? Because one objection to the claim that there is no I immune to confounding factors is that there are such I in the sciences when we consider sophisticated enough examples. That this is not so should become apparent if we take a step away from the dust of the textbook and, by way of the examples, toward the difficulties of application. Example 1: An excessive level of staining solution on a part of the sliced hippocampus would mean an excessive level of heavy metal ion. Placed under an electron microscope, the micrograph taken would include an opaque dark patch corresponding to the excess stain.153 The excess could accrue from so seemingly insignificant an act as ―a researcher having exhaled his breath in close proximity to the stain.‖ More generally, when staining, the time for which a brain part is left in a given liquid is something that will bear upon the tallying process. Too little and 151 (Lynch 1985, pp. 32-34, pp.104-107, pp.284-287) 152 Textbooks list problems that arise in laboratory procedures. Lynch (1985, p. 65, p.90) reports on this separately. We are interested in issues that arise which can only be discovered by examining the setting in which one carries out the project described and which may well be peculiar to it, but which need to be overcome for L to let one make a good prediction. 153 (Lynch 1985, p.92) 108 things are not visibly discriminable; too much and you damage the material. There was inevitably variation in this across occasions of its performance.154 Too much variation of this sort would void the use of the principle for prediction.155 Example 2: The microtome when it cut a thin layer of hippocampus could leave a mark which appeared as a clear area in the texture of membranes and granules.156 Example 3: There were formations of crystals during the embedding procedure (i.e. in which the tissue was immersed in a molten plastic and then allowed to harden). The crystals would appear as hole-like structures on the micrographs.157 Example 4: When the (very) thin portion of the hippocampus was taken from the microtome after cutting, the material might fold. This would leave ―visibly linear arrangements similar to knife marks in appearance.‖158 Example 5: Other marks which could distort how things appeared in the photographs included: ―grains,‖ attributed to the effects of the embedding procedure; burn marks, from ―the electron beam's intensive passage through a thin sheet of tissue‖; and dust particles and foreign matter.159 Example 6: The microtome could stretch the material it cut, distorting the shapes and dimensions of items.160 As a consequence one could confuse one item with another. The distortion might also affect the distribution of items across the grid used to divide the micrograph into five micron segments. If a given micrograph were stretched but treated as though it were not stretched, then when one counted the items in a given segment, one would count fewer than one would have, had one not stretched the material. Example 7: When the brain tissue is placed in a ―formaldehyde-like‖ substance, the substance might fail to properly perfuse the tissue. The result would be that that part of the tissue that was not properly preserved would decay. This would show 154 (Lynch 1985, p.62) 155 (Lynch 1985, p.100) 156 (Lynch 1985, p.92). A microtome is a device for cutting very thin slices of material for use in microscopy. 157 (Lynch 1985, p.93) 158 (Lynch 1985, p.93) 159 (Lynch 1985, p.93) 160 (Lynch 1985, p.99) 109 itself in the micrographs as a ―fused membrane.‖161 It was taken as reason enough not to use the micrograph thus obtained to produce numbers. I presume this was because of concern about the accuracy of producing ―raw‖ tallies from such materials. Example 8: There could be a loss of the discreteness of cell membranes produced by the chemicals involved in staining and fixing.162 Example 9: The chemical processes involved in preserving the brain tissue could break and displace membranes 163 Example 10: The dislodging of cells can have obvious consequences for tallying up the number of cells in each 5 micron segment. The scientists whom Lynch studied believed a certain kind of cell does not occur naturally in the blood stream. However, something that looked like that kind of cell was found in a capillary. It was counted as having got there from being displaced at some point in the production process.164 Thus the scientists' understanding of what could happen within a mammalian body impinged upon how they categorised items in the micrographs they examined. Example 11: Recall the alternative hypothesis which the investigators sought to show irrelevant: the region of the hippocampus in which there was the degenerate axons shrinks but the intact axons do not grow. If this was not taken into account, one would, on the basis of the counting of observed intact axons, overestimate the extent of the expansion. Example 12: A case is reported in which rats died prematurely from infection.165 Their exposure to radiation had weakened their immune systems. This was corrected next time around by giving the rats doses of penicillin. The question to ask is: why did the scientists involved not go through the motions with these dead rats? Aside from the decay and concomitant distortion of results, the rats had to be alive for the axons to grow and they had to be alive for a measured period of time. 161 (Lynch 1985, pp.99-100) 162 (Lynch 1985, p.100) 163 (Lynch 1985, p.100) 164 (Lynch 1985, pp.101-104) 165 (Lynch 1985, p.117) 110 Example 13: On one occasion an analyst of a montage took the micrographs to have a spatial arrangement on the table before him which they did not have. The micrographs were arranged in two columns. One ran on from the other. So there was a beginning on the base of one column. The series went up that column and then continued from the bottom of the other column. However, one of the analysts thought that the left hand column was where the sequence began when really it was the right hand column. This led to difficulties in the conversation between the scientists examining the micrographs. Their divergent understanding of the spatial arrangement of the micrographs influenced how each categorised items. Failures to do this right would undermine inferences drawn from tallies made.166 Example 14: Materials were stored for periods of time. During this time they needed protecting from other occurrences. They were stored in such a way as to ensure this.167 Example 15: The handling of the rats can introduce various invalidating factors. For instance, the injection of preservative into the brain had to be done before the rat's heart had ceased beating because the beating heart was used to get the substance into the rat's brain. Failure to get this right would affect the tallying process because of the importance of the preservative on the quality of the micrographs that are eventually taken. Lynch reports that various problems are faced when injecting preservatives into a rat's brain. 168 For instance, the rat may bleed in ways that threaten the injected chemical's arrival in the brain, which is consequential for how well preserved the hippocampus will be. 2.3.4 Summary This is not intended as a finite list. Scientists doing the tallying had to be sensitive to what would undermine the employment of their predictive principle as applied and to change their tallying practices accordingly when required: ...the concrete visibility and indefinite possibility of artifact haunts the work in an ongoing fashion, and, in so haunting the work, is essentially part of 166 (Lynch 1985, pp.239-247, but esp. p.243) 167 (Lynch 1985, p.61) 168 (Lynch 1985, pp.69-80) 111 the finding, testing, announcing, and arguing over results. (Lynch 1985, p.291, note 5)169 Scientists deploying L do so not by implementing a general criterion of how an axon looks when a micrograph is taken of it but rather they examine the micrographs while exercising a constant sensitivity to how, in the circumstances, the images witnessed under the microscope should be interpreted in light of what confounding factors the local environment has induced. The result is that they adjust what they will count as an image of an intact axon depending upon whether confounding factors lead to erroneous deployments of L. So as with the previous examples, what on one occasion might be an adequate criterion for counting something as an intact axon will not on another.170 3 Can we generalise? In each example we have some T conforming to the empiricist construal which fails to provide accurate predictions in certain circumstances. The failures arise because there are factors present in those circumstances which influence whether or not that which is being predicted obtains but to which the basis upon which one makes the prediction is insensitive. In the face of this Hempel proposes not that the candidates for I that he considers are not the real I for the relevant C.171 What he proposes instead is that whatever I is employed for a given C it must meet a proviso condition: 169 For more recent empirical work on how scientists are ―haunted‖ by confounding factors see papers by Kevin Dunbar, e.g. (Dunbar 2001). 170 In their textbook on experimentation, Cook and Campbell (1979, p.7) describe three notions of control sought in carrying experiments. As they say, ―The three senses of control all involve ruling out threats to valid inference.‖ For a more general discussion of threats to valid inference when carrying out an experiment see (Cook and Campbell 1979, chapter 2). 171 My reading of Hempel diverges from, for example, (Fodor 1991, p.21). Fodor invokes a distinction between strict and non-strict laws. The difference is between laws which have exceptions and laws which do not. Fodor claims that Hempel is claiming that there are no strict laws. For a discussion of the kind of distinction Fodor invokes here see (Woodward 2002). Fodor is only speaking accurately of Hempel in a sense. If in addition to having no exceptions, a strict law is one that has built into it its own application conditions, then yes, Hempel is claiming that there are no strict laws. But this is incidental to his main point. For it is also open, given the view I am attributing to Hempel, for what are traditionally classified as non-strict laws to be classified as strict on some applications. This way with Hempel would mean it is not accurate to say that he is denying that there are any strict laws. It is rather that he is dismissing the distinction between strict and non-strict laws that Fodor invokes so that he (Hempel) can take account of the application-sensitivity of what a law (as it were) says will happen given what else is so. 112 Provisoes might rather be viewed as assumptions of completeness. The proviso required for a theoretical inference from one sentence, S1, to another, S2, asserts, broadly speaking, that in a given case...no factors other than those specified in S1 are present which could affect the event described by S2. (Hempel 1988, p.157) Hempel claims that when applying,172 with some given I, a C in which there are two sentences S1 and S2 and a principle that allows one to infer one from the other, one must ensure that nothing other than S1 (so interpreted) affects whether or not S2 (so interpreted) obtains. If one can do that, then one can make a valid inference; an accurate prediction. Hempel's proviso requirement does need to be met. However, suppose there were some I such that no matter the circumstances in which a T were applied there are never any confounding factors which undermine the validity of inferences licensed by the theory. Then the empiricist construal of theories and their application could still be correct. For this reason, although the examples Hempel provides (and our own) are suggestive, they are not by themselves sufficient to establish Hempel's conclusion. Why would Hempel think his examples, combined with his proviso condition, imply that the empiricist construal is incorrect? He must be supposing that there are no I for a given C such that the C thus applied is immune to interference from further factors not registered by S1.173 If this were so, then, given the proviso condition, no theory which was worth its salt would include its own application criteria. For if it did it would recommend that a user make predictions without proper warrant: it would be like drawing a conclusion about a claim from data collected in a badly conducted experiment. If the data were collected in an environment that is not properly controlled for what can influence the numbers (or whatever) generated, then the data will not be a basis upon which to draw valid inferences. If there are no I that are immune to interference from confounding factors, then using a theory that included its own application criteria would be on 172 (Hempel 1988, p.154) 173 I should remind the reader that Hempel explicitly commits himself to the claim only that usually application criteria are subject to a proviso. However, a response open to Hempel's opponent is that Hempel was unable to find the correct application criteria for the theories he discusses but that that does not mean they are not there to be found. Because the examples Hempel provides are evidence against the empiricist construal only if this is not so, to have a case against the empiricist construal Hempel needs to suppose that there are no such criteria. 113 an equal footing with drawing inferences from such data.174 In the next chapter we will see what can be done to support the Hempelian supposition. 174 Indeed, Lynch's investigators do not use fixed criteria for applying ―intact axon‖ but are instead constantly modifying what they will count as such with a sensitivity to the actual confounding factors of the circumstances. 114 C H A P T E R I V Formal semantics, balance, and calibration 1 Introduction We have a lead. We will now follow it. I will first describe how we can represent the C element of Hempel's empiricist construal within a formal semantics. Second, I will describe, in more detail than we did in the last chapter, the supposition Hempel needs to make if we are to show the empiricist construal is incorrect. Third, I will present some reasons in favour of accepting this supposition. Fourth, I will present an argument against the empiricist construal. In a sense that will be explained below, I will conclude that speakers need to ―calibrate‖ expressions when reasoning with them. They cannot rely on a pre-fabricated convenience. They have to do it themselves. This will then be illustrated with the sentence ―The leaves are green.‖ I close the chapter by explaining why the calibration of expressions for the purposes of valid reasoning would manifest itself in changes in the extension of linguistic expressions just as is witnessed in Travis cases. Given the need for calibration (as argued earlier in the chapter), there is then reason to expect Travis cases to arise as a natural part of language use. Furthermore, they arise in a way not amenable to a further factor analysis that includes commitment to the hypothesis. We will have in hand a reason to accept OS. 2 Reasoning and formal semantics The element of the empiricist construal which includes the linguistic expressions with which reasoning is done is C. It will be useful in what follows if these 115 linguistic expressions conformed to a formal semantics for which we have a definition of entailment. Let us say that a language which operates in accordance with a formal semantics is a semantic calculus. A semantic calculus can be used to calculate the truth-value of a sentence given the truth-values of some others. Recall our definition of entailment from our toy semantics in Chapter I: Entailment: A sentence S relative to an LF α entails a sentence S′ relative to an LF β for every model M = <D, W, I, C, F>, if S is true in M relative to α, w, i, and c, then S′ is true in M relative to β, w, i, and c. For instance, consider the following three sentences: 1) Ralph sleeps. 2) If Ralph sleeps then Ralph sleeps. 3) Ralph sleeps. We can apply a formal semantics to them by first generating LFs for these sentences: 1') [S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]] 2') [S If [S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]] then [S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]]] 3') [S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]] Our question is then, do (1′) and (2′) entail (3′)? To answer this we need to consider: 1ʹʹ) I([S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g 2ʹʹ) I([S If [S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]] then [S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]]])M,w,i,c,g 3ʹʹ) I([S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g To show there is an entailment we need to show that if (1′′) = 1 and (2′′)=1 then (3′′)=1. Suppose that (1′′)=1 and (2′′)=1. Then, F(If...then...)(<I([S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g, I([S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g>) = 1, and, I([S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g = 1. Given this, and given the semantic rule for [S If S then S], F(If...then...)(<I([S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g, I([S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g>) = 1 only if I([S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g = 1. Hence, I([S [NP Ralph][Pred sleeps]])M,w,i,c,g = 1. So (1′′) and (2′′) entail (3′′). 116 Thus our definition of entailment for our toy semantics, when applied to (1), (2), and (3) allows us to infer (3) from the truth of (1) and (2). 3 The contingency thesis We closed the previous chapter with a description of a supposition Hempel needs to make if his proviso condition is to provide trouble for the empiricist construal. The supposition was that there are no I such that a C implemented with that I is immune to interference from confounding factors in all circumstances. I want now to state this supposition in a little more detail. This will require laying out some terms. There is an ambiguity in the word ―determine.‖ I can determine whether Alice will be on the Strand next Tuesday in the sense that I can discover whether this will be so or alternatively I can do so in the sense of making it is the case that Alice will or will not be on the Strand next Tuesday. I will use the word in the second sense. We will distinguish between two ways that a sentence can have its truth-value determined. The first is as follows. There are application criteria for the constituent expressions of the sentence. These determine the extensions of those expressions. There are then the composition rules for the sentence provided by the recursive semantic rules of the formal semantics. They make the truth-value of the sentence depend upon the relations between the extensions of the constituent expressions.175 That is one way the truth-value of a sentence can be determined. We will call this the vertical determination of its truth-value. The second way in which a sentence can have its truth-value determined is by being entailed by other sentences modelled in the same formal semantics. We saw an example of this above. This second determining of the truth-value of a sentence we will call horizontal. So we have vertical and horizontal truth-value determination. I want to introduce five requirements upon application criteria for expressions used in a stretch of reasoning. A stretch of reasoning is an argument with premises and a conclusion. We will focus on arguments in which the premises entail the conclusion. For simplicity let us suppose that there are no horizontal 175 The truth-value of a sentence could also have an application criterion to itself rather than (or as well as) it being a function of the application criteria of constituent expressions. As we will see soon, I will suppose this is so for conditionals. Such determinations of truthvalue are also classified as vertical. 117 determinations of the truth-value of the premises of the argument and that there are no horizontal determinations of the truth-value of the conclusion of the argument other than those mentioned in the requirements. The first requirement is that there must be vertical ways in which the truth-values of the premise-sentences are determined. For example, suppose I attempt to make a prediction about how many eggs there are in the basket given there are x boxes in the basket and y eggs in each box. I do this with an argument: there are x boxes; there are y eggs per box; if there are x boxes and y eggs per box then there are x*y eggs. I draw the obvious conclusion. But I cannot calculate how many eggs there are in the basket with this reasoning if the values I include for x and y are stipulated. The values for x and y have to be records of the number of boxes and the number of eggs per box. So the first requirement is this: 1) There must be application criteria for the premise sentences. The second requirement is: 2) The truth-value of the conclusion must be horizontally determined by the truth-values of the premise sentences. If not, then there is no way to use the argument to make predictions about the world via the premises of the argument. For example, if one attempted to derive the number of eggs in the basket without any premises from which to draw a conclusion about the total number of eggs in the basket then there would not be any argument by means of which you could learn of the total number of eggs in the basket. The first point applies equally to the conclusion. So the third requirement is: 3) There must be application criteria for the conclusion sentence. If there is no way in which the truth-value of the conclusion sentence depends upon how the world is, then any derivation of the sentence would not be a way to learn something about how the world is. It would be as though one derived the sentence, ―The youths are klem,‖ from the argument, ―If the youths are rioting then the youths are klem; the youths are rioting,‖ where there is nothing required of the world for the sentence ―The youths are klem‖ to be true independent of the 118 premises (given that they determine the truth-value of the conclusion sentence). So to gain knowledge of the world the expressions constituting the conclusion sentence must have application criteria. The fourth requirement is: 4) The application criteria of the premises and the conclusion cannot be numerically identical. If they were then one would not be learning something by means of the argument because one would have to know what one would derive in order to begin the derivation. You do not learn that the youths are rioting from the argument: the youths are rioting; if the youths are rioting then the youths are rioting. The fifth requirement is more easily stated if we introduce a new locution. Let us say that whether a given item falls within the extension of an expression is the verdict of an application criterion of that expression. The fifth requirement is then: 5) The application criteria of the premises and the conclusion must be such that their verdicts conform in their relation to the relation described by the relevant formal semantics. Consider a simple argument: ―If there are x boxes and y eggs per box, then there are x*y eggs; there are x boxes and y eggs per box; so, there are x*y eggs.‖ This is a valid argument. Provided the argument is interpreted as part of the same semantic calculus, the conclusion is entailed by the premises. Now consider the requirements (1)-(4). Requirement (2) is met because there is an argument here. Suppose that there are application criteria for the premises and the conclusion (so requirements (1) and (3) are met). Suppose finally that the application criteria of the premises and conclusion are distinct (so requirement (4) is met). Now it is possible for the premises to have the truth-value true and the conclusion to have the truth-value false. For it is possible that the application criteria that vertically determine the truth-values of the premises return verdicts of true, while the application criterion that vertically determines the truth-value of the conclusion returns a verdict of false. This can happen despite the fact that the rules of the semantic calculus within which the argument is written introduce a horizontal determination of the 119 truth-value of the conclusion by the truth-values of the premises. In that case requirement (5) is not met. For example, suppose that the application criterion for the number of eggs per box required one to effectively assume that each box was full. So the actual check carried out involved counting the number of eggs in one box that happened to be full and supposing that the place at which the boxes were filled did what was done to this box to all boxes. Then the number for y is determined by the verdict of an examination of just one box. So, suppose that there are 4 boxes. Then, that the sentence ―there are 6 eggs per box‖ has its truth-value determined in this way will, in the circumstances in which not all boxes are filled, lead to a conflict between what truth-value the sentence, ―there are 24 eggs,‖ will be assigned by means of the argument thus applied and what truth-value the sentence will be assigned by other application criteria.176 The possibility can arise because there are two ways that the truth-value of the conclusion is determined: horizontally by the premises of the argument (whose truth-values are in turn determined vertically) and vertically by the application criteria of the conclusion sentence. For ease of reference, we will say that when the application criteria of the premises and conclusion of an argument meet this fifth condition, they are balanced and the argument is balanced. Let us say that an array of application criteria for an argument is contingently balanced if there are possible circumstances in which those application criteria would be unbalanced. Our egg counting example illustrates this. In one circumstance having the truth-value of the sentence, ―there are 6 eggs per box,‖ (metaphysically) determined by verdict of a visual inspection of a single box where the application criteria for the other expressions are filled in in some more or less obvious way, will be part of a balanced argument. But in other circumstances (one in which there is variation across boxes as to the number of eggs in each) the same argument applied with the same application criteria will be unbalanced. So when it is balanced, it is contingently balanced. 176 Notice I am not denying that the reasoner fails to determine (in the epistemic sense) how many eggs there are. But nor am I supposing that the reasoner employs the sentence with more application criteria than have been mentioned. As we would use the English expressions, we can see that by the criteria we would most reasonably employ, the sentence ―there are 24 eggs‖ is false. Nonetheless, given how he employs the expressions, the determinations (in the metaphysical sense) of the truth-values of his conclusion exhibit the property described (as we may well do too, in a moment of confusion). 120 We can now state the supposition which would put us in a position to claim, with Hempel, that theories, or more generally, arguments, do not have fixed application criteria. It is this: There are no non-contingently balanced arrays of application criteria which meet the above five conditions. Let us call this the contingency thesis. 3.1 Imbalance and other malfunctions To get some perspective on what sort of thing balance is, consider two similar phenomena. One is set out by Diamond and the other is set out by Travis.177 Diamond proposes that there are some sentences which are nonsense (they fail to have sense) and their being nonsense arises because one cannot find a way that the referent of an NP could have or not have a property ascribed to it by a given predicate. For example, for the sentence ―Caesar is a prime number‖ ignoring certain easier readings, one can find it difficult to understand how ―is a prime number‖ could be a condition that Caesar is or is not in. We could describe this in our terms by saying that one cannot find an application criterion for ―is a prime number‖ such that one could reason with this sentence as part of an applied calculus. Travis proposes that circumstances can arise in which there are facts which point toward a sentence being true and facts that point toward the sentence being false where this is not a case of epistemic shortfall. The way the world is arranged may mean that when all the facts are in, it is just not determinate whether a sentence is true or false. The principle of bivalence is violated. I take an example of this from a discussion of Thomas Kuhn's later views on incommensurability as set out by an interpreter of that later work, Hoyningen-Huene.178 He describes how the Egyptians were led to describe the river Euphrates as ―that inverted water, which goes north in going south.‖ How did this claim come to be made? One can tell directions, north and south, by examining the stars. But also, as it happens, the Nile flows south to north in Egypt. From a distance one can tell one's directions by examining whether the sails are up on the ships traversing that river. So one has 177 (Diamond 1981) and (Travis 2009 [2008]) 178 (Hoyningen-Huene 1998, pp.13-14) 121 several criteria by means of which one might use the words ―north‖ and ―south.‖ These are criteria which in Egypt, coincide. However, at some point the Egyptians stumbled upon the Euphrates which flows north to south. The criteria that within Egypt coincided came apart. This led to the description of the Euphrates as that which goes north in going south. Given that something cannot both go north and south, to say ―I am going north‖ when walking along the Euphrates, operating the expression ―north‖ as the Egyptians did, would be to say something that is neither true nor false. Nothing more is to be discovered that will settle the matter given that the word ―north‖ is so used. Travis calls this natural isothenia. Being unbalanced, Diamond's nonsense, and Travis' natural isothenia are all species of a common genus. Each is a kind of malfunction of a calculus that arises because of what the application criteria are of the expressions used within the calculus. Unbalance arises when the vertical and horizontal determinations of the truth-value of a sentence do not coincide, allowing for a divergence between what we could call syntactic validity and validity in application. Diamond's nonsense arises when it is not clear with what application criteria one should use a predicate. Travis' natural isothenia arises when a single expression has multiple application criteria which do not return verdicts in unison. Each is a failure of a calculus upon application, one that goes unnoticed if one only ever considers stipulated models for a calculus which conform to the semantic rules of the calculus. 3.2 Why accept the contingency thesis? In this sub-section and the next we will find reason to maintain the contingency thesis. An immediate problem one will have in disputing the thesis is finding counterexamples and that is one thing that counts in its favour. It is difficult to find application criteria that meet the five conditions and which are noncontingently balanced. One way to see this is if I draw attention to a similarity between the contingency thesis and a widespread view about the usual bases of our inferences. It is a well known source of scepticism that the bases of our everyday inferences, that from which we infer other things, are such that, there are some circumstances under which that base occurs but that which we infer does not. It is possible for something that I count as pain in my tooth to obtain without there being any decay, even though I might draw the inference from the one to the other. 122 Similarly, with smoke and fire, hot water from steam vapour, rain from the damp pavement, and so on. The kinds of thing that meet our five conditions are the kinds of thing that tend to encourage a scepticism about our ordinary epistemic habits and the responses to that scepticism. That is because, despite the fact that we draw the inferences we do, that which we draw our inferences from does not necessarily support that which we draw them to. But that is the contingency thesis.179 A second reason to accept the thesis is that the best candidates there are for counterexamples to it are not counterexamples to it. The best candidates for counterexamples to this thesis are laws of science. These are general principles which both pertain to empirical states of affairs and can be (mistakenly) understood to licence inferences from certain kinds of states of affairs to certain others, without risk of being led to a falsehood. We have already seen that these principles need to be applied if predictions are to be made with them and it is in being applied that the sublime categories they employ have to be cashed out in terms of the hands-on apparatus of an experimental arrangement. At that point questions arise as to what counts as, for instance, an object's having 1 Newton of force, or an object's being a magnet, or an image being an image of an intact axon. There is not just one way to go about coming to a view on such matters. In some circumstances some of those ways of counting Newtons (etc.) will be such that one can reason well with them and in other circumstances those ways of counting Newtons (etc.) will not. One might object that the example we considered of the magnet was too toy. One might suppose that one does not check whether a metal bar is a magnet by seeing if iron filings stick to it.180 A more sophisticated technique will be available and that technique will not be susceptible to these concerns. In response to this objection I remind the reader of the intricacies involved in our third example. Presumably the kind of procedures the objector has in mind will include apparatus one would find in a laboratory and tests which are far more complex than throwing iron filings at metal bars. But I strongly suspect that if we were to examine such a procedure in all its particularity we would find another open ended list of 15 examples of 179 In saying this I am not endorsing scepticism: the thesis that we know nothing or can justify no claim. 180 Actually, most of us would in many circumstances use precisely this criterion. When someone says, ―Oh look, it's magnetic,‖ is it not commonly the case that the basis for the assertion was the pull the object exerted on other objects? 123 confounding factors for such a procedure, just as we did in the case of classifying cells as intact axons. One cannot escape the contingency thesis by making the scientific examples more complex. 3.3 Why reject the contingency thesis? There are various reasons for thinking that the contingency thesis is false. I want now to consider six. By examining these I hope to make the thesis more plausible by showing how such easy exits are no such thing. First of all, one might suspect that the thesis presupposes an erroneous view of what is available to us other than by inference; for example, that we are not capable of recognising force per se but only of making observations of a ball rolling down an inclined plane. If we did not accept such reductionism then we could allow that the terms of C do not need application criteria beyond something like: ―F‖ is satisfied by things that are F. Rather, when we apply a theory we recognise forces, intact axons, and so on without inferring that something is thus from something else. We have that capacity.181 This kind of objection mistakes the current proposal for something it is not. Firstly, the current proposal concerns situations in which one is using principles by which to reason. I am not claiming that we are always drawing inferences when we are not. Secondly, and more importantly, the role of interpretation in the current discussion is not motivated by an attempt at metaphysical reduction, e.g. an instrumentalist reduction of force to the movements of balls down an inclined plane. It is motivated by the fact that thinkers have to come to views about whether something falls within the extension of an expression somehow. Sometimes, it is true, this is done with the exercise of a perceptual capacity. It is not done by carrying out a procedure or by drawing an inference. However, firstly, we only sometimes exercise a perceptual capacity in this way. For many determinations of how to categorise an item some check or minor investigation must unfold.182 Secondly, just because one does on some occasions exercise a 181 For this kind of complaint see (McDowell 1982 [1998]) and (Sacks 1992, Part I, Lecture 11). 182 ―Let us consider the process of estimating a length by the eye: It is extremely important that you should realise that there are a great many different processes which we call ―estimating by the eye‖. Consider these cases:-- (1) Someone asks ―How did you estimate the height of this building?‖ I answer: ―It has four storeys; I suppose each storey is about 124 perceptual capacity to discern how to categorise an item, that does not mean there will not be occasions on which such ways of categorising items become unbalanced. Suppose one attempts to predict the total number of intact eggs by counting boxes and numbers of eggs per box. One does this by exercising a perceptual capacity to recognise boxes and intact eggs. But the way one might have been counting eggs in one circumstance, e.g. by things that look to you like eggs, need not be sufficient to accurately count eggs in another circumstance. Suppose that there are many doppelganger eggs in the boxes (an egg thief has tried to hide her crime). Then one could be fooled. That one is fooled does not mean one was only ever capable of recognising egg-like-things (as opposed to eggs). But it does mean in those circumstances, one's attempt to visually count the eggs renders application criteria in the argument unbalanced.183 This first objection is related to another.184 One might have a worry that hangs over from the previous chapter. One might not like this talk of application criteria at all. Is this not to accept a form of verificationism about meaning? One might think that the truth-conditions of a given sentence are its truth-conditions regardless of whether such and such persons count it as true under such and such conditions. But, one worries, that is not consistent with the invocation of application criteria made by us. For starters, nothing has been said about meaning. However, there is what is to be understood by a sentence. A reasoner would have to have this in hand when employing a sentence to reason. We have supposed that this will be what would make true the sentence. So let us work with that. fifteen feet high; so it must be about sixty feet.‖ (2) In another case: ―I roughly know what a yard at that distance looks like; so it must be about four yards long.‖ (3) Or again: ―I can imagine a tall man reaching to about this point; so it must be about six feet above the ground.‖ (4) Or: ―I don't know; it just looks like a yard.‖‖ (Wittgenstein 1958a, p.11) 183 Perceptual capacities vary not only with circumstance but with training. For example, Lynch (1985, p.2) describes how learning about electron microscopy ―gave me considerably more access to the talk and conduct which I witnessed in the lab than would have been possible had I relied solely on the analytic skills of a social scientist while observing members' activities.‖ Austin (1946) reports, what ought to be accepted anyway, that variation in the experience of a person changes what we count them as capable of knowing by sight. 184 A second spin-off of the first objection might be raised by appeal to Putnam's (1973) observations. But these do not pose problems for the invocation of application criteria. That part of a way in which one ought to use a word is decided by the characteristics of a sample and that there are deferential uses of expressions does not show it to be false that there are ways in which speakers can come to views about what the extension of an expression is. Sometimes this will involve samples and experts. That is all that needs adding. 125 The accusation of anti-realism goes as follows. According to semantic anti-realism the truth-conditions of sentences employed by speakers cannot extend beyond those which are recognisable by the speakers themselves. One might think that by supposing that there are ways in which truth-values of sentences are determined in the form of application criteria, and by supposing that the truth-conditions of sentences can be documented by observing the usage made of such sentences by speakers, we are committed to denying that what is to be understood by a sentence, by those speakers, is what would make it true. We must instead suppose that what is to be understood is an epistemic notion such as assertability conditions. Why think that? The argument runs as follows: 1) There is a claim S whose truth-conditions cannot be manifested in a speaker's behaviour. 2) If that which is to be understood by S cannot be manifested in a speaker's behaviour, then that which is to be understood cannot be understood. 3) We understand that which is to be understood by S. Hence, 4) That which is to be understood by S cannot be its truth-conditions.185 In speaking of application criteria have we committed ourselves to this conclusion? Firstly, the reason usually given in favour of accepting (1) is that we are aware of no methods (so no application criteria) for checking whether certain kinds of sentence are true or false (e.g. negative existential claims, universally quantified generalisations, and claims about the past). I do not accept that we do not have such capacities. One can discern whether or not it rained yesterday, for instance, or whether if you had turned left that evening, you would have avoided the accident. But unless a sceptical attitude is adopted toward such sentences we are not forced to accept the first premise.186 So we are not forced down a traditional route to antirealism. Secondly, perhaps we are committed to (1) simply because we are supposing that the truth-conditions of speaker's sentences are determined by the application 185 For the argument see (Dummett 1973 [1978], pp.224-225) quoted in (McDowell 1981 [1998], pp.316-317). 186 (McDowell 1978 [1998]) 126 criteria a speaker uses. Hence, truth-conditions cannot extend beyond the application criteria known by the speakers. But then, because speakers will not be able to employ application criteria in many cases, the truth-conditions of sentences must, on the current view, be severely limited to that which speaker's can check. I concede this but only in a sense. There is a difference between expressions being operated in accordance with certain application criteria, and actually employing those application criteria to come to a view about the expression's extension. Compare: knowing what one would count as a beetle being in the box while having no way to employ the criterion to come to a view about whether there is a beetle in the box. All we have committed ourselves to in using the notion of an application criterion is that there are methods by which the extensions of expressions employed by speakers are determined. We have not supposed that speakers actually are able to employ all such methods in all circumstances in which they may utter a sentence whose constituents have given extensions. Speakers could employ expressions, which have given application criteria, and so, extension, but that the speakers cannot deploy to ascertain the actual extension (thus determined) of the expressions. The extensions of expressions would be limited to that which the application criteria by which speakers employed expressions would determine (and indeed, consequences of those of which speakers may be ignorant). But this is not the same as being limited to application criteria which speakers are, there and then, in a position to use to determine in an epistemic sense, the extension of expressions employed. In this way, the extension of an expression can, on the current view, extend beyond a speaker's capacity to ascertain the extension of an expression. Third, it may be very tempting to expand the argument in question. One might think that one can introduce a check that can be performed for the confounding factors of the argument. One could conditionalise any inference drawn by means of the argument upon that. For example, suppose that when one is counting the eggs in the basket one aims to count not eggs in just any condition, but intact eggs. This is something that one has not checked for. So suppose one as it were, controls for this. One does a check for damaged eggs in each box, as well as counting the number of eggs in each box and the number of boxes. The equation employed in one's reasoning about the number of eggs in the basket is thereby expanded: Total eggs = (number in a box * number of boxes) – number of broken eggs. 127 However, this expansion of the argument will involve a new premise: there are z broken eggs. The argument thus expanded needs to satisfy the five conditions just outlined. There are many ways to detect whether an egg is broken and any one of them will be such that, on some occasions it enables one to make an accurate calculation but not on others. For instance, suppose one checks how many broken eggs there are by picking up each one in a box and performing a visual examination of the eggs. The trouble is, some eggs may be broken in a way that means they are not edible, for instance, but which would pass a visual inspection. In a circumstance in which that is indeed so, one's inference by means of the principle Total eggs = (number in a box * number of boxes) – number of broken eggs, thus applied, would be invalid. Expansion of an argument introduces an expanded problem.187 Fourth, notice that there is no greater reason to think that an argument that is probabilistic will avoid confounding factors than an argument that is not probabilistic. To illustrate, suppose a marble is taken from a sack in which were placed ten marbles: four black marbles and six red marbles. One might think that if one were to take a marble out at random, check its colour and then return it, one could notice that the proportion of times the marble was red was .6. But suppose one of the following is so: there is a paint canister that leaks inside the sack; there is a hole in the sack; the marbles are made of material that changes colour with the temperature. In such situations, that six red and four black marbles were placed in the sack means very little as regards the probability of withdrawing a red marble from the sack. A probabilistic argument still needs to be a valid argument if it is to support accurate predictions and it will be so only if the five conditions are met. But whether they are so will depend upon the circumstances. Fifth, one might accept that strictly speaking there is no I (array of application criteria) that is non-contingently balanced but still maintain that there are those that are good enough. For the most part it is reasonable to assume that the model thus applied will be in stable enough circumstances within which the I in question works satisfactorily. 187 See also (Hempel 1988, p.154) who, for this reason, distinguishes his requirement that a proviso condition be met when implementing a theory from the Duhem-Quine thesis. 128 But this is just to weaken the requirements of a good argument. To make an accurate prediction on the basis of observing such and such, the argument from that such and such to something else needs to be valid. Otherwise you are doing little better than guessing. Suppose someone conducts an experiment which aims to show that a certain drug cures depression. But suppose no one ever checked that there is a placebo effect. Can one draw the inference from observing a significant increase in recovery as compared with a control group that the drug contains chemicals which are active in the recoveries witnessed? No. It does not matter how large the apparent effect is. If the measurements were not conducted in such a way as to control for a placebo effect then inferences from the measurements taken are invalid inferences. They are not publishable and they should not be acted upon (by buying the drugs). Failures of balance do not leave in their wake arguments that are almost good enough but not quite. They are crippled. Sixth, notice that we have had to suppose that a conditional has its truth-value assigned directly rather than compositionally in order to allow for the possibility of being unbalanced. One might balk at this: conditionals do not have their truthvalues assigned directly but instead by means of the constituents of the sentence, viz. the truth-values of the antecedent and consequent. However, if this were true then one would not be able to engage in modus ponens or modus tollens inferences to extend one's knowledge. In modus ponens the truth-value of the antecedent and the truth-value of the conditional are determined vertically (neither is horizontally determined by the truth-value of other sentences, we may suppose) and they then horizontally determine the truth-value of the consequent. If it were not possible for the conditional to have a truth-value determined directly then this would not be possible. Something similar is equally applicable to modus tollens inferences. So we should not balk here. What might an application criterion for a conditional be? One is looking for situations such that, ―If A then B.‖ For instance, consider, ―if o1 is heavier than o2, o2 will be higher than o1‖ where o1 and o2 are objects placed at either end of a seesaw. One might adopt this conditional because the locations are the ends of a seesaw which one can see before one. Other candidates for application criteria of conditionals include: it's a hospital, so if they call your name, then the doctor will see you; it's a phone, so if you dial the number of the person you are trying to call, you will call the person you are trying to call; and so on. 129 3.4 Calibration We have now, not a knock-down justification of the contingency thesis but justification to accept it which seems to be robust enough to work with. I will henceforth suppose that it is true. If it is true, then one cannot apply an argument with fixed application criteria and reason with the argument validly. The argument for this new claim is as follows. Suppose that an argument is applied with fixed application criteria no matter the circumstances of application. We can express this using Hempel's empiricist construal combined with a formal semantics. Suppose the argument is expressed in a given formal semantics and we label the argument C. Suppose we label the application criteria for the expressions in the sentences in the argument I. Then we can speak of Hempel's empiricist construal as: T=<C, I>. Now consider: 1) T is applied by deploying a given I on all applications. We aim to show that (1) is not consistent with the utility of arguments in making accurate predictions about empirical states of affairs. That is, we aim to show that if (1) is true, then the argument in C is invalid. A standard understanding of what it is for an argument form to be valid is for it to not be possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. This notion is the one we will be using in this argument. However, another way to define validity is: a given argument form is valid iff when translated into a formal language, there are no models for the language on which the premises are true and the conclusion false. Talk of possible combinations of truth and falsehood is exchanged for talk of models on which claims within an argument are true or false. This notion of validity would render the present argument invalid because we will employ a notion of confounding which concerns how truth-values of sentences of C are determined that allows such determinations to diverge from the constraints of the semantic rules for the expressions of the formal semantics. The way in which one checks the validity of an argument on the second definition of validity is by ensuring that given the ways that truth-values of sentences are determined conform to the semantic rules of the language there is no model on which the premises are true, the conclusion false. Consider checking the validity of the argument stated in a predicate calculus which has the form: Fa; FaGa; Ga. One checks that there is no possible assignment of values to ―a‖, ―F‖, and ―G‖, such that the premises are true and conclusion false. 130 But what is counted as a possible assignment of values conforms to the constraints provided by the truth-conditions of ―‖. But since we are concerned to recognise the fact that there are circumstances in which assignments of values do not conform to such rules (failures of balance), there is a variety of failure to move from truth to truth that would go unrecognised on this second definition of validity. If the reader does not want to use the word ―valid‖ in our first sense then substitute the expression ―applied validity‖ or ―valid in application.‖ So we have: 2) C is a valid argument only if the conclusion of C cannot be false if the premises of C are true. Recall the contingency thesis. If it is true, then for all that has been done in applying the theory (on the empiricist construal), there can be confounding factors that have unbalanced the application criteria, i.e. I. So we have: 3) For any I, there will be some circumstances in which I is unbalanced. Given (1) and (3), there is nothing in how a theory is applied (on the empiricist construal) which distinguishes between those circumstances in which the theory would be unbalanced from those in which it would not. But then it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false, for all that has been done in the application. So we have the following conditional: 4) If C is applied without ensuring there are no confounding factors and there are some circumstances in which I is unbalanced, then it is possible for the premises of C to be true and the conclusion of C to be false. Now we can draw some inferences. Given (1), (3), (4) and modus ponens we have: 5) It is possible for the premises of C to be true and the conclusion of C to be false. But given (2), (5) and modus tollens we get: 6) C is not a valid argument. Thus from the contingency thesis, an assumption about validity, and the assumption that theories have embedded within them their own application 131 conditions, we can derive the conclusion that one cannot reason validly with theories that satisfy (1). One qualm one might have with this argument is that the notion of validity employed is too loose. If we do not define validity with respect to the ―for all models‖ notion then how are we to have a clear statement of when it is possible for a conclusion to follow from some premises? In response to this concern I say the following. The reason why we have considered another notion of validity is because if one relied just upon the ―for all models‖ notion of validity, one could employ a theory, think one is guaranteed a true conclusion, but fail to get one because the reason why this possibility is available is not registered by the ―for all models‖ notion of validity. In practice, whether one will get a true conclusion given true premises, depends upon whether the world is so arranged that the application criteria one employs in applying the theory return verdicts that are balanced. Whether the world is so arranged is not something one can check just by examining the form of the assumptions, and the individual application criteria, one employs in making the inference one does. So although we have had to employ another notion of validity, we did so for a reason. We may well crave the explicitness of the other definition but that doesn't justify employing only it in discussions of good and bad reasoning. An intuitive understanding of what can happen in particular circumstances will serve our purposes well enough. For what I want to be recognised is a reason why it would be a good thing if the speakers who operate linguistic expressions had the task of determining their extension as they use those expressions rather than that being settled in advance as a built-in, fixed feature of the language they speak. Once we recognise the problems of finding application criteria which enable accurate predictions to be made (or inferences to true conclusions to be drawn) regardless of the circumstances, we find such a reason. But to do that we have had to take into consideration factors which though present in real episodes of reasoning are abstracted away when discussing a formal semantics or logic in abstraction from actual episodes of reasoning. If one cannot reason validly with an argument with fixed application criteria, but to reason validly there needs to be a balanced array of application criteria, then, identifying a balanced array of application criteria is what the reasoner has to do when reasoning. It is not a task that can be presumed to have been handled already by the terms of the argument. If one is going to reason with a particular 132 theory, about a particular state of affairs, then one needs, in effect, to calibrate the argument's application criteria for valid reasoning in the circumstances. One has to find some array of application criteria which meets the five conditions described above. I will use this term (calibration) to speak of this process henceforth.188 4 Calibration: an illustration In this section we will look at an example of calibration. The example will illustrate the difference calibration makes to the validity (in application) of an argument expressed with natural language expressions with changes of circumstance. 4.1 A language game When Wittgenstein introduces the notion of a language game in his Investigations he means a unity of action and signs. (Wittgenstein 1958, p.5) Words are only a part of what is going on. Common to many uses of linguistic expressions will be the application of a semantic calculus. If the expressions employed conform to the rules of a formal semantic calculus then one can reason with those expressions: one can (in the epistemic sense) determine the truth-value of one sentence from the truthvalues of others and have this be more than a syntactic exercise, i.e. by means of it one can learn about how things are before, or without, learning how they are directly. We will call this language game ―reasoning with a calculus.‖ We will consider a case in which this is what someone seeks to do. Although this game is an abstraction (something common to many different uses to which linguistic expressions can be put) it is nonetheless an activity which can be embedded within the variety of which Wittgenstein's list of language games is suggestive.189 188 Compare: ―I believe that I can best make the relation of my ideography to ordinary language clear if I compare it to that which the microscope has to the eye. Because of the range of its possible uses and the versatility with which it can adapt to the most diverse circumstances, the eye is far superior to the microscope.‖ (Frege 1879 [1997], p.49) The way Frege continues, it is clear he intends the analogy to be: formal language is to natural language as the microscope is to the naked eye. I think the better analogy is: formal language is to natural language as the uncalibrated eye is to an eye in use (possibly with a microscope). The formal element is always present in the form of the logico-syntactic structures unearthed by semanticists. But that alone is always in need of being calibrated so ―it can adapt to the most diverse circumstances.‖ 189 (Wittgenstein 1958, p.11): giving orders and obeying them; describing the appearance of an object, giving its measurements, constructing an object from a description, reporting an event, speculating about an event, forming a test or hypothesis, making up a story, reading a story, play-acting, singing catches, guessing riddles, making a joke, telling a joke, solving 133 Suppose Holiday sits in front of a piece of paper with a pencil. Before her is a scene with elements within it. She knows the rules and expressions of a semantic calculus. She can write out sentences on the paper and modify them in accordance with the rules given various stipulated models for the linguistic expressions employed. She wants to use the expressions and rules to reason about the scene before her. Because of this she will not settle for stipulated models. She wants application criteria for her expressions which make the truth-values of sentences depend upon elements of the scene before her. Because of this, not only do there need to be application criteria for the expressions she employs but those employed need to be balanced. Otherwise, reasoning in accordance with the rules of the calculus will lead her to expect something that does not happen. Suppose the argument she uses to reason about the scene before her is this: the leaves were green and the leaves were processed; if the leaves were green and the leaves were processed then the leaves glow red; the leaves glow red. As well as the logical connectives ―If...then‖ and ―and‖ there are the following expressions in this stretch of reasoning: NPthe leaves Predwere green Predwere processed Predglow red What about the application criteria for these expressions? Suppose that the application criterion for ―were processed‖ is as follows. The leaves were baked so they dry. They were then ground in a mortar and pestle. They were then mixed with a solvent in a test tube and left to settle for a day. The solids were then removed leaving only the fluid. Depending upon whether or not this process has taken place is how one counts items as within the extension of ―were processed.‖ What is the significance of processing leaves? Chlorophyll is found in naturally green leaves. Chlorophyll pigment will glow orange-red when placed under UVlight. Red leaves which have been painted green will not do this. Suppose that the application criterion for the conditional in the argument is that this is how leaves a problem in practical arithmetic, translating from one language into another, asking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying. 134 have been found to behave by various experiments. If those experiments had produced different results, then one would classify these sentences as having different truth-values. Suppose the application criterion for ―glow red‖ is that the leaves fluoresce an orange-red when placed under a UV-light in an otherwise dark room. Suppose how leaves are counted is by their shape and texture. Holiday has developed a feel for what is leaf-like in this respect and exercises this recognitional capacity in the circumstances. We will consider two application criteria for ―were green.‖ On the first, one simply examines the surface colour of the object in London sunlight. If the leaves look green under such conditions, then they are classified as green. If not, then not. Call this the surface criterion. On the second, one slices the leaves to examine whether their interior is green. If so, then they are classified as in the extension of ―were green‖ if not then not. Call this the inner criterion. 4.2 Four possibilities Suppose that Holiday attempts to reason with the above argument about what happens in the scene before her. Regardless of the application criterion of ―were green‖ the sentences are operated in accordance with the same rules. These are the relevant rules from our toy semantics. We will now consider what happens if we vary two factors. Firstly, the application criterion of ―were green‖ and secondly the circumstances (what kind of leaves are in the scene before her). For each possibility we will describe a model for the basic non-logical expressions of the argument. The model describes what falls within non-logical basic expressions' extensions according to the verdicts of application criteria operated in a given environment. But because a conditional can have its truth-value determined by its own application criterion (so that, recall, one can engage in modus ponens or modus tollens inferences), it is possible for the truth-value of a sentence determined horizontally to diverge from its truth-value determined vertically. In that case, the calculus is unbalanced and reasoning done in accordance with its semantic rules is invalid (in application). We will consider how whether the argument is balanced varies between the four possibilities and hence whether Holiday's reasoning is valid (in application) in each case. 135 The first case we will consider is reasoning with the surface criterion while there are leaves present that have been painted green. In this case we could expect a model that looks like the following, M3: D = {a} i1 i2 i3 F(leaves)(in) = {a} {a} {a} i1 i2 i3 F(are processed)(in) = {} {a} {} i1 i2 i3 F(are green)(in) = {a} {} {} i1 i2 i3 F(glow red)(in) = {} {} {} There is an object a. By the criteria employed it counts as leaves. At time i1 the leaves do not count as processed, they do count as green, and they do not count as red. At time i2 the leaves count as processed, but not as green and not as glowing red. Then at i3 they do not count as being processed, as being green, or as glowing red. The rules of the calculus thus deployed provide a horizontal determination of the truth-value of the sentence ―The leaves glow red‖ which diverges from that of the vertical determination of its truth-value. This is because the application criteria by which one operates the sentences will be such that I([S [NP The leaves][Pred were green]])M3,w,i3,c,g = 1, I([S [NP the leaves] [Pred were processed]])M3,w,i3,c,g = 1, and I([S If [S [S [NP the leaves] [Pred were green]] [conj and] [S [NP the leaves] [Pred were processed]] then [S [NP the leaves] [Pred glow red]]])M3,w,i3,c,g = 1. But if they are true then the rules of the formal semantics allow one to derive I([S [NP The leaves][Pred glow red]])M3,w,i3,c,g = 1. For if they are true but I([S [NP The leaves][Pred glow red]])M3,w,i3,c,g = 0 then according to the semantic rule for ―If...then...‖ I([S If [S [S [NP the leaves] [Pred are green]] [conj and] [S [NP the leaves] [Pred are processed]] then [S [NP the leaves] [Pred glow red]]])M3,w,i3,c,g = 0, contrary to fact. So in the circumstances, if one employs the 136 present application criterion for ―are green‖ and the relevant one for the conditional, and if one follows the rules of the calculus, one will draw a false conclusion. The vertical determination of I([S [NP The leaves][Pred glow red]])M3,w,i3,c,g leads to one truth-value and the horizontal determination of I([S [NP The leaves][Pred glow red]])M3,w,i3,c,g leads to the opposite truth-value. Now suppose again that the surface application criterion for ―were green‖ is employed but, in contrast to the previous case, there are no painted leaves present. Then one's reasoning with the sentences would be unproblematic. In this case, the linguistic expressions operated with the same application criteria would conform to a model like M4: D = {a} i1 i2 i3 F(leaves)(in) = {a} {a} {a} i1 i2 i3 F(are processed)(in) = {} {a} {} i1 i2 i3 F(are green)(in) = {a} {a} {a} i1 i2 i3 F(glow red)(in) = {} {} {a} Now the vertical determination of the truth-value of ―The leaves glow red‖ would coincide with truth-value provided by a horizontal determination, given the application criteria and the rules of the calculus in operation. When the world and the linguistic expressions are so arranged, one will not derive a falsehood while following the rules of the formal semantics. Thus a difference in circumstance can change whether a calculus is balanced, when its expressions are operated in accordance with certain application criteria. This is what the examples from the previous chapter illustrated too. But in the present 137 example we see this phenomenon in relation to more mundane reasoning than that which involves scientific terms like ―magnet,‖ ―force,‖ and ―intact axon.‖ Now turn to the inner criterion for ―were green.‖ If this were employed then the presence of painted leaves will not pose a threat to the (applied) validity of one's reasoning because one will not classify painted leaves as green unless they are also green on the inside. So operated, the vertical determination of the extensions of expressions would result in the following, M5: D = {a} i1 i2 i3 F(leaves)(in) = {a} {a} {a} i1 i2 i3 F(are processed)(in) = {} {a} {} i1 i2 i3 F(are green)(in) = {} {} {} i1 i2 i3 F(glow red)(in) = {} {} {} One could not employ the rules of the calculus to derive I([S [NP The leaves][Pred glow red]])M5,w,i3,c,g = 1 because the vertical determinations of the truth-value of the premises of the argument return a verdict of 0. So in this case one would not be led into deriving a falsehood because one would not be led into deriving anything. Similarly, if there were no painted leaves present then there would be no problem here either. The model would not diverge from M5. This concludes our four possibilities. Thus with changes in application criteria and in the circumstances in which given application criteria are employed, there are changes in whether the application criteria are balanced and hence in whether the vertical and horizontal determinations of the truth-value of a sentence coincide and hence, in turn, whether reasoning with the calculus thus applied will be valid in application. Holiday, sitting in her chair, attempting to reason about the scene before her with 138 her expressions, rules, pencil and paper needs to change how she operates the expressions in accordance with the demands of the circumstances. She needs to calibrate what she counts as satisfying the predicate ―are green‖ and what falls within the extension in the circumstances of the other linguistic expressions she employs so that, in those circumstances, she can reason validly (in application) about the condition of items in those circumstances. One might object that the second criterion is the better criterion tout court. In which case, if only we had used the better criterion, there would be no need to calibrate. However, this is not true. In some cases employing it will be a mistake. To illustrate how, consider the use of ―are green‖ in a different stretch of reasoning to that considered just now.190 Suppose one uses the following sentences as part of a calculus that operates in accordance with our toy semantics: if the leaves are painted then the leaves will be green; the leaves are painted; so the leaves will be green. Suppose the application criterion for ―are painted‖ is that a paintbrush covered in green painted is applied to the leaves and pastes the leaves in green paint. Suppose that one classifies items as falling within the extension of ―are green‖ if they appear green upon visual inspection (the surface criterion). Similarly for ―are red.‖ One's reasoning can be valid (in application) even if the leaves were red and only end up being green on their surface. This is because the extensions of the constituent expressions would be as in M6: D = {a} i1 i2 i3 F(leaves)(in) = {a} {a} {a} i1 i2 i3 F(are green)(in) = {} {} {a} 190 The temporal difference between the current and the previous example is inessential to the point being made. If you think it is then add a further time to the model i4 and use ―were green‖ in the examples with the sentences evaluated related to i4. The result is the same as it will be in the present discussion. But we would need to add in a temporal distinction between the time in the past when the leaves were green and the time in the past when the leaves were red, e.g. ―at 2pm‖ and ―at 220pm.‖ We can avoid this complication if we modify the formulation from the previous example. 139 i1 i2 i3 F(are red)(in) = {a} {a} {} i1 i2 i3 F(paint)(in) = {} {a} {} The rules of the calculus combined with the surface criteria, in the circumstances described, would result in the same truth-value being determined for I([S [NP The leaves] [Pred are green]])M6,w,i3,c,g horizontally as it is vertically; namely, 1. But this could fail to be so. For instance, suppose the leaves present begin red on the surface without having been painted but are throughout i1-i3 white on the inside.191 Suppose the leaves become painted as before and that the same application criteria are employed as before. Then although one would reason as one did before, the actual model for one's words would be, M7: D = {a, b} i1 i2 i3 F(leaves)(in) = {a} {a} {a} i1 i2 i3 F(are green)(in) = {} {} {} i1 i2 i3 F(are white)(in) = {a} {a} {a} i1 i2 i3 F(paint)(in) = {} {a} {} In this case while I([S [NP The leaves][Pred are green]])M7,w,i3,c,g would have the truthvalue 0 determined vertically, it would have the truth-value 1 determined 191 Suppose they have been grown with an inhibiter of pigment to their interior only. Pyke, Zubko, and Day (2000) describe how this can be done for green leaves. Let us suppose it can be done for red leaves. 140 horizontally. Thus the inner criterion, for some purposes, in some circumstances, can equally well lead to an unbalanced calculus as can the surface criterion. 5 Calibration and Travis cases How does all this relate to the usual discussions to be found of that tired sentence ―The leaves are green‖? The sentence usually arises in connection with Pia and her russet leaves: Pia's Japanese maple is full of russet leaves. Believing that green is the colour of leaves, she paints them. Returning, she reports,  That's better. The leaves are green now.' She speaks truth. A botanist friend then phones, seeking green leaves for a study of green-leaf chemistry.  The leaves (on my tree) are green,' Pia says.  You can have those.' But now Pia speaks falsehood. (Travis 1997 [2008], p.111). I have not approached the sentence via this passage. I have not attempted to elicit intuitions about whether one would say it is true or false under such and such circumstances. What I have tried to do is evaluate how different criteria for determining (in the metaphysical sense) whether it is true or false would be more or less useful for using the sentence when reasoning with the sentence as part of a calculus of linguistic expressions, in different circumstances. We have found that in different circumstances in which the reasoning is done (and with different stretches of reasoning) different application criteria would better serve one's purposes in the use to which one puts the sentence. Notice that in the story Travis tells the different stretches of reasoning we considered each have a natural place. When Pia is announcing her accomplishment in turning the leaves green, she appears very much to be comparing their current condition with how they were at an earlier time. She is employing her sentence as part of an argument that looks like the second argument we considered. Pia's words in response to her friend's request appear very much to be a case in which the leaves are being related192 to how they would behave under certain experimental manipulations, e.g. by isolating their pigment and shining it under a UV-light in an otherwise dark room. So something like the first argument we considered is what her sentence would figure within when she is responding to her 192 At least, by ourselves and her friend. 141 friend's request for green leaves. In each case exactly how one counts things as green or not may need to change as between the two cases if one wants to employ the sentence in valid (in application) reasoning. If a process of calibration is going on in the use of the predicate ―is green‖ for reasoning about the leaves' relation to different collections of other items (in different circumstances) then the fluctuation of extension witnessed in different uses of the same predicate for different purposes is exactly what one should expect. The predicate is being put to work in different calculi which need the predicate to be differently calibrated if the calculi are to enable valid (in application) reasoning. This is no less a plausible thing to say for other Travis cases. Here is another example: Story I: Smith is quite proud of the results of the rigorous diet he has followed. He has lost easily 15kg. Stepping on the scales one morning, he notes with satisfaction that they register a thick hair or two below 80 kilos. At the office, he proudly announces,  I now weigh 80 kilos.' But the tiresome Melvin replies,  What! In that heavy tweed suit? Not very likely.' and, pulling a bathroom scale out of his bottom desk drawer and pushing Smith on to it, notes with satisfaction,  Look. 83 and a bit.' (For good measure, let us suppose Smith not yet to have taken off his overcoat, so that the scale actually reads 86.) Of course, we would say, what Melvin has demonstrated does not count against what Smith said. (Contrasting) Story II: Smith, dressed in the last way, is about to step into a crowded elevator.  Wait a minute.', someone says, This elevator is really very delicate. We can only take 80 more kilos.'  Coincidentally, that's exactly what I weigh,' replies Smith. In he steps, and down they plummet. So it appears that what Smith said this time is false. (Travis 1985, pp.199-200) These are two stories in which an unambiguous, non-elliptical, not-relevantlyindexical sentence is used. The sentence has different truth-values in each story but is used to speak of the same object in the same condition in each story. Notice how the item spoken of in the use of the sentence is spoken of in relation to different collections of items. In the first story, Smith is comparing his current condition to how he was whenever he last measured his weight (for purposes of maintaining one's figure). The way one checks one's weight is to weigh oneself at 142 different time intervals in the same condition each time, whatever that was. We can see that this makes a difference to how Smith ought to weigh himself if he is concerned with whether he has lost weight. To know he has lost weight by standing on the scales he must know what he weighed at some previous time, viz. 95kg. But if he weighed himself last time while fully clothed, then in Travis' first story what the man says would be false. The way in which the predicate ―weighs less than 80kg‖ is to be employed, i.e. with what application criterion, depends upon both how he weighed himself last time and the fact that he is comparing numbers and wants to derive a conclusion about having lost some weight since last weighing. But things are different in the second story. There, how he weighed himself the last time he weighed himself does not matter. What matters now is the relation between Smith's current condition and the workings of the elevator. Smith and the someone want to be able to use the predicate ―weighs less than 80kg‖ in such a way that it can be used to reason about what would happen if Smith stepped onto the elevator. To do that a different application criterion for the predicate is needed than whatever number the scales turned to that morning, given the discrepancy in the materials hanging from Smith's body between those two occasions. However, as with the first story, this need not be so. If for instance, Smith is on holiday at a nudist camp and the way he measured himself in the morning was the way he would enter the elevator, then there is nothing wrong with using the number the scale turned to that morning as a criterion for satisfying the predicate ―weigh less than 80kg‖ for the purposes of reasoning about what will happen if Smith steps onto the elevator (given suitable application criteria for other linguistic expressions one uses in this reasoning).193 In sum, we have reason to do something which if we were to do it, would lead to the occurrence of Travis cases. This ―something‖ is the calibration of the expressions employed in applied reasoning. If we did not do this, then our capacity to reason 193 The reader may have wondered about possible connections between OS and Goodman's (1979 [1983]) riddle. We can think of Goodman's specification of how to use certain predicates as specifications of application criteria for employing them. A bent predicate is one that involves changing the application criteria in some circumstance (Goodman happens to pick on time, but this seems inessential). Goodman thought we needed a way to distinguish bent from non-bent predicates because bent predicates are bad predicates. I think we actively go about bending our predicates for use in particular circumstances because we do not possess knowledge of ways of applying predicates which enable valid inferences regardless of the circumstances (the threat of confounding factors). In a sense analogous to what Evans (1985) had in mind when he said it for demonstratives, we have to run to keep still. 143 with linguistic expressions as elements of a semantic calculus would be put at risk. If this is a correct genealogy of the context-sensitivity witnessed in Travis cases then a paraphrase of Harold Garfinkel's words adequately captures the current sentiment: to try expunging context-sensitivity from one's analysis of language use is to try tearing down the walls of a building so that one can get a better look at what holds up the roof.194 It is as important an element of language use as phonology or grammar and just as optional. 5.1 Analysing a scene We arrive at the following image of an applied reasoner. A reasoner can analyse one scene in many different ways. She breaks it down into elements, which she divides into some categories, and she identifies some principles relating the categories and their membership. She could associate the categories and items with particular linguistic expressions. But there is no reason why she needs to do so. We might think of an expression in a semantic calculus as playing a functional-role defined by the principles in which it figures (primarily, the syntactic and semantic rules to which it is subject), and its extension/intension. Let us call this an analysis of a scene. Some analyses will enable valid (in application) reasoning about the scene and some will not.195 None of this is to rule out the possibility that there is one universe-wide analysis that could be provided in the terms of some future science. This allows us to address an obvious shortcoming of the current treatment of Travis cases. That treatment speaks of other sentences with which the analysed sentence (e.g. ―The leaves are green‖) is related. But no such sentences are provided in statements of Travis cases. Nonetheless, the analysed sentence may well be being employed to speak of some item as part of a scene, as we can say, under a given analysis. 194 (Garfinkel 1967, p.22) 195 Goffman (1974, chapter 7) provides numerous examples of how some elements of a scene are ignored while others are taken into consideration in thinking about a scene and Goffman's (1974, chapter 9) examples of ―misframings‖ illustrate ordinary ways in which this can go awry. See also (Camp 2004). 144 5.2 Calibration, further factor views, and OS If the contingency thesis is granted, so there is a need to engage in calibration, then a further factor analysis of Travis cases is a mistake. For as I have emphasised previously, if one introduces more factors into one's semantic analysis, then these have to have their values, on occasion, determined by how things are somehow. Consider, for example, MacFarlane's ―counts as‖ parameter.196 MacFarlane's idea is that one can eliminate Travis cases from a semantic analysis of a sentence by introducing a parameter which changes its value with context but that when it has a given value, and when the other elements of the semantic analysis are held constant, there is no possibility of fluctuation in the truth-value of the sentence analysed across different instances of it. However, as Predelli noted, there are different ways in which the user of a linguistic expression might count the ―counts as‖ parameter as having a given value across different instances of the sentence analysed.197 The point should be well taken. If you add in new factors whose values need to be determined vertically (as does MacFarlane's ―counts as‖ parameter, and as would any other parameter one cares to add) but there are various ways to do this which are employed on different instances of the sentence analysed, then the additional parameter would not halt changes in the truth-value of the sentence across different instances.198 Since the ways values are assigned to these parameters will vary in whether they are capable of supporting valid reasoning, there is a reason to expect the ways in which such parameters get their values to vary. Hence, adding more factors into the semantic analysis will not result in the removal of the phenomenon exhibited in Travis cases from the linguistic expressions one is offering the analysis for.199 So if the contingency thesis is granted, no further factor analysis of a sentence will eliminate Travis cases.200 Furthermore, we would have reason to reject the hypothesis. The hypothesis recall is that there are long regularities in the substantial extensions of expressions of natural languages. This requires there to be some semantic analysis (possibly 196 (MacFarlane 2007) 197 (Predelli 2005a) 198 See my discussion of Predelli in Chapter II for further explanation. 199 The move is akin to one objection to the contingency thesis we discussed earlier: expanding the argument. 200 Again, his words are appropriate: ―...not only does no concept of context-in-general exist, but every use of ―context‖ without exception is itself essentially indexical.‖ (Garfinkel 1967, p.10) 145 involving psychological elements) of expressions that would allow us in principle to describe an invariant model for that semantic analysis for the duration of time for which it is true that someone speaks a language. Suppose that language users, being as they are capable reasoners, only use linguistic expressions with which they can reason. Then the regularity that would make true the hypothesis is possible only if the users of the language have in their possession application criteria for their linguistic expressions which are non-contingently balanced when they formulate arguments with them. But if the contingency thesis is true, then this is not so. So for any such users of linguistic expressions they could not operate the expressions in conformity with the hypothesis while employing the expressions to reason validly (in application).201 In particular, we have found reason to reject the hypothesis as it applies to predicates and their extensions and not just as it applies to NPs and their extensions (something which, perhaps, many already accept for some NPs). Calibration involves changing the application criteria of expressions so that whether the referent of an NP falls within the extension of a given predicate changes. In cases in which one aims to reason about the referent of the NP, it is the extension of the predicate that is going to change to enable valid (in application) reasoning. This we have seen in our examples. This reason for accepting OS slips into neither of the two problems facing Travis' own arguments for the thesis. The argument from cases enters a stymied situation because opponents of OS (if they recognise it is OS they are opposing) propose halfarticulated further factor analyses that cannot be tested because of their halfarticulation. The current strategy has not been to find counterexamples to each analysis provided by an opponent but instead to find a general reason why any analysis provided should be understood as documenting a transient regularity insofar as it documents substantial extensions. Given the soundness of the argument for this conclusion, we do not have to wait for filibustering analysts to complete their analyses or find somebody else (in another discipline) to do it for them. The two Wittgensteinian arguments, at best, establish only that there is a role for good judgement in using linguistic expressions. But that is not inconsistent 201 One might object that to accept the contingency thesis just is to accept OS. But this is incorrect. The contingency thesis concerns application criteria that are available. The hypothesis concerns a regularity in the use of linguistic expressions. The contingency thesis could be true while the hypothesis is also true. In such a case the language users would use the linguistic expressions and reason badly. So the truth of the contingency thesis is not identical to rejection of the hypothesis but it is a reason to expect the hypothesis to be false. 146 with there being available a semantic analysis that documents a long regularity in the substantial extensions of expressions. If the contingency thesis is true, and if users of linguistic expressions competently use those expressions to reason, then there will be no long regularities in the substantial extensions of expressions. To operate expressions thus would be to adopt a natural language analogue of Hempel's empiricist construal and to reason hazardously. This argument for OS diverges from Travis' attempts in an important respect. Whereas he plays up the conventionality of an expression's extension, I have attempted to play down just that element of the usage of expressions for certain purposes. Like badly built buildings and bridges, badly rigged semantic calculi are bound to collapse not because everyone agrees that that is so but because that is just how the world works. Nonetheless, I do not think the reason provided here for linguistic expressions of natural languages to exhibit variations in extensions and intensions is knockdown. The principal aim for providing it is to turn the tables on what appears to be a default starting position: the hypothesis. But if application criteria are limited in their capacity to support valid reasoning, then the default starting point should be that speakers have to calibrate semantic calculi for the purposes at hand in the sense of ―calibrate‖ I have attempted to explain in the previous pages. 147 PART II 148 C H A P T E R V Stenius' attitude and the incompatibility argument 1 Introduction Even if we grant that calibration is to be expected and that calibration requires OS, we have yet to explain why OS does not create an explanatory lacuna in the simple model of communication. The remainder of this thesis is an attempt to address this concern. Our task in the current chapter is to understand why there is thought to be an incompatibility between OS and communication. 2 Communication The critic claims communication is not possible if the hypothesis is rejected. So what shall we understand by the word ―communication‖? Consider two interlocutors A and B and some state of affairs C, such as A's flat being on fire. Suppose B is aware of C but A is not. Nonetheless, A is in a position to observe B produce linguistic expressions with properties such as referents, satisfiers, and truth-conditions. When such an arrangement obtains it is possible for A to learn of C by observing B produce sentences. B functions for A as a window onto the part of the world where C obtains. This will be familiar as ―the simple model of communication‖ described in the thesis Introduction. Obviously many other things might be spoken of with the word ―communication‖ but they are not being spoken of here. When the truth-conditions are substantial, the arrangement just described 149 requires at least that A be able to recognise how things would have to be for the sentences B utters to be true.202 3 The doubters We will now collect a sample of those who think that communication is not compatible with the hypothesis' falsity. What reason(s) do they provide for thinking that there is such incompatibility? Eighty years ago Leonard Bloomfield put forward something very much like the hypothesis as none other than ―the fundamental assumption of linguistics‖: ...phonology and, with it, all the semantic phase of language study, rests upon an assumption, the fundamental assumption of linguistics: we must assume that in every speech-community some utterances are alike in form and meaning. (Bloomfield 1933 [1979], p.78) It is made clear in chapter 2 of Bloomfield's book that a ―speech community‖ is to be understood as a collection of individuals whose use of linguistic expressions exhibits long regularities of the kind with which we are concerned. It is also clear that in this passage ―meaning‖ is used to speak of something analogous to substantial truth-conditions.203 By ―utterances‖ Bloomfield intends to speak of the production of linguistic expressions.204 With these glosses we can see that the passage makes the following claim: there is a long regularity in the substantial truth-conditions of the sentences of a given community of speakers. That is none other than the hypothesis. Bloomfield offers the following reason for adopting this assumption: In the rough, our assumption is justified by the mere fact that speakers cooperate in a very refined way by means of language-signals. (Bloomfield 1933 [1979], p.158) If we can safely assume (and I think this much is obvious) that arrangements in which ―speakers co-operate in a very refined way by means of language-signals‖ includes within its remit communication as we defined it then Bloomfield justifies 202 I say  at least' because other requirements, such as the speaker's competence and honesty may be required for A to learn on the basis of B's production of sounds, marks, or gestures. 203 See (Bloomfield 1933 [1979], p.27) 204 See (Bloomfield 1933 [1979], pp.22-23) 150 his adoption of the hypothesis by the existence of communication. The implication is that without the hypothesis' truth, there would be no communication. Bloomfield does not explain why we should think this.205 Erik Stenius makes the same claim as Bloomfield, ―[w]ithout rules for linguistic usage all linguistic communication is impossible.‖206 This claim embodies an attitude, says Stenius, toward language.207 For this reason, I will refer to the purported need for long regularities in the substantial truth-conditions (etc.) of sentences (etc.) for communication to be possible as ―Stenius' attitude.‖ Unlike Bloomfield, Stenius goes further than merely adopting this attitude. He offers the following argument in favour of it: If there were no rules of usage common to the speaker and the listener, any utterance in a language could have any meaning whatsoever. So, even though the rules of usage change according to place, time and social group, it is fundamental to all linguistic communication that the individuals speaking with one another should follow roughly the same rules. Any form of linguistics must describe the prevailing linguistic usage in some group at some time, and this is exactly the rules for linguistic communication which at that time are valid in this group. Every  linguistic usage' has its rules. I should like to call them its rules for the correct use of language. (Stenius 1967, p.258) 205 W. V. O. Quine shares this conception of a linguistic community: a community of the similarly disposed toward linguistic expressions and what counts as a condition of their truth (etc.). If we suppose, as is reasonable, that by ―meaning‖ Quine means to speak of something with the same substance as what we speak of with ―truth-conditions,‖ the opening lines of Word and Object simply take it for granted that there are dispositions of this sort which begin their life when one learns the language: Language is a social art. In acquiring it we have to depend entirely on intersubjectively available cues as to what to say and when. Hence there is no justification for collating linguistic meanings, unless in terms of men's dispositions to respond overtly to socially observable stimulations. (Quine 1960, p.ix) See also (Quine 1960, p.27). However, Quine for the most part seeks to justify only the assumption that that to which a speaker's use of her signs is responsive must be publically available. He does not seek to justify the assumption that there is a regularity in to what speakers apply their signs. He simply takes this for granted. A possible exception is the remark that the uniformity in use of expressions, ―comes where it matters socially‖ (Quine 1960, p.8), but apparently this is not the predominant impetus guiding Quine's thinking. 206 (Stenius 1967, p.258) 207 (Stenius 1967, p.257) 151 Let us suppose that an utterance is an instance of a sentence. Then Stenius claims that if there were no ―rules of usage common to the speaker and listener‖ then an instance of a sentence, ―could have any meaning whatsoever.‖ By a ―meaning‖ Stenius means, for sentences, something like substantial truth-conditions: conditions under which the sentence is to be classified as true or as false. Stenius cannot mean here that given that a speaker uses the sentence one way and a listener another (they count different conditions of the world as the truthconditions of the sentence), the sentence a speaker uses could have any of many different truth-conditions. For in such a circumstance, it has two adequately defined truth-conditions. It may be ambiguous but it does not fail to have any truth-conditions at all. No, the right way to read the proposal is to take the ―could‖ as epistemic. If the speaker and hearer employ the sentences in different ways, then for all the hearer knows, the speaker's sentences as used by her could have any truth-conditions whatsoever. Stenius cannot however mean that all it takes for the speaker and hearer to be landed in this epistemic predicament is that they employ the sentences in different ways. For if the hearer knew how the speaker used her sentences, despite that usage being different from the way he uses those same sentences, then there is no reason to doubt that he would know what the truth-conditions are of those sentences.208 Furthermore, there is a sense in which speaker and hearer can use a sentence in the same way even though the sentences have different truth-conditions when produced from the mouth of each. A template for this is ―I‖ for which we could say (perhaps incorrectly) that the referent of the expression is the person who utters it. Then two people use it the same way even if the referent is different depending upon who uses it. There could be a community of speakers who use sentences whose truth-conditions vary like this. So Stenius must instead mean to describe a situation in which the hearer does not know what the speaker's rules of usage are, even though she herself uses the expressions with such and such truth-conditions. But if that is all he means, then what he says is trivial. Of course if the hearer does not know how the speaker is using her words, then he does not know how she is using her words. However, once again there is a more plausible reading. The idea is: the hearer cannot identify what rules the speaker is following, and so what the truth-conditions are of the sentences she employs, just by examining her use of the sentences in the communicative episode. 208 It is true that Stenius does not explicitly state that this is not what he is thinking but read reasonably this is what he intends. 152 So the hearer must know in advance what the speaker's rules are if she is to know the truth-conditions of the speaker's sentences when the hearer observes the utterance of those sentences. Otherwise, communication is not possible. This is I think what Stenius is proposing. This idea is implicit in David Lewis' treatment of language use.209 He proposes that we model communicative exchanges as coordination problems. A coordination problem is, roughly, the following. There are two agents, A and B. There is a recurrent situation in which each has the choice of doing a range of actions a1...an. Which action each agent prefers to do depends upon what action the other agent prefers to do: there is a state of interdependent decision between A and B's choices. So we have combinations of actions performed by A and B. If there is more than one equally preferred combination, then on each occasion on which the recurrent situation arises, there is a coordination problem because there are at least two options that are equally preferable but somehow A and B need to choose between them. How is language use a coordination problem? Lewis makes the proposal in the following way. Roughly though adequately, a convention (for Lewis) is a solved coordination problem. He says: A population's common use of some one language-Welsh, say-is a convention. The Welshmen in parts of Wales use Welsh; each uses Welsh because he expects his neighbors to, and for the sake of communication he wishes to use whatever language his neighbors use. (Lewis 1969, p.49) The recurrent situation is one of communication. The actions available to different interlocutors are the use of linguistic expressions in certain ways (in the case of sentences, to classify them as true or false in certain conditions). Call each way of using linguistic expressions a language. This is a technical use of the word ―language‖; a fact to which we will return shortly. Each interlocutor prefers to use a given language if the other interlocutor does. But there is more than one language that they could both use. So there is a coordination problem. But hold on. Why assume that interlocutors' preferences are conditional upon the languages employed by other interlocutors? An alternative is that a speaker employs a 209 (Lewis 1969) 153 language without regard to what the other interlocutor uses, provided the other interlocutor will understand her, whatever her choice is. Lewis considers exactly this objection to his proposal: Does he not rather wish to use whatever language his neighbours will understand? Yes; but as a fact of human nature, he and his neighbors will best understand the language they use. So the right thing to say is that he wishes to use the language they use because that is the language they will understand. It follows that this is another case of coordination over time: he wishes to use the language they have been using most over a period in the past, a period long enough for them to have become skilled in its use.‖ (Lewis 1969, p.49) Bearing in mind the technical use of the word ―language,‖ Lewis here proposes that one's preference to use a language that one's interlocutors understand just is to prefer to use a language that one's interlocutor already uses. But this is what is currently at issue. It would not be true if the following were so. The neighbours have a capacity to recognise how the speaker is using her sentences however she is using them, by simply watching her use those sentences, even if they have not been using the sentences in that way. If this were granted, then Lewis' assumption would be false. So Lewis must be supposing that this cannot be granted. He must be supposing, that is, that one can only know how someone is using her sentences (or more generally linguistic expressions) if she is using them the same way she has done in the past, and one has studied how she has used them in the past. Before moving on from Lewis, let us briefly return to the fact that Lewis uses the word ―language‖ in the technical way that he does. The proposal that one can recognise how a speaker is using her sentences without having studied her use of them in the past while presuming that she uses the same as she did then, can sound fantastic. It can sound fantastic because it can sound like the following, distinct, proposal is being made: one can understand someone who speaks, for instance, Spanish, despite having never studied Spanish oneself, simply by observing her speak in Spanish. That proposal is fantastic. It can look as though our proposal is this proposal because Lewis uses the word ―language‖ in his discussion. The ordinary way to use the word ―language‖ in expressions like, ―to speak a language,‖ is to characterise speaking Spanish etc. But Lewis is not in fact 154 using the word ―language‖ in that way. He is using the word to speak of using sentences with such and such substantial truth-conditions, for instance. That need not be, and if one is rejecting the hypothesis, will not be, identified with speaking a language in the more ordinary sense of being able to speak Spanish. When this identification is avoided, our proposal is only as fantastic as the proposal that speakers can recognise the truth-conditions of a sentence as used by a speaker on a given occasion of speaking, without the speaker conforming to a regularity in this which the hearer has learnt in advance. One cannot take the difficulty of understanding a Spanish speaker without training in Spanish as evidence against this claim because to do so one must first assume that to speak Spanish is to be in possession of knowledge of the substantial truth-conditions of Spanish sentences. But that is the hypothesis currently up for discussion. Somewhat more recently, Donald Davidson rejected the hypothesis: We must give up the idea of a clearly defined shared structure which language-users acquire and then apply to cases. And we should try again to say how convention in any important sense is involved in language; or, as I think, we should give up the attempt to illuminate how we communicate by appeal to conventions. (Davidson 1986, p.265) Respondents to his proposal adopt Stenius' attitude. Marga Reimer claims that unless ―the meanings [of linguistic expressions] to be discerned [in communication] are grounded in conventions, in learned regularities, the hearer will have to engage in impromptu interpretation. And, as we have just seen, such interpretations are sometimes far from successful.‖210 So Reimer too supposes that an interlocutor cannot simply recognise the truth-conditions of a speaker's sentences as used by her without great difficulty.211 Jennifer Hornsby deploys the same attitude: ...prior shared knowledge of what artificial devices mean would seem to be necessary for communication as we know it. (Hornsby 2009, pp.116-117) 210 (Reimer 2004, p.324) 211 She appears to go further than the other three philosophers by alluding to evidence she has that there is this difficulty. The examples Reimer provides to illustrate how impromptu interpretations are sometimes ―far from successful‖ are malapropisms in which she casts doubt on whether we would resolve such mis-speakings easily in real circumstances. I think such evidence indicates only that there are cases and cases, as reflected in her hedge, ―sometimes.‖ 155 If we can suppose ―mean‖ is here being used to speak of, for sentences, substantial truth-conditions, she is claiming that the hypothesis must be true if communication happens. To support this contention Hornsby draws a Gricean distinction between natural and non-natural meaning. The distinction is illustrated in the following way. The 96 tree rings mean that the tree is 96 years old. If it turns out that the tree is not 96 years old, then the 96 tree rings do not mean that the tree is 96 years old. This is natural meaning. The three rings of the bell on the bus mean that the bus is full. But if it turns out that the bus is not full, the three rings on the bell still meant that the bus is full. This is non-natural meaning. Grice proposed that the sense in which a linguistic expression means something is to be modelled on the latter as opposed to the former. The sentence ―Putting financial power into the hands of learners makes student choice meaningful‖ is meaningful even if putting financial power into the hands of learners does not make student choice meaningful. Hornsby claims that we cannot rely on natural meaning when communicating with linguistic expressions. So, we must rely instead on the nonnatural meaning of sentences as understood by interlocutors prior to the exchange.212 That is her justification for adopting Stenius' attitude. But, supposing that we do have to rely upon non-natural meaning rather than natural meaning in linguistic communication, for that to entail adoption of Stenius' attitude, it needs to be further supposed that the only viable way to recognise non-natural meaning is by becoming aware of a regularity between non-natural meanings and linguistic expressions. Hornsby supports this assumption by the following consideration. When the natural meaning of an item present in the conversational circumstances cannot be used to get someone to recognise what one wants them to think (communication consisting in getting someone to think something) communication becomes difficult. But, communication with linguistic expressions is not difficult. Hence something must take up the slack. This something is shared knowledge of the non-natural meaning of the linguistic expressions. Unfortunately, no argument is given for thinking that this is the only option.213 So Hornsby's discussion gets us no further than the assumption that recognising the truth-conditions of sentences is not something that can be easily done unless there is a regularity in the use of 212 (Hornsby 2009, p.116) 213 Hornsby's discussion is intended only ―to make it plausible that shared knowledge of meaning is necessary for linguistic communication as we know it‖ (ibid, p.114, emphasis added). 156 those sentences and their truth-conditions which has been learnt in advance of the communicative exchange. In a yet more recent literature Stenius' attitude can be found again. This skirmish concerns the degree to which sentences' truth-conditions change from instance to instance. Jason Stanley sides against those who claim there is a great degree of context-sensitivity because (he thinks) the possibility of communication is threatened. He calls a rejection of the hypothesis, ―the pessimistic view‖: On this view, there are ever so many reasons why utterances have the intuitive truth-conditions they do, and nothing of great import to say about what unifies these disparate explanations...On the pessimistic view, there is stability to word meaning and the significance of the syntactic structure of sentences. But in general there is no systematic way of going from the meanings of the words in a sentence and its syntactic structure to the intuitive truth-conditions of its various utterances. (Stanley 2007, p.8) About the pessimistic view he says this: If any version of the pessimistic view were correct, significant facts about linguistic communication would be inexplicable. From an utterance of a sentence, one gains information about the world. If Hannah utters to Esther the English sentence ―There is some chocolate in the kitchen‖, and if Esther wants chocolate, she will go to the kitchen...If there is no systematic way of proceeding from knowledge of the extra-linguistic context and knowledge of the meaning of the individual words and modes of combination into sentences to a grasp of the information about the world that is conveyed by an utterance of a sentence, it is mysterious how language-users could so smoothly move from linguistic comprehension to action. In short, if the pessimistic view were correct, the connection between speech and action would be inexplicable. (Stanley 2007, pp.8-9) Given that the pessimistic view is one according to which there is nothing general to say about the truth-conditions of instances of sentences, and given that ―systematic way of proceeding...‖ etc. is supposed to be a gloss on what the pessimistic view denies, Stanley is here expressing Stenius' attitude. He is claiming that it would be ―mysterious‖ how communication is effected if there were 157 no long regularity between some ―information about the world‖ and a sentence. It is the talk of an association between ―information about the world‖ and a sentence which lets slide that Stanley's concern here is with substantial truth-conditions. In the same literature Cappelen and Lepore present an argument against the position they call ―radical contextualism.‖214 Even though it is not quite Stenius attitude, because they may be thought to be prime upholders of that attitude I will nonetheless describe this argument. According to the radical contextualist, there are n factors over and above the linguistic expressions employed which are determinants of the truth-conditions of sentences. Unfortunately, many of these factors are not available to a hearer in a communicative exchange. Hence, if the radical contextualist were correct then the hearer should not be able to ascertain the truth-conditions of the sentences produced. But she can. So the radical contextualist is not correct. The target here is not a rejection of the hypothesis but instead of an acceptance of a particular version of the hypothesis, viz. a psychological further factor view with a commitment to the hypothesis. In constructing their Frankenstein category, ―radical contextualism,‖ Cappelen and Lepore classify OS alongside such a view. As was argued in Chapter I, these views are not even consistent and should not be placed under the same banner. Nonetheless, the concern raised is that the further factors posited are not recognisable by the hearer. It is because of that that the view is thought incompatible with the possibility of communication. In this respect, it is similar to the concern raised by the other doubters: what is available to the hearer when a speaker speaks underdetermines what the extensions are of the speakers' words. I have little doubt that if they became aware of the difference 214 (Cappelen and Lepore 2005, chapter 8). They offer several other arguments against ―radical contextualism.‖ One can be found in (Cappelen and Lepore 2006) and (Lepore 2010). The argument is that in one circumstance of speaking someone can use a sentence with given truth-conditions, and then in another circumstance someone can use the same sentence with the same truth-conditions. Surely that is true. They think this should not be possible given the truth of certain theories because of the differences in the circumstances. According to Cappelen and Lepore, differences in circumstances force the sentence to have different truth-conditions in each case. I struggle to see how Cappelen and Lepore came to take this worry seriously. There would be the forced shift of truth-conditions only if there was not more than one kind of circumstance that would make a sentence have given truthconditions. If many different circumstances would lead to the same sentence having the same truth-conditions, then there is simply no reason to think that differences in circumstances force shifts in truth-conditions. But then there is no problem of so-called ―shared content‖ on the grounds Cappelen and Lepore provide. 158 between OS and the other views they classify as ―radical contextualist‖ they would maintain Stenius' attitude. But that is not what Cappelen and Lepore have done in print. 4 The incompatibility argument In our sample there is a recurring theme. It is being supposed that what takes place in a communicative exchange would not be a suitable basis upon which to identify the truth-conditions of a sentence if there were no regularity in the truthconditions of the sentence across productions which could be learnt by fellow interlocutors in advance of an exchange in which the sentence is used to communicate. None of the doubters go into much detail about just why the absence of such a regularity would make the truth-conditions of a sentence unrecognisable to fellow interlocutors. However, both Lewis and Hornsby focus on the conventional nature of the truth-conditions of a sentence: that there is nothing about a sentence which endows it with the truth-conditions it has other than that speakers treat it that way. I will now present an argument by which the doubters are guided. Its key premise will be supported by appeal to the conventional nature of truth-conditions (etc.) of sentences (etc.). To help us state the argument I will introduce two terms. The activity of speaking is for present purposes the production of a sentence. We are interested however in the role of speaking in communication. Given what communication involves, if A produces a sentence by means of which she communicates with B, A's uttered sentence must have conditions of truth. This is often spoken of as the making of an assertion or a statement or a claim or as expressing a proposition. I mean to speak of nothing more than what is involved in the production of a sentence with such and such truth-conditions to engage in communication. Let us say that for a speaker to produce a sentence in this sense is for there to be a speaking episode. This is our first term. Hornsby laid emphasis on a distinction between natural and non-natural meaning, placing the meaning of linguistic expressions into the latter category. Without deploying Grice's distinction, for the purposes of the forthcoming argument, this point should be acknowledged. I will put the point like so: the sentence produced in the speaking episode has some of its properties non-essentially. A property is nonessential if the object can lack that property and still be what it is. Included within 159 a linguistic expression's non-essential properties is its extension: a sentence's condition of truth, a predicate's satisfiers, a referring expression's referent(s).215 If a sentence's truth-conditions are a non-essential feature of a sentence then a sentence in itself is not a basis upon which to identify its truth-conditions. At least when one does not speak a language, one cannot determine the truth-conditions of a sentence (or indeed, the referent of a name or the satisfiers of a predicate) by examining the sentence. To try to identify the truth-conditions of a sentence would be like trying to ascertain whether the coffee cup is to the left of the tea mug by inspecting only the coffee cup. Though being to the left of the tea mug may be a property of the coffee cup, the condition of the coffee cup within its spatial boundaries is not what makes the coffee cup have this property. So far as that is concerned, it is left quite open whether the coffee cup has this property. Inspecting a sentence in a similarly blinkered way will not yield its truth-conditions. There is nothing about a sentence qua form of sound or mark that makes it have the truthconditions it does. The other term I want to introduce is classificatory disposition. A speaker's classificatory disposition is her tendency to count given items as the referents of referring expressions, given items as the satisfiers of predicates, and given conditions as the conditions of truth and falsity of sentences. This is what one would try to describe if one was in the business of producing models for a formal semantics which document the substantial truth-conditions of sentences. In supposing there is such a thing I make no commitment about the regularity's longevity. Nor do I intend to adopt any particular theory of meaning. Our interest in a classificatory disposition lies in how we glossed communication earlier. To communicate there has to be such a thing as what a speaker would count as making her sentence (one produced in a given exchange) true. Otherwise you have the following problem. Suppose she comes to know that such and such is so and she wants to communicate that this is so by producing a sentence with such and such truth-conditions. If she does not know what the truth-conditions are of the sentence then she would not know what sentence to produce to do this. So a speaker has to know what would make true a sentence she produces if communication is to be possible. She needs to know this so she can claim to be so what she knows to be 215 See (Austin 1950, pp.118-119), (de Saussure 1916 [1983], p.67), and (Locke 1689 [1975], p.405). 160 so.216 That there exist some such dispositions cannot be altogether controversial given that many think that such things can be documented or employed to arbitrate arguments by students of language about how language works (to speak broadly). I want now to expand what is to be included in a speaking episode. The expansion is called for because there are more items in it to which a classificatory disposition is typically thought sensitive than the sentence produced therein. There are three further elements to be considered though only two will be admitted into the speaking episode and only one of those will be relevant to the truth-conditions of a sentence. The first addition is force.217 A given sentence can have truth-conditions but vary along the following dimension: it can be a suggestion, an assertion, a question, a command, and so on. The standard view is that this sort of variation does not interfere with the truth-conditions of the sentence employed: content and force are mutually autonomous. Because such a feature is independent of the truthconditions (etc.) of a sentence (etc.) we can ignore it in what follows. The second addition is (the further factor conception of) context. Across different productions of a given sentence, used to speak of the same item, and with no change in the item spoken of, there can be changes in whether the sentence is classified by competent users as true. A further factor view introduces factors beyond the words and syntax of a linguistic expression as factors relevant to the truth-conditions of sentences. We have seen all this before in Chapter I. What, in addition, is worth noting is that the contextual factors stand to the sentence as do its truth-conditions: they are relevant to the truth-value of the sentence only because speakers are disposed to modulate (in a sense totally unrelated to Recanati's use of the term) the truthvalue of a sentence relative to various features of the circumstance. That I count 216 Travis' (1989, p.32) view allows that words as produced by an individual on a given occasion, can change in their truth-conditions, satisfiers, and extension across different occasions for evaluating those words. My talk here of a speaker's classificatory disposition might seem incompatible with that because it seems to give only the speaker the capacity to determine these features of her words. However, firstly, this is so only if she is skilled. What her words do is not a matter merely of what she intends to do. Secondly, in the case of communication, the requirement that the speaker be aware of how her words are to be operated is important in a way which undermines the kind of example Travis uses to illustrate his evaluation sensitivity. For in those cases we have to ignore what the speaker may have been trying to say with her words altogether. But that is precisely what one ought not to do if communication is taking place. 217 Cf. (Green 2007) for an overview. 161 the sentence ―I am standing‖ true at one moment and then false at the next is as little an inherent feature of it as a truth-condition minus such relativisation. Henceforth when I speak of a classificatory disposition I mean to include in this disposition the relativisations that are typical of further factor views of contextsensitivity. The third and final addition is ―speaker's intention.‖ Grice (1957) floated an idea that has caught on. He proposed that sentences mean things because speakers intend things by them. What do they intend? The intention in question is: to intend that someone form a belief that p by recognising that one intends them to believe that p. A sentence is produced to make this intention recognisable. The truthconditions of the sentence are the truth-conditions of the belief that p. It is because there is regularity in the use of sentences as having such and such truth-conditions that one's intention can be made plain to another. Hence, such a view is a version of the hypothesis and, surprise surprise, it is offered to explain how communication is possible. So it is not consistent with rejection of the hypothesis. For this reason, it is not to be supposed in the current discussion. One could maintain that a sentence has the truth-conditions of a belief that a speaker intends someone to form by recognising that the speaker has this intention by way of recognising the sentence produced but drop any commitment to the hypothesis: there is no regularity in what is intended by uttering certain sentences. However, it would then become puzzling why the sentence (given the nonessentiality of its truth-conditions) would make the intention recognisable. So why would someone utter a sentence to make recognisable their Gricean intention? We could drop the commitment that the recipient of the sentence is supposed to determine the intention by means of the sentence produced. The resulting view would be that an instance of a sentence has the truth-conditions of the belief that the speaker intends the recipient to form by means of recognising that the speaker has this intention. This I think we could accept as part of the speaking episode without prejudging whether the hypothesis is true. But I do not think it is true: a speaker can produce a sentence which has truth-conditions other than what she intended. For instance, suppose I try to inform Ralph Cotter of something but I mistake two names for one another. I utter the sentence, ―Robert Syverten did the deed‖ but I intend Cotter to form the belief that Henry Chinaski did the deed by recognising my intention that he do so. I think Henry Chinaski is Robert Syverten. 162 Suppose Cotter finds out about this and he has me in the grip of a vice. He accuses me of telling him something false. He says, ―You told me that Syverten did the deed. But it was Chinaski.‖ All I can say is that I intended to say that Chinaski did it. I got their names confused. I cannot truly say that I did not say what Cotter thinks I said.218 In such a case what I intended and what I did diverge. Thus, the truth-conditions of the relevant belief can come apart from the truth-conditions of the sentence as then uttered. Hence, what a speaker intends to say does not determine what they say. As with any action, they have to speak competently if what they intend and what happens is to coincide. Furthermore, for this reason a speaker's intention should not be identified with a classificatory disposition. In the cases envisaged, the speaker classifies the expressions produced in ways that diverge from what was intended. Hence his classificatory disposition diverges from what he intends. We could add to the speaking episode that the speaker is attempting to communicate something. If we are speaking of a speaker in a speaking episode who is attempting to communicate, then sure enough, there is a speaker present who is attempting to communicate. That seems innocuous enough. 4.1 The argument With these terms (―speaking episode‖ and ―classificatory disposition‖) we can walk through an argument for Stenius' attitude: The Incompatibility Argument (TIA) 1) A and B can communicate only if the speaking episode does not underdetermine the classificatory disposition of the speaker. (assumption) Recall that a speaking episode includes: a sentence produced; some further factors; and the force of the utterance. There are (long, transient or whatever) regularities between sentences, further factors, and the substantial truth-conditions of the sentences. Such a regularity in a speaker's behaviour is a classificatory disposition of that speaker. The relata of this relation which are not truth-conditions of sentences form the elements of the speaking episode. If sentences have their truth- 218 The example can be reworked for the switches in extension of predicates across different uses. There is nothing special about the fact that names were confused here. The simple fact is that, as with all action, what one does and what one intends need not coincide. 163 conditions non-essentially then, for all that takes place in their production, nothing requires that a speaker have one classificatory disposition over any other toward the sentence produced. This is in two respects. First, there is nothing materially about expressions which requires one truth-condition rather than another. We have recognised this in registering that the truth-conditions of a sentence are nonessential features of it. Second, given that a speaker aims only to communicate, and given what communication is as we have glossed it, there is no reason a speaker has to use a sentence with one truth-condition rather than any other. Hence, as well as there being no material constraint provided by the speaking episode on the truth-conditions assigned sentences by the speaker, there is also no reason that a rational speaker would use a sentence with a given truth-condition if there is no long regularity in the substantial truth-conditions of sentences. An apparent exception is this. If her interlocutor uses sentences with certain truthconditions then, if she aims to communicate with this interlocutor, she would do well to use the same sentences with the same truth-conditions her interlocutor uses them with: she has reason to do so. However, if we really are rejecting the hypothesis then we should suppose that there is no regularity in how her interlocutor uses sentences either. But then the problem facing her is also facing her interlocutor.219 So the true state of affairs, given an absence of a (long) regularity in the substantial truth-conditions of sentences, is that she cannot rely on how the other interlocutor is using her sentences because there is no general way her interlocutor is using the sentences. Grant all this. Then as far as what happens within the speaking episode is concerned, the speaker could possess any of many classificatory dispositions toward the sentence produced. We can paraphrase this by saying that if the hypothesis is false then the speaking episode underdetermines the classificatory disposition of the speaker. This is our reductio premise: 2) The speaking episode underdetermines the classificatory disposition of the speaker. (assumption) From these two premises we can easily derive a devastating conclusion: 219 This is the basis upon which (Lewis 1969) builds his account of language use as conventional. 164 3) It is not the case that A and B can communicate (modus tollens, (1) and (2)). Because rejection of the hypothesis commits us to (2), rejection of the hypothesis appears to commit us to the impossibility of communication. For us to reject assumption (1), we would need to show that communication is possible even though what is available to an interlocutor in a speaking episode underdetermines the classificatory disposition of the speaker towards her expressions and hence the substantial extensions of the sentence produced. But communication, as we are understanding it, just is for a hearer to ascertain the truth-conditions of a sentence produced in a speaking episode and that cannot be done if there is underdetermination of the speaker's classificatory disposition by the speaking episode. One may feel uneasy about premise (1) because of the supposed connection between the extensions of expressions and the classificatory disposition of the speaker. This for two reasons: firstly, because it may lead to Humpty-Dumpty tendencies; secondly, because it may not leave room for a difference between speaking correctly and speaking simpliciter. As against the first concern note the following. Firstly, as was explained earlier, what the speaker may intend and her classificatory disposition need not coincide. On the current view one cannot, without skill, make words have extensions just by intending them to do so. Secondly, although the words employed do not establish an extension or relativised extension, it is not being denied that one cannot use ―girl‖ to speak of crustaceans, for instance, and still speak English (properly). The second concern requires there to be a way to use words incorrectly. But we have two: firstly, the words can be misused if one violates whatever constraints they provide on their usage; secondly, that the speaker can fail to do what she aims to do introduces a difference between what she does and what it would be rational for her to do and hence introduces a difference between correctly using a word and how she actually uses such. The close association of classificatory disposition and extensions of produced expressions that is supposed in premise (1) does not in itself warrant the relevant unease. What about premise (2)? The warrant for this assumption is that there is nothing about sentences which makes them have the truth-conditions they do. They have them because of how speakers treat them. But if there is no regularity in how 165 speakers treat them then across the time for which there is no such regularity, there is nothing about the speaking episode(s) which places any constraint on with what classificatory disposition a speaker operates a given sentence. So for all that takes place in the speaking episode, any of many different classificatory dispositions could be had toward the sentence produced therein. Our doubters each suppose that someone would not be able to tell what the truthconditions were of a sentence if there were no regularity of the pertinent sort. So, albeit with a little sharpening, each doubter supposes that premise (2) follows from the hypothesis' falsity. Thus, by way of TIA, we can see why the doubters would think the possibility of communication is not consistent with the hypothesis' falsity. If the hypothesis is false then the speaking episode underdetermines the classificatory disposition of the speaker because it provides neither material nor rational constraints sufficient to constrain the classificatory disposition to uniqueness. But if that is so, then a hearer cannot discern what the classificatory disposition the speaker has towards the sentence she utters. But then the hearer cannot know what to expect if that sentence is true given what she has to go on from the speaking episode. Communication is in peril. 166 C H A P T E R V I Two failed inflations of the speaking episode and one with potential 1 Introduction The plausibility of premise (2) of TIA depends upon our assumptions about the speaking episode: what is in it and what constraints it places upon the classificatory disposition of the speaker. One way to criticise the premise is to question the accuracy of the gloss of the speaking episode we used to defend it. For this reason we will investigate whether we have omitted important elements of the speaking episode which would make a difference to what classificatory disposition a speaker could have in operating the sentence. Are there elements of the speaking episode which, were they included in our gloss of it, would give the speaker reason to use the expressions she does in one way rather than another? In this chapter we will discuss three proposals about what might be missing. The first proposal can be found in Austin's work on speech acts. The only notion of force that we considered in the previous chapter was one that had nothing to do with truth-conditions (and more generally, extensions). Austin's conception of force is not of this sort. Does Austin's conception of force make a difference to premise (2)? We find the second proposal in McDowell's critique of a Dummettian argument for semantic antirealism. McDowell attacks Dummett's gloss on speech behaviour. This attack could be deployed against our gloss on the speaking episode. However, both Austin and McDowell's proposals will be found to be inadequate for dislodging premise (2). It is a second proposal we find in McDowell's work that proves much more promising and will be developed into an objection to the premise in the next chapter. 167 2 Austin's speech acts As everybody who has heard of him knows, Austin distinguishes between various aspects of speaking, some of which extend beyond the production of linguistic expressions. One aspect he calls a ―locutionary act.‖ It is introduced as follows: ...the utterance of certain words in a certain construction, and the utterance of them with a certain  meaning' in the favourite philosophical sense of that word, i.e. with a certain sense and with a certain reference. (Austin 1975, p.94) Austin calls a second aspect of speaking the ―illocutionary act‖ which he introduces by example thus: When we perform a locutionary act, we use speech: but in what way precisely are we using it on this occasion? For there are very numerous functions of or ways in which we use speech, and it makes a great difference to our act in some sense...in which way and which sense we were on this occasion  using' it. It makes a great deal of difference whether we were advising, or merely suggesting, or actually ordering, whether we were strictly promising or only announcing a vague intention, and so forth. (Austin 1975, p.99) To perform an illocutionary act is at least to have performed a locutionary act. But not vice versa. At what point (the locutionary act, the illocutionary act, or something else?) has one produced something that has substantial truthconditions? Some philosophers suppose that Austin intended this point to be the locutionary act. The illocutionary act is then an add-on that does not affect the truth-conditions of the sentence produced. Variation in the illocutionary aspect of a speech act is variation in whether the words are a question, a command, a supposition, a statement, and various other things. But this variation is not variation in truth-conditions. This is what we referred to as ―force‖ in the previous chapter. For instance, Searle depicts the determination of truth-conditions as an entirely separate matter from the determination of illocution.220 He is one example. 220 (Searle 1968, p.420) 168 Notice however that no other possibility is considered on the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy entry on speech acts.221 This view is a dominant view. Austin's locutionary-illocutionary distinction is not to be identified with the distinction between something sufficient for there to be truth-conditions of the sentence produced and a mood-like illocutionary force.222 Such a view is inconsistent with Austin's own remarks on the distinction. He is entirely explicit that truth-conditions, on his view, are not determined once there are in place meaningful words in proper syntactic combination. One statement to this effect is from his article  Truth': ...―proposition‖ is sometimes used in a special way for ―the meaning or sense of a sentence or family of sentences‖: but whether we think a lot or little of this usage, a proposition in this sense cannot, at any rate, be what we say is true or false. (Austin 1950, p.113) I do not see how this can be read in any way other than as saying that so far as the meaning or sense of a sentence goes, various different things that are true or false could be in place. The same point is repeated in How to Do Things with Words: 221 (Green 2007) 222 (Searle 1968, p.420) explicitly doubts his own reading of Austin. Furthermore, Searle's own reason for adopting his favoured distinction is poor. He proposes that there are sentences (e.g. ―I hereby promise that I will do it‖) which determine an illocutionary force so that there is no difference between performing a locutionary act and performing an illocutionary act with such sentences. In response to this one can readily say: but of course you can fail to perform an illocutionary act without failing to perform a locutionary act. Searle replies to such a response by saying that to appeal to such considerations in drawing a locutionary/illocutionary distinction one would reduce the distinction to one between trying to perform an illocutionary act and failing, and trying to perform an illocutionary act and succeeding. In response to this one can say two things. Firstly, so what? More is required for one to do an illocutionary act than a locutionary one. That is still of interest. Second, Searle's example here is not convincing. One could ask a question, for instance, with ―I hereby promise that I will do it.‖ In response to this second response Searle will add to his initial proposal that there are no locutionary acts that are not illocutionary acts (Searle 1968, p.412). In defence of this claim he directs us to Austin's description of a locutionary act as a rhetic act and in giving examples of rhetic acts uses indirect quotation where he at other points uses indirect quotation to contrast illocutionary and locutionary acts (Searle 1968, pp.410-411). But this is beside the point. A rhetic act / locutionary act is to produce words with given meanings whereas to do an illocutionary act is do something more than that. Austin may have been less than careful (in his notes) when offering illustrations of the contrasts but this should not lead us to ignore the more explicit explanations that he offers of those same contrasts; namely, that things can go awry for an illocutionary act while leaving the locutionary act intact. 169 The truth or falsity of a statement depends not merely on the meanings of words but on what act you were performing in what circumstances. (Austin 1975, p.145) Although it does not greatly matter (because the mention of circumstances already makes the point), it is nonetheless clear that the ―act you were performing‖ is not to be identified with a locutionary act. That was defined by Austin as the production of meaningful words.223 So what distinguishes two locutionary acts is the meaningful words produced. But read so as to say that we would have to make the mention of what act you were performing in this passage to be redundant. Assuming that it is not redundant, it is more reasonable to take him to speak of an illocutionary act. But nor is it correct to read ―what act you were performing‖ as having a contrast class of statements versus questions versus commands etc. The contrast class is between different statements or statings. This is clear from the fact that in the passage Austin is talking solely about the ―truth or falsity of a statement‖ and not of the truth or falsity of something made in the performance of some variety (statement, or question, or command, or supposition or etc.) of illocutionary act. What perhaps makes it tempting to read Austin in the way Searle, for instance, does, is that Austin identifies the meaning of a sentence with what he calls their ―sense‖ and ―reference‖, and those terms are commonly understood in analytic philosophy as concerned with truth and truth-conditions. However, notice that he explicitly uses the word ―sense‖ in the quotation from  Truth' to speak of something that does not determine truth-conditions. The fact that Austin uses those words should not override what he is rather explicit about. Our interest in what Austin has to say about speaking episodes is not in the differences between statements and, say, questions. Our interest is in what more he says needs to be in place in order for someone to have produced a sentence with given truth-conditions (which Austin thinks includes things that can be called ―statements‖), over and above the production of meaningful words in proper syntactic combination. 223 (Austin 1975, p.94) 170 2.1 Austin's method and observations Austin describes his method for studying the production of linguistic expressions as follows: Besides the uttering of the words of the so-called performative, a good many other things have as a general rule to be right and to go right if we are to be said to have happily brought off our action. What these are we may hope to discover by looking at and classifying types of case in which something goes wrong and the act of-marrying, betting, bequeathing, christening, or what not-is therefore at least to some extent a failure: the utterance is then, we may say, not indeed false but in general unhappy. (Austin 1975, p.14) ...typically we distinguish different abstracted  acts' by means of the possible slips between cup and lip, that is, in this case, the different types of nonsense which may be engendered in performing them. (Austin 1975, p.146) He engages in a reverse engineering of the things we do when speaking: he is faced with a mechanism whose boundaries and components he is unsure of. So he disables elements of the scene in which the speaking episode takes place and he watches to see what effect this has, if any, on the episode itself. Let us review some of Austin's results collected with this method.224 Firstly, statements can be made when one does not believe them. However, this is for a statement to be inadequate in some sense. Austin takes this to mean that a statement, for it to be happy, must have a truth-condition that the speaker takes to obtain. Secondly, a statement commits one to ―saying or stating‖ other statements. Presumably this does not mean that one must actually make the other statements. That is obviously false. Presumably Austin means that commitment to some statements commits one to the truth of others (his example: ―The cat is on the mat‖ and ―the mat is under the cat‖). So once again, presumably, if one commits oneself to the negation of some such other statement then there is something unhappy about one's statement. Thirdly, there are statements that include terms which purport to refer but do not. For the statement to have gone well, what is purportedly referred to must exist. Fourthly, one can make a statement in which 224 (Austin 1975, pp.136-144) 171 one is not in a position to know what one states to be so. Austin puts this by saying that one can only be ―guessing or conjecturing,‖ as if this were not compatible with stating. So presumably, he has in mind a notion of statement such that to have made a statement entails that one was in a position to state how things are. The boundaries of a speaker's awareness appear to constrain what she can be doing in uttering certain words. Someone cannot be indicating how things are somewhere if there is no way they could be aware of how things are there. A second respect, that Austin indicates, in which the speaker's awareness is relevant to what she can be doing in uttering words is to what one could have been referring. If one is totally unaware of purple swans on Mars, and one makes a claim that no swan is purple, then if someone were to later discover Martian swans, one could respond by saying that one was not talking about those, and that might well be an acceptable defence of the truth of one's statement in spite of the presence of the Martian swans. Fifthly, one can misspeak. One can say something one did not mean to. The only variety of misspeaking that Austin considers is selection of the wrong word (―cat‖ rather than ―bat‖). This suggests that when producing words, it is not the case that things went well as regards the words one uttered just so long as one produced some statement or other when one uttered one's words. Sixthly, there is a need, claims Austin, to secure ―uptake.‖ This is worth a comment. Some have taken the requirement of uptake to be a condition that must be met for there to have been an illocutionary act whatsoever.225 What Austin actually says is this: Unless a certain effect is achieved, the illocutionary act will not have been happily, successfully performed. This is not to say that the illocutionary act is the achieving of a certain effect. I cannot be said to have warned an audience unless it hears what I say and takes what I say in a certain sense. An effect must be achieved on the audience if the illocutionary act is to be carried out. How should we best put it here? And how can we limit it? Generally the effect amounts to bringing about the understanding of the meaning and of the force of the locution. So the performance of an illocutionary act involves the securing of uptake. (Austin 1975, pp.116-117) True, Austin does say, ―An effect must be achieved on the audience if the illocutionary act is to be carried out.‖ But he also speaks of what is required for an 225 E.g. (Langton 1993), who has come in for some criticism because she has adopted this view. 172 act to be successfully or happily carried out and that leaves room for reading him as allowing that something more than a locutionary act took place (perhaps an unsuccessful warning, or a badly done warning, or an inept warning) despite the failure of uptake. There is no need to attribute an all-or-nothing view to Austin on this matter. Uptake is required for happiness but not necessarily for existence. Seventh, a statement can be evaluated for correctness in ways other than its truth or falsity. We can ask whether it is accurate or an exaggeration, for instance. These are further ways of being unhappy. Finally, and perhaps most promisingly, the truth-conditions of a sentence depend upon the intents and purposes of the speaker who utters it; they can change with changes in these. 2.2 Conventions and after-effects A problem with most of these observations for our purposes is that they concern the happiness of a statement and not its truth-conditions. So even if we expanded the speaking episode to include them, they would not (at least not automatically) constrain the classificatory disposition of the speaker. The exception is the relation between truth-conditions and intent and purpose. However, the objection I want to make encompasses even that relation. Austin restricts to two categories that more which can be done in or by uttering words. These categories coincide with his illocutionary and perlocutionary distinction. We will get to the perlocutionary in a moment. First note that what more takes place in an illocutionary act over and above the production of expressions is in a sense, conventional.226 There is room for discussion in how the word ―conventional‖ is to be understood in Austin. Let us distinguish two ways it could be understood. Firstly, one might mean to say that something is so in virtue of a ―construction put on it by judges.‖227 Whether a wall is a goal depends upon whether certain judges classify it as such in (and for) their game of football. Judging it to be so makes it so. This contrasts with (to jump ahead just a little) what effects are brought about by producing certain sounds (e.g. that a crying baby on the train quietens). By judging that it is so, I cannot thereby make it so. It is something beyond the powers of stipulation. Secondly, one might mean something more like Lewis' proposal, which adds to the first idea a presumption of longevity 226 Cf. (Austin 1975, p.103, p.107, pp.115-116) 227 (Austin 1975, p.116 fn1) 173 across different occasions.228 That a given wall is a goal for a given game of football does not entail that it ever be or have been used as such another time. But it would still for all that, and in our first sense, be conventional. I cannot discern anything in Austin's words that suggests the stronger commitment. But there are remarks (like the footnote quoted a few sentences ago) which indicate that the first idea is in play: such and such things are the way they are because they are treated as being that way. So that more which takes place when one utters words and one performs an illocutionary act is sufficient for one to have performed the illocutionary act because that utterance of words so counted by convention in the first, weaker, sense. That is one category of that more which takes place when someone speaks that Austin notes. In addition there is the perlocutionary act. Austin introduces it like so: Saying something will often, or even normally, produce certain consequential effects upon the feelings, thoughts, or actions of the audience, or of the speaker, or of other persons: and it may be done with the design, intention, or purpose of producing them...We shall call the performance of an act of this kind the performance of a  perlocutionary' act... (Austin 1975, p.101) ...the perlocutionary act which is the achieving of certain effects by saying something. (Austin 1975, p.120) For instance, one might utter the words, ―I think his ego would take a real smashing‖ and thereby persuade him to keep quiet about his success. So by uttering the words I achieve some effect on him. This is to be contrasted with an illocutionary act in that that more which takes place is a non-conventional consequence of a locutionary and illocutionary act: that the effect followed is not made so by convention. So there are two categories into which Austin divides that more which can be done when someone utters words: there are, in the first weaker sense, conventional addons to uttering words and there are after-effects of uttering words. The question is now whether speaking episodes thus embellished place any constraints on what 228 (Lewis 1969) 174 classificatory disposition a speaker could have toward a sentence he produces in a speaking episode. Take the illocutionary aspect of a speech act. This (including the relation of intents and purposes to an uttered sentence's truth-conditions) is conventional in the sense that what one did in uttering certain words is so because classified as such by (competent) speakers. But then whatever more is added in this way to the speaking episode, there is no reason to expect some element to bear upon the truthconditions of the sentence uttered in one way rather than another, other than how interlocutors treat it as so bearing. But if there is no regularity in that that could be learned in advance (as per rejection of the hypothesis), then the considerations in favour of premise (2) of TIA apply equally to the relation between a speaking episode thus expanded and the classificatory disposition of the speaker. So admitting an Austinian illocution into the speaking episode cannot help us dispose of premise (2). What about perlocutionary acts? Suppose a speaker aims to bring about a given effect-to perform a given perlocutionary act. Let us set aside certain effects one could achieve by producing an expression. For instance, deafening someone, or annoying someone by producing sounds when they are trying to concentrate on something else. In achieving these effects the truth-conditions of the sentence produced are idle. Let us focus on those effects achieved by means of the recognised truth-conditions of the sentence produced, that is, by means of the performance of an illocutionary act. Of the relation between the illocutionary and the perlocutionary, Austin says this: ...we may entirely clear up whether someone was arguing [an illocutionary act] or not without touching on the question whether he was convincing anyone [a perlocutionary act] or not. (Austin 1975, p.103) But then the only addition to the speaking episode contributed by the perlocutionary aspect depends upon there being, already in place, truth-conditions of the sentence and hence a classificatory disposition with which the sentence has been wielded. As Austin's remark indicates, this is something which is in place whether or not the relevant after-effect is achieved. Hence, there is nothing about the perlocutionary aspect of a speech act which constrains the classificatory disposition which the speaker has toward the sentence produced. So as with the 175 illocutionary aspect, the perlocutionary aspect is also of no help in disposing of premise (2). Although Austin helps us recognise that more takes place in speaking than might at first be acknowledged, because he analysed this into the conventional and the after-effect, his observations (thus presented, at least) are of no help to us. 3 McDowell on Dummett on speech behaviour McDowell attacks Dummett's construal of linguistic behaviour. Dummett claims that a speaker cannot exhibit, in her linguistic behaviour, knowledge of the truthconditions of a sentence if that sentence is undecidable.229 But because such sentences are nonetheless meaningful, and because meaning must be fully manifestable in linguistic behaviour, their meaning cannot be identified with truthconditions.230 McDowell concedes that this is so if one means by ―linguistic behaviour‖ the assenting and dissenting to claims of the truth of a sentence in observable circumstances. But he denies that one need restrict ―linguistic behaviour‖ to this.231 In its place he proposes that linguistic behaviour can include asserting that something is so. Might we adopt this suggestion for our purposes? The proposal would be to locate within the speaking episode something (an assertion) which ensures that the sentence uttered in the speaking episode has a determinate truth-condition. When we learn a language we learn to recognise someone asserting something with such and such truth-conditions. We can do this without relying on a regularity between sentences, circumstance, force, and truthconditions which we have learnt in advance of a given communicative episode. Hence, premise (2) of TIA does not follow from rejection of the hypothesis. Doubt can be cast upon this proposal rather easily. It is far from clear that we really have something (namely assertion) that is different from a production of a sentence (in context, with force) with a given classificatory disposition. What is to stop us from identifying an assertion with no more than this? 229 (McDowell 1981 [1998]). There are difficulties in specifying what ―decidable‖ is supposed to mean for a non-mathematical statement for which mathematical proofs are not available. We will suppose that a sentence is decidable if and only if it is possible to ascertain whether it is true or false. 230 This was an argument we considered in Chapter IV. 231 (McDowell 1981 [1998], p.317) 176 One response to this question is to counter it with another question: does one need to say anything more? After all, no one is asking for us to say something more about, for instance, producing a sentence. If they did we may well run into difficulties in saying anything generally true of episodes of producing a sentence. So why suppose that more need be said about assertion? The reason is this. If we cannot comfortably distinguish the two then we have reason to doubt that an assertion is anything more than what we originally took a speaking episode to be. If a speaking episode is nothing more than the producing of a sentence toward which the speaker has a given classificatory disposition then there is the same question as we had before as to how the speaking episode constrains the classificatory disposition of the speaker toward the sentence produced in the episode. One might stubbornly persist with the counter-question. If one has that temptation then note the following. Generally it is true of explanation that when someone requests it that request can be responded to with a dismissal of the question as daft. It may be laughed at, ridiculed, ignored. But the better teacher does not stop at that. She will be able to explain what is wrong with the question. When we request an explanation of the difference between a speaking episode, as we have glossed it, and an asserting, we may well be told not to ask the question, but we have yet to find an explanation for why that is. Insofar as this request is not responded to, those who find it difficult to distinguish the two will continue to find it so. The obvious next step is to examine what more McDowell has to say about assertion. But with two exceptions, to which we will turn later, McDowell says nothing to distinguish assertion, whatever it is, from what is covered by our gloss of what happens in a speaking episode. What he offers instead, which still might be useful, are considerations against the possibility and necessity of a description of the speaking episode along the lines Dummett would prefer.232 Perhaps these considerations apply to our own description of the speaking episode? Let us examine each criticism and how it might apply to our own discussion. First, there is a charge against the possibility of a Dummettian view of linguistic behaviour. Dummett seeks to provide a description of a speaker's use of a sentence 232 (McDowell 1981 [1998], p.321) 177 in terms that do not include appeal to anything that requires in place already an understanding of the speaker's use of the sentence; he seeks a reductively specified behavioural correlate of a speaker's production of a sentence with truth-conditions. McDowell calls the desired perspective one of the ―cosmic exile.‖233 Dummett thinks behaviour to which, from this perspective, one can appeal, will be no more than the assenting and dissenting behaviour of the speaker toward the sentence in various different conditions. McDowell argues against the possibility of constructing such a theory. He denies that a theorist could recognise a non-linguistic behavioural correlate of a speaker's capacity to recognise and produce sentences with given truth-conditions without already being able to recognise sentences with given truth-conditions. One version of this point is couched in terms of whether a Martian could learn what chess is without a prior grasp of games or without being trained to recognise what chess is in a non-discursive manner.234 I do not think such a debate could be easily arbitrated. Who (on earth) knows what and how such things could be learnt? The same point is put with less allusion to fiction like so: if a description of linguistic behaviour is given in terms other than linguistic behaviour, then there could be many different linguistic behaviours for any given non-linguistically described behaviour that we consider. So a theorist could not work with the latter to derive the former.235 This is reasonable. But again, it is open to dispute in a way that unless the terms of the debate are more sharply circumscribed, will not be pursued fruitfully. But is it true that in order to say something more about the speaking episode than merely ―someone asserts something‖ we have to adopt the cosmic exile's perspective? I do not think so. We have a specific explanatory request: what is an assertion if not the production of a sentence (in context, with force) by a speaker with a given classificatory disposition? McDowell provides no reason to believe that answers to this request must be of a reductive kind. He only offers reasons (whether they are decisive or not) to think that answers of a reductive sort are 233 (McDowell 1981 [1998], p.329) 234 (McDowell 1981 [1998], pp.327-330) 235 (McDowell 1987 [1998], p.96). The point eventually gets worked up into something similar to one that (McDowell 1997 [1998], pp.114-118) finds in Wittgenstein's rulefollowing discussion. 178 unlikely to be forthcoming.236 So McDowell's first charge (of impossibility) does not apply to our request that more be said about assertion. Second, McDowell makes a charge against the necessity of Dummett's alternative. This charge focuses on an epistemic principle that Dummett has purportedly adopted but which is false and so ought not to be adopted: ...the title of a state to count as knowledge depends on there being facts, unproblematically available to its possessor, that constitute a guarantee that the content of the putative knowledge is true. (McDowell 1981 [1998], p.335) If Dummett abides by it then he is supposing that there must always be some unproblematic intermediary of which a knower is immediately aware and by means of which she knows that p (if she does).237 An example of this would be a view of perception according to which one knows that the light is on by means of sensations of colour and shape. One then infers from the colours and shape that the light is on. The trouble with this is that generally, for the kinds of thing which are allowed as the immediately known, they do not support an inference to that which is not immediately known. In the current case the immediately known would be what we have treated as elements of the speaking episode. That which is to be derived therefrom would be the classificatory disposition of the speaker. For this charge to be levelled at us we must have adopted a principle of the relevant sort in defending premise (2) of TIA. If we have, then rejecting it is one way to see that Stenius' attitude is not compulsory. If we have adopted any principle of this sort, it is a special case of the general version. Nothing in what has been said in favour of premise (2) requires us to suppose that generally to know something one has to know it via some 236 One might accuse me here of attempting an explanation instead of a mere description simply because I am seeking an answer to a question (cf. (McDowell 1978 [1998], p.312) and (McDowell 1980 [1998], p.36). However, insofar as there is a worthwhile distinction to be drawn between description and explanation it is not properly drawn by whether one seeks to answer a question. Descriptions can be incoherent. If they are, then questions requesting explanation can reasonably arise. What we have been addressing is an incoherence of description that arises when a standard part of a description of the things that take place in communication is forfeited. We are looking to see how the description of a communicative exchange can be made coherent with this forfeiture. 237 (McDowell 1981 [1998], pp.338-340) makes the further charge that adopting the general principle renders Dummett's favoured immediate base just as problematic as that which he thinks is not immediately available. 179 unproblematic intermediary. If we have adopted a principle of this sort which is less general, what might it be? What is true is that we have assumed that how the speaker classifies the sentence is not something immediately available to an onlooker of a speaking episode (if the hypothesis is false). This assumption seems reasonable given our gloss of the speaking episode. That it follows from this, as we are supposing it does, that communication is not possible, is clearly a reason to think the speaking episode as we have glossed it is not the speaking episode we face as daily talkers. But then the question we have been asking remains: what exactly is wrong with our gloss on the speaking episode? We already suspect that there is something wrong with it. That is why we are not rejecting OS in the face of TIA. The necessity of Dummett's alternative might be undermined by rejecting the general principle McDowell outlines. But the need for an explanation as to what is wrong with our original gloss on a speaking episode remains. And to repeat: simply saying that a speaking episode is such that there is no problem (e.g. that it includes that wonder-act: the assertion) will not sate our explanatory appetite. I conclude that we cannot carry over McDowell's attack on Dummett's gloss on speech behaviour to our own. This is for two reasons. The first is that McDowell's alternative, given its quietist tinge, is not distinguishable enough from our own problematic gloss of speech behaviour to show why premise (2) is false without adopting the hypothesis. The second is that Dummett's own gloss is combined with ambitions we do not have and McDowell's criticisms of Dummett seize upon those ambitions. It is worth mentioning just one more thing. We should not forget that McDowell was proposing that we simply learn to recognise assertions when we learn a language because he was attempting to halt a Dummettian argument for antirealism. That argument, recall, is that a speaker must be able to manifest her knowledge of truth-conditions in her linguistic behaviour; that behaviour consists of assenting/dissenting behaviour; but for undecidable sentences no behaviour of that sort manifests the truth-conditions of the sentence; hence the meaning of the sentence is not to be identified with truth-conditions. One might now raise the following concern: if one does not take McDowell's way out, is one not committed to the conclusion of Dummett's argument? 180 We should distinguish two problems. The first is whether, by giving application criteria so central a position in determining the extensions of expressions, we have committed ourselves to significant limitations on what the extensions of expressions can be. Earlier in response to this I distinguished between two senses in which a speaker employs application criteria.238 A speaker can operate an expression with a given application criterion in the sense of knowing what would be its referent, satisfier, condition of truth, and yet, not be able to employ the application to come to a view about the referent, satisfier, or condition of truth. For this reason, an inability to check on the truth-condition of a sentence does not mean the sentence cannot have that truth-condition as determined by certain application criteria. The second problem is whether, given the materials of a speaking episode, it is possible to identify what a speaker classifies as falling within the extension of her expressions as there uttered, without having learnt a regularity to which the speaker conforms in speaking. The distinction between senses in which application criteria are employed allows us to resolve the first problem while leaving untouched the second. Grant the distinction, and it can still be a puzzle how an interlocutor recognises the application criteria (or application criteria with the same verdicts as the application criteria) employed by the speaker without relying on a long regularity in the extensions of expressions employed. For this reason, we can reject McDowell's proposal without automatically committing ourselves to a semantic anti-realism. 4 The two exceptions to McDowell's quietism There still remain the two exceptions to McDowell's quietism. We can make quick work of the first. McDowell proposes that to perform an assertion is to do two things. Firstly, and always, to publicise an intention to say something. Secondly, and sometimes, to let someone know something.239 I have no need to quarrel with such a proposal. We need only note that the first is a proposal about ―force‖ as independent of any question about the truth-conditions of a sentence and the second is a proposal about something like a Austinian perlocutionary effect. We have already seen how these are no help in addressing our concern with premise (2). 238 Chapter IV, section 3.3. 239 (McDowell 1980 [1998], p.42) 181 The second exception is actually rather promising. McDowell discusses two views on the work done by different components of a theory of meaning. A theory of meaning will have two parts. The first part, a theory of content, will specify the truth-conditions of sentences. The second part, a theory of force, relates sentences to acts that can be performed with sentences. The dispute between McDowell and Dummett, at least as McDowell presents it, is over whether there is a behavioural correlate of the theory of content independent of the theory of force.240 Whereas Dummett thinks that one could provide behavioural correlates for a theory that describes the truth-conditions of sentences autonomously from a theory of force, McDowell does not think such can be done. Now, for the most part, it is not clear what the difference would be between a Dummettian and a McDowellian theory in this respect because McDowell says so little about what it is about the subject matter of a theory of force which when not rendered separable from the subject matter of a theory of content would change the kind of behaviour we would be discussing: I am just repeating here the earlier complaint that McDowell says less than enough to distinguish assertion from producing a sentence, in context, with force, and toward which a speaker has a given classificatory disposition. However, the second exception to McDowell's quietism is a point in one paper wherein he ever so slightly embellishes his proposal. He writes: ...the description of propositional acts that it [a theory of meaning] yields should fit coherently into a wider context in which the speaker's behaviour in general, including both their linguistic behaviour, under those descriptions, and their non-linguistic behaviour, under suitable descriptions, can be made sufficiently intelligible in the light of propositional attitudes (centrally, beliefs and desires) whose ascription to them is sufficiently intelligible in the light of their behaviour, again, and of the facts that impinge on them. Actions are made intelligible by finding descriptions under which one can see how they might have seemed reasonable on the conception sketched here, that applies, as it ought, to linguistic actions just as much as to others. Understanding linguistic behaviour, and hence understanding languages, involves no more than a special case of what understanding behaviour, in general, involves. (McDowell 1976 [1998], p.6. See also pp.17-18). 240 (McDowell 1981 [1998], esp. pp.317-321) 182 This passage is suggestive.241 McDowell reminds us that any description of propositional acts (which includes assertion) needs to cohere with various other descriptions that one provides of a speaker's other behaviour and circumstances. In our own terms this means that whatever classificatory disposition a speaker has toward a sentence she produces, that disposition needs to be something it would be reasonable to employ in the production of the sentence. This suggests that the classificatory disposition of the speaker toward a sentence she utters is not independent of whatever these other descriptions describe (as McDowell would have it: non-linguistic behaviour, propositional attitudes, and the facts that ―impinge on them‖). If they are features of the speaking episode then, given that they do indeed provide the reasonable speaker with reason to employ words with a certain classificatory disposition, the speaking episode places a rational constraint upon the speaker's classificatory disposition. McDowell reminds us that uttering a sentence is an action subject to the same constraints of rationality as any other action. Such constraints may well inflate a speaking episode in a way that allows us to reject premise (2) of TIA. 4.1 Some terms: ―means‖ and ―ends‖ Let us clarify the suggestion. To do this I will introduce some terms and then restate McDowell's proposal using them. There are things one does which one does in order to do or be doing something else. For instance, one is at the swimming pool. One kicks one's legs and moves one's arms in order to propel oneself forward or so that one is moving forward. Or similarly, one types on the keyboard in order to produce a chapter or so that one is typing a chapter. I am going to use the terminology of means and ends to describe this. A means does not have to be temporally prior to the achievement of the end. They can be coincident. We already have two examples of this: kicking legs to be swimming; typing on a keyboard to be writing a chapter. Let us say that if one does A in order to do or be doing B then B is one's end and A is one's means. I am going to mean by ―end‖ only that which is in some sense intentional as opposed to accidental. So if one does something and it has a given (possibly simultaneous) result the result is not necessarily an end of one's activity. An intuitive grasp of the 241 McDowell is in effect disputing Austin's (1975, p.103) claim about the relation between the illocutionary and the perlocutionary aspects of speaking. 183 intentional/accidental distinction ought to be clear enough to navigate the discussion to follow. There is a distinction between the telicities of a verb.242 For instance, ―John was swimming‖ contrasts with ―John was crossing the street‖ because whereas the latter can be true even if John never crossed the street, the former cannot be true if John never swam. One might want to reserve the word ―end‖ for the cases in which there is a telos in the sense that is present in ―John was crossing the street‖ but absent in ―John was swimming.‖ I am not using the word ―end‖ in such a restricted way. That one is swimming can be one's end as I am using the word ―end.‖ I will be supposing one's ends give one reasons to do things which are means to those ends and reasons to avoid doing things which thwart one's ends, and further, I will suppose that someone who is rational will act in accordance with what they have reason to do and to avoid doing. For example, if an end of mine is to stay alive, then I have a reason to only walk across a busy main road when the traffic is clear. If I want some food then I have reason to do something that will result in me being in the state of having some food, e.g. going to the fridge. I am not supposing that one has only one end at a time. In reality, one has a great many of them at any one time. Pursing a means to one end may fatally curtail one's capacity to pursue another. For instance, one's attempt to eat the cake will undermine one's life, seeing as the cake is poisoned. One has to balance these things and that is going to be a complicated story but again I think we can have a fruitful discussion without taking up views on what is involved in this. What it is rational for one to do will depend not only upon one's ends but upon of what one is aware. So if the cake is poisoned but one was not aware of this, and what one was aware of gave no reason to think one should check whether the cake was poisoned but did give one reason to eat the cake, then, one was not irrational in eating the cake even though doing so undermines some of one's ends. We could say there was a reason to not eat the cake or even that he had good reason to not eat the cake but he was not aware of that reason. However, all I want to register here is that what it is rational for a person to do, and so what one would expect someone to do if they are rational, depends upon what they are aware of. 242 (Vendler 1967) 184 I want to note two features of means and ends as sketched here. The first feature is that with changes in one's ends, there are changes in the status of activities as means to one's ends. This is because only certain activities will result in certain ends. Thus one's ends place rational constraints on one's activities. They constrain what one ought to do if one has certain ends. So for example, if I want to get to King's Cross then I ought to take certain buses rather than others because only some buses are means to that end. Given I have that aim I have reason to take certain buses rather than others. Or again, if I want to learn philosophy, I have a reason to spend a portion of my time doing certain activities rather than others, e.g. reading philosophy books rather than novels or sitting in the sun.243 In this way there can be changes in one's reason for doing things. The second feature of means and ends that I want to note is that changes of circumstance can change the status of something as a means to a given end. For example, whether I am walking north depends upon whether I have my bearings right. If I took a wrong turn, then unbeknownst to me I would be walking south rather than north. In walking or by walking I am not then walking north. Whether my walking is my doing that depends upon the circumstances. There is a sense in which even when in some sense I am not walking north, I can still be said truly to be walking north. Suppose for instance that I have to take a minor road which goes back on itself slightly. I could still report that I was going north if someone was trying to check my general movements, and so where I will be in the next 20 minutes.244 But that that is so does not change the fact that in another sense I will not be walking north in walking at that time, despite the fact that if my walk were differently oriented to my surroundings, I would be. This is all I mean to draw attention to. Similarly, my moving of my arms and legs is not my swimming if, for instance, I am not in any water, or, they are not coordinated in such a fashion as to result in me guiding myself through the water. Although of course once again I could report what I was doing as swimming in the sense that I had apportioned a part of my day to attending the swimming pool, that is beside the point. Whether I am at a given instant swimming in the sense of propelling myself through the water by kicking my legs and moving my arms depends upon the circumstances in 243 (Anscombe 1957 [2000], p.36) 244 (Falvey 2000) 185 which I make those movements. Those movements do not make that the case all by themselves. 4.2 McDowell's proposal: a restatement McDowell's proposal can now be put like so. Suppose that an agent has various ends in the speaking episode. This makes producing sentences with such and such a classificatory disposition to a greater or lesser extent a rational thing to do. If we suppose that the agent is rational, the ends someone is recognisably pursuing in the circumstances of the speaking episode constrain what classificatory disposition she could have toward the sentences she produces. Thus the speaking episode constrains the classificatory disposition a speaker could be employing toward the words she produces in the speaking episode. We had originally supposed that in the speaking episode the speaker attempts to communicate by producing linguistic expressions (in context, with force). The implication in saying this, without mentioning anything else she is trying to do, is that she is not trying to do anything else which is relevant to considering the truthconditions of the sentences she produces. In effect, the current proposal is to explicitly discard this implication. The simple model of communication is not discarded; it is being recognised for what it is: an abstraction. McDowell's proposal allows us to challenge premise (2) in the following way. If the speaker is pursuing projects in uttering given expressions in a speaking episode and these projects, pursued in these circumstances, rationally require employing those expressions with a given classificatory disposition, then the speaking episode places (sufficient) rational constraints on the speaker's classificatory disposition to identify one disposition in particular and therefore the speaking episode does not underdetermine the classificatory disposition of the speaker. Using McDowell's observation to inflate the speaking episode is not subject to the criticisms we levelled against either his first proposal or Austin's proposal. If we describe the further ends of a speaker, and the circumstances of speaking, and show how these rationally require a speaker to use expressions in certain ways, then we are not being quietist in the way that was unsatisfactory. Further, the kind of constraint placed upon the speaker's classificatory disposition on the current proposal need not be conventional. If the constraints placed arise even 186 when there is no long regularity in the substantial expressions she produces as understood by her interlocutor, then the constraint would remain even if the hypothesis were false. 4.3 McDowell's proposal: two misplaced objections and one difficult challenge There are two easy objections against using McDowell's proposal for our purposes. The first is that someone's ends do not place rational constraints upon what classificatory disposition a speaker has toward a sentence because her ends are neither furthered nor thwarted by employing one combination of expression and extension over any other. Given the non-essentiality of the extension of an expression, any combination would be as good as any other for saying what the speaker wants to say. A second objection is that there would be no reason to use some words rather than any others if things were as proposed. But clearly what words one employs does make a difference: one cannot say anything one likes with just any words. Hence the proposal cannot be correct.245 The first objection is misplaced. While it may be true that there is no reason to favour one expression-extension combination over others, the speaker's other projects may still give speakers reason to operate whatever expressions they do operate so that they have some extensions and not others. For example, suppose I try to give some indication as to where your book is. Suppose I do so by uttering an expression which refers to the location in question. If what I count as falling within the extension of the expression is an item of which you have no knowledge, and which has no bearing on the location of your book, then I would not be being rational in producing the expression with the extension that I have. So I have a reason not to use the expression in this way, given my aim. That is so even though there may be no reason for me to use one expression rather than any other to do the indicating. These two issues need to be kept separate. What is a reason to produce an expression (no expression in particular) with some particular extension 245 This second objection is levelled by (Dummet 1986, p.474) and (Reimer 2004, pp.323-324) against (Davidson 1986). Davidson proposes something similar to McDowell. Dummett and Reimer however exaggerate Davidson's position in making their complaint. Davidson does not say that words contribute nothing to what can be done with them. But unless this is supposed, the objection does not apply. 187 need not be a reason to prefer one array of expression-extension combinations over others. As for the second objection, I want to say two things. Firstly, the proposal is not that words contribute nothing to what can be said by their means. We are denying that what words contribute determines either an extension or an extension relativised to various further factors for a long longevity. So we are not committed to the absurdity that while speaking English properly one could correctly use ―green‖ to speak of red things. Secondly, the exact choice of words someone makes in speaking is not obviously our explanandum. Whenever one does say something there are bound to be alternatives to most of the words that one employed to say what one said which would have done just as well for the then current purposes, even though on another occasion a distinction might be made by means of those words. Consider occasions on which someone else tries finishing your sentence as you speak and they select a different word from that which you actually select but which is just as good for saying, in those circumstances, what one wanted to say. In such cases, despite the words not being synonyms, they are interchangeable for current purposes even though in other circumstances the words could be used to draw a distinction. For example, consider the following excerpts from an exchange between an attorney and an alleged rape victim: A: You went to a bar in the city, is that correct? W: It's a club. A: It's where girls and fellas meet isn't it? W: People go there. A: An during the evening, didn't Mistuh so-and-so come over tuh sit with you? W: Sat at our table. 188 In each case, the alleged victim distinguishes her own words from those used by the attorney and thereby makes a distinction between two things that might have taken place.246 But clearly the words, in other circumstances, would be interchangeable.247 To see this consider the second question above: and during that evening, didn't Mr so-and-so come over to sit with you? Consider the following circumstance in which an answer might be given. John is looking for his friend, Bob. He gets emotional when he's been drinking. John doesn't like leaving him alone too long or his darker thoughts may get too great a grip for the evening to continue. John asks, ―he came over to sit with you?‖ the alleged victim might reply, in these circumstances, ―yeah, but that was a while ago.‖ Here there is no need for her to distinguish between coming to sit with her and coming to sit at the table where she and others were seated. There would not be any point to doing so. But despite this, in other circumstances, to describe the same situation, the same words might be used to draw a distinction as we can see going on in the crossexamination. Again, there is often (I would propose always) alternative words to the ones one uses to say what one said even though in some circumstances one could draw distinctions by their means. In regard to this it is also worth remembering that when someone speaks only some things are remembered of what happened when they did so. Think of what you remember happening when you recall someone's phone call to you yesterday, for instance. By and large the words are not remembered even though you remember what happened.248 This is not what one should expect if the exact words chosen were so important to doing what one does in speaking. A more substantial difficulty with the proposal lies elsewhere. If the current proposal is to allow us to reject premise (2) then we need to be able to specify means and ends which constrain to uniqueness the classificatory disposition of a speaker. The more substantial difficulty is meeting this challenge. A major stumbling block is that it very much appears as though it is possible to tell someone something without there being any further end that one is pursuing in doing this, and the telling be intelligible. There appears to be a practice of 246 If you are tempted here to introduce a Gricean distinction between what was said strictly speaking and what was merely implicated, then see discussion of a main criterion for drawing that distinction in Chapter II. 247 See (Drew 1992, p.492). The excerpts are taken from his paper. 248 Cf. (Sachs 1967) and (Neisser 1981) 189 (intelligible) bare assertion. But if there is such a practice then, in such cases, there are no rational constraints on the classificatory disposition of the speaker of the kind we are considering. So in order to make this proposal work, something about this appearance needs to be disputed. But given the intuitive appeal of the appearance, one might think that this alone speaks against the proposal. Communication as we have glossed it is not the same as bare assertion. For an exercise in bare assertion a speaker has to produce a sentence perhaps aiming to get someone to think something but nothing more. There must be nothing else influencing what it is that the speaker does. To communicate (how things are) is for someone to come to know of how the world is by observing someone's speech behaviour. Communication can involve the pursuit of other ends in producing a sentence. What is at issue is whether there are cases of communication that are cases of bare assertion. The doubters assuredly suppose that (intelligible) bare assertion is a practice of ours. Bloomfield supposes that all that takes place when communication happens is that a speaker produces movements of her vocal chords which vibrate the air, and it is this to which a hearer is responsive.249 When Cappelen and Lepore ask how communication could be possible given the truth of what they call ―radical contextualism‖ they ask after one's understanding of what we the readers would have said by uttering the sentence ―Philosophy is fun.‖250 They do not consider what the speaker might have been trying to do in uttering the sentence; the implication being that nothing else is relevant. Hornsby focuses entirely on a case in which the only end of the speaker is to ―be taken to mean what one wants to be taken to mean.‖251 Lewis thinks the most general use of language is one on which the only thing a speaker aims to do is to induce a belief in the hearer.252 Stanley operates with a conception of conversation which can be analysed as ―acquiring and conveying information about the world,‖253 apparently without further (relevant) end. Stenius proposes that if a sentence is in the indicative mood then a speaker of the sentence is playing a ―report game‖ according to which the only aim a speaker 249 (Bloomfield 1933 [1979], pp.25-27) 250 (Cappelen and Lepore 2005, p.124) 251 (Hornsby 2009, p.110) 252 (Lewis 1969, p.180) 253 (Stanley 2007, p.12) 190 has is to communicate something associated with a sentence.254 Stenius believes that what is to be understood by someone's utterance can be clearly delineated once this alone is in place. Reimer considers only a speaker's intention to communicate that p and ignores what other pressures might impinge upon her in speaking.255 That they make this supposition provides a tempting explanation as to why the doubters think rejection of the hypothesis entails commitment to premise (2) of TIA: it saves that premise from McDowell's proposal. If we are going to take up McDowell's proposal we need to do two things. We need to show what kind of thing a speaker might be trying to do which would, given the circumstances, rationally require her to adopt a given classificatory disposition. Further, we need to address the stumbling block of bare assertion. 254 (Stenius 1967, p.264, pp.269-271) 255 (Reimer 2004, p.323) 191 C H A P T E R V I I Politely calibrating words for use by someone else 1 Introduction The next section of this chapter will introduce an end which would require a speaker to use words in certain ways rather than others, given the circumstances in which the end is being pursued. I give three examples of situations in which such an end is being pursued. Anyone aware that that was the social terrain the speaker was navigating in speaking, and who knew the speaker to be behaving rationally, could become aware that the speaker was using her words with a given classificatory disposition. Speech actions of this category are instances of talk for which premise (2) of TIA is false. The rest of the chapter will take a (I think, significant) step toward removing the stumbling block mentioned at the end of the previous chapter. The stumbling block was that it seems we engage in (intelligible) bare assertion. I consider a specific presentation of this claim by Lewis. He supports the claim by citing the case of ―idle chat‖ as one of intelligible bare assertion. I argue that idle chat is not idle in the required sense. Perhaps there is intelligible bare assertion. But the most obvious candidate for that is no such thing. Before we begin I want to make a note of what I mean by ―comprehension.‖ Consider the difference between the following. Someone can utter a sentence, for instance, ―the chair is old,‖ and one can see how it could be made true by some particular item, e.g. Ruth's chair. So in a sense one understands the sentence as uttered. But in another sense, one may well have not understood. For instance, 192 suppose that in the circumstances, only something that qualifies as an antique can satisfy ―is old.‖ In that case Ruth's chair would not make the sentence true despite the fact that it could make it true. This would show itself in that if you were to interrupt the conversation by saying, ―It is old, in a sense,‖ you would be scorned for drawing attention to an irrelevance, or worse. What is at issue in this chapter is comprehension of a sentence in the second sense and not the first. 2 Calibrating for use by someone else On the view argued in Chapter IV, linguistic expressions do not include their own application criteria. That is something left open for a user of those expressions to establish upon the occasion for using them. As we put it there, she has to analyse a scene where any given scene can be analysed in lots of different ways. This was thought to be so for a reason: there are no application criteria which if employed together, in operation of expressions as parts of a semantic calculus, would be noncontingently balanced. Hence, in order for one to reason validly with the application criteria available, one has to find those that will give rise to a balanced calculus in the circumstances of their employment. In what follows I will use the expression ―semantic calculus‖ to speak of not only a substantially interpreted formal semantics but one that includes certain sentences of the object language of the formal semantics that are held to be true. I will also use the word ―sentence‖ in a slightly stretched way. I allow that two things could be the same sentence even if they do not include the same words.256 What I am interested in is items which play the same role in a formal semantics with respect to (a) the extension of the expressions that make up the sentence and (b) the horizontal principles within which the sentence figures. If two sentences, in the more ordinary sense, are the same with respect to (a) and (b) then I will say they are the same sentence in the broader sense I am going to employ. The point of allowing this stretched usage is that it allows me to speak of a semantic calculus which includes sentences held true by an interlocutor where there are not any particular words (in the more usual sense) that need to be employed in the reasoning or talk of this interlocutor. 256 The move is the same as was made in Chapter IV when introducing the notion of ―analysing a scene.‖ 193 Now, back in Chapter IV we were concerned with a solitary reasoner using a system of classification (an applied semantic calculus) to reason validly (in application) about a collection of items. But it is also possible for more than one person to use a single semantic calculus to reason about a scene. One way for two persons to do this is as follows. The hearer already has in place a semantic calculus (a particular analysis of a scene). The speaker produces expressions for the hearer to employ within that calculus. For example, you employ the sentence ―If John weighs less than 80kg then it will not be the case that the lift will fall‖ and I come to produce a sentence, presenting it as true, which you attempt to combine with your conditional, namely, ―John weighs less than 80kg.‖ Then you would have in place a semantic calculus and I would have produced a sentence that you the hearer employ within your calculus. Things can go awry in this venture. Suppose that the way in which I operate ―weighs less than 80kg‖ is such that when it figures in a semantic calculus alongside the other two sentences, the application criteria employed are unbalanced. Your application criteria and my application criteria when combined into a single calculus produce an unbalanced calculus. Because of this it is possible for the sentences in this semantic calculus to be assigned values as follows: I([S [NP John][Pred weighs less than 80kg]])M,w,i,c,g = 1; I([S If [S [NP John][Pred weighs less than 80kg]] then [S It is not the case that [S [NP The lift][Pred will fall]]]])M,w,i,c,g = 1; but I([S It is not the case that [S [NP The lift][Pred will fall]]])M,w,i,c,g = 0. If one aims to enable a hearer's valid (in application) reasoning then one ought to employ application criteria, whatever they might be, such that in the circumstances, the hearer's reasoning would be valid (in application). But as was argued in Chapter IV, what will enable that will depend upon the circumstances. If it is clear to both one and one's hearer that one is calibrating one's words for use in the calculus in which the hearer is going to use the words to reason, then, it will be clear that whatever application criteria one employs, one is doing so in a way that enables valid reasoning and thus, it will be clear, given suitable circumstances, what the extensions of one's expressions are when one speaks. In this way, the classificatory disposition is constrained by the end of the speaker in speaking in, and the circumstances of, the speaking episode. Thus, one kind of circumstance in which the speaking episode constrains the classificatory disposition of the speaker has the following characteristics: 194 1) There is a scene which can be described with expressions of a particular semantic calculus, including logically complex expressions. This is done by employing the expressions with given application criteria: thus applied, the expressions' application criteria will categorise the elements into those which fall within the extension of given expressions and those which do not. 2) The speaker produces words. 3) In producing the words of (2) the speaker aims to produce words which can be used by the hearer in the calculus of (1). 4) The hearer will use the words as part of the calculus of (1). 5) The hearer is aware that the speaker is using words in such a way that they can be used as part of the calculus of (1). The application criteria employed by the speaker to operate her expressions will need to be balanced for use in the hearer's calculus if the semantic rules of the calculus are to enable valid (in application) reasoning about those items by the hearer. For ease of reference let us say that speaking episodes with features (1)-(5) are polite speaking episodes. In polite speaking episodes there would be a rational constraint upon the speaker's classificatory disposition toward the expression she produces in the speaking episode. By ―rational‖ I mean what I meant in Chapter VI: it is rational to pursue a given activity insofar as it furthers and does not hinder one's ends. Suppose the speaker has an end. She pursues this end by producing a sentence. But, if the circumstances are rich enough, in order for her producing the sentence to be a means to her end, she has to produce it in a certain way. Thus she is under rational pressure to produce the sentence in that way. Although it is clear that the hearer is not going to use the expressions in just whatever way the speaker is using them (she is going to use them in accordance with her calculus), there may be a concern that the constraint this kind of speaking episode places upon the speaker's classificatory disposition is no more than that the speaker try to use her expressions in whatever way the hearer is using them. To fend off this concern I want to register two features of the kind of situation under discussion. The first is that the speaker need not use the expressions with the same application criteria as her interlocutor; provided that the relevant reasoning with such expressions is nonetheless balanced. For instance, in the case of John's weight 195 you might count John's weighing less than 80kg by how he looks (you can make such estimates by the eye pretty well) whereas I rely upon the scale reading. Provided these two coincide in their verdicts, there is no reason why, for the purposes of the bit of reasoning we are considering, the particular criteria employed to get those verdicts, need to be the same. So in regard to the application criteria employed, the speaker is not aiming to use the expressions in the same way as the hearer. Secondly, what will balance a shared calculus is not something that either or both interlocutors can stipulate or make so by agreeing to count as so. If both were to use the expression with application criteria which unbalance the calculus, that they are both using the expression in that way does not make the calculus balanced. Whether the verdicts of the application criteria employed of different expressions will conform to the principles of the calculus is something decided by the way the world is arranged. For example, whether or not the way in which one applies the sentence, ―John weighs less than 80kg,‖ and the conditional, ―If John weighs less than 80kg then it is not the case that the lift will fall,‖ is balanced depends upon whether items to which one applies the application criteria are such that if these two sentences are true then the application criterion for ―the lift will fall‖ returns the verdict 0. For this reason, the hearer herself could be mistaken about how to use the expression correctly. What counts as correct use of the expression depends upon a feature of the situation that is objective and to which both interlocutors aim and both may fail to achieve. In this way, the interlocutors face not so much a coordination problem as they do an engineering problem. Polite speaking episodes are of interest because they are situations for which premise (2) of TIA is false.257 For unlike situations in which a speaker is simply trying to use her words in the same way as her interlocutor, in polite speaking episodes there are rational pressures on speakers to operate expressions in certain ways rather than others where that pressure is not exerted by the end of using an expression in the same way as one's interlocutor. Compare this with a remark by Evans. A student reads out an essay which we are to suppose requires stating how a car engine works. The student says the sentence, 257 Recall that premise (2) is: the speaking episode underdetermines the classificatory disposition of the speaker. 196 ―A spark is produced electrically inside the carburettor,‖ and a classmate says, ―He means the cylinder.‖ Of this Evans says: ...to be saying that a spark is produced in the cylinder is what, given his general plans and his situation, the subject should be doing; that is, doing that is what would conform best with the subject's plans at this moment. The truth which he should have been trying to express at this point is that a spark is produced in the cylinder. (Evans 1982, pp.130-131) The classmate knew what the student ought to have been saying because she knew what the student was trying to do in uttering his sentence and how this constrained what he ought to do with his words. That is precisely the present point. If the circumstances of someone's speaking and her ends in speaking are rich enough, then there are ways the speaker ought to be using her words, and anyone (suitably equipped) could see that that was so who was able to witness the speaking episode and its circumstances. This is despite the falsity of the hypothesis. We are not supposing that there need be any regularity in the extension of expressions across different occasions of speaking. I will now describe three examples of polite speaking episodes. These are examples wherein the speaking episode places rational constraints upon the speaker's classificatory disposition toward the sentence(s) she utters. 2.1 Giving directions The scene is Pentonville Road. Doors line the sides of the road. They have colours. The semantic calculus to be employed is one in which the conditional, ―if Alex's door is colour C, and the door is colour C, then the door is the entrance to Alex's flat,‖ is held to be true. That covers (1). The speaker utters the words ―My door is green.‖ That covers (2). There is then a question of what application criteria ought to be employed for ―my door‖ and ―is green.‖ Given the application criteria for ―Alex's door‖ and ―colour C‖ and ―entrance to Alex's flat,‖ certain application criteria ought to be employed for operating ―My door‖ and ―is green‖ which are such that, if they are combined with the conditional, in the same calculus, the application criteria are balanced. Notably, the street scene as the hearer walks down Pentonville Road will have to be similarly analysed by the interlocutors. That could fail to be so. They might count different things as doors, so that something 197 that the speaker classifies as a gate, the hearer classifies as a door, and since it is green, he makes a mistake about where the speaker's flat is. Similarly, they might diverge about what exactly should be classified as green (for current purposes). The hearer might classify almost grey doors as green doors whereas this is not what the speaker's application criteria would have the speaker count as within the extension of her use of ―green.‖258 If we suppose there is this agreement, and that the speaker aims to produce an expression to be wielded as part of the calculus of (1), then that covers (3). We may suppose that the hearer will use the sentence ―My door is green‖ as part of her calculus. That covers (4). Finally we may suppose that the hearer is aware that the speaker has the aim she does. That covers (5). Given all this, the speaker faces a challenge: find application criteria for her expressions that will enable the hearer to reason validly (in application) with them. Let us focus on ―is green.‖ Items can be categorised as green in many different ways (while still, for all that, speaking English). One division between ways of doing this is between considering the colour of the first coat of paint an item ever received or its latest coat of paint. There are reasons to be interested in either.259 Depending upon which of these one employs one will get different verdicts as to whether the speaker's door is green. Which should the speaker use? By ―irrational‖ we mean selection of a means that is not a means to one's end. Because the speaker aims to enable the hearer to reason about the speaker's door in relation to the other items on the street (when searching for the speaker's flat), it would be irrational for the speaker to employ the word ―green‖ with certain application criteria in the exchange in which she gives directions to the hearer to the flat; for example, such that when viewed from outside the speaker's flat, the door appears red, but when placed in green light looks green. A person walking down the street cannot, by observing the doors, as he passes them, readily classify them as the speaker's or 258 I have certainly had this experience when someone's giving directions. If someone says ―take the second left‖ one can find oneself unsure whether a narrow alleyway counts as something one should be counting as a ―left.‖ 259 An example of a situation in which one would be interested in the first coat of paint is this. Suppose that there is an infamous room in which a murder took place. It is known that the room is in 256 Pentonville Road but it is not known which room it is. It is known however that the original colour of the room was a pale lilac. Someone could ask, ―was it a green room? The kitchen's green, see, so I'm wondering‖ and what would make true this claim that the kitchen is green would be the first coat of paint the kitchen received. Its latest coat of paint would not be relevant. 198 not and so base his action on such a classification.260 So the speaker ought not to use the word ―green‖, in these circumstances, in that way. An objection one could raise at this point is as follows. Surely the application criteria of the expressions of the calculus with which the hearer would reason but which the speaker does not utter cannot be taken for granted. The speaker needs to know what these are. But then the speaker not only faces the challenge of employing expressions with application criteria that form a balanced calculus with these other expressions. She faces the challenge of identifying the whole calculus. But if this is so then we are returned to the very predicament that encouraged Stenius' attitude. For there is nothing about the speaking episode which constrains what semantic calculus within which the hearer will use the speaker's words. I accept the objector's initial observation but not the consequence she attempts to draw from it. I agree that the speaker will need to recognise the hearer's semantic calculus but the current proposal is that within speaking episodes there are activities taking place, in given circumstances, within which the speaker's words play a given role. The semantic calculus for which the speaker is to calibrate her words is determined by this activity and its circumstances. Thus the speaking episode introduces severe rational constraints on how the speaker ought to use her expressions (i.e. what her classificatory disposition ought to be) if she is using her words as a participant to that activity. These constraints are not conventional: one does not fulfil them just by agreeing with one's interlocutor that one has fulfilled them. Nor are these constraints a part of the speaking episode as initially glossed. So in accepting the initial observation we do not return ourselves to the original predicament. 2.2 Ordering coffee The scene is the Nero's cafe on High Holborn at 830am on a weekday morning. There is a long queue of city workers and four baristas serve behind the counter. There is a menu on the wall behind the baristas on which are listed items, sometimes varying in size, and alongside them quantities of money like, ―£1.85.‖ 260 This is not necessarily so. Suppose there is a street with green street lights but under which most doors appear brown, while mine, which in daylight looks white, looks green. Burglars planning their next night attack might declare their target by speaking of, ―the one with the green door‖ and say, ―We are doing the one with the green door‖ and speak truly. 199 In the scene a sequence unfolds as follows. A barista will walk along the queue trying to catch the eye of customers who have not been served. Sometimes she will do this by asking, ―are you being served?‖ When someone looks like they have not been served she looks at them and either waits for a response (which will be a ―hello‖ and then an order, or simply the order without the ―hello‖) or asks, ―what would you like?‖ or something similar. This is not a general inquiry nor is it any other particular inquiry (e.g. what would you like for dinner this evening? or what would you like to eat from the Costa five shops west?). It is an inquiry into what from the menu of this cafe the customer wants to buy. The customer will then make an order.261 The barista gets the order. When it is ready the customer is called from the queue to the till. The barista announces a price (usually without formulating this in terms of a question). The customer hands over the money. Change is given. The customer leaves. The barista looks for her next customer. The barista in this sequence employs a calculus which includes the following conditionals: ―If the customer wants a small Americano to go, then I should place two shot glasses under the machine, turn on the machine, find a small paper cup, empty one expresso shot into the cup, fill the rest with water, place the lid on top, then call the customer over to the till.‖ That covers (1): we have a scene and a calculus. Within this the customer produces words which one can find on the menu. They do so knowing that the hearer (the barista) will employ those words in certain ways because of the roles they have adopted with respect to one another. This covers (2) and (3). We know (4) is so of this case because we know the barista will guide her subsequent movements in different ways depending upon what the customer says in highly predictable ways. The barista in this case can know that the speaker is producing words to be used as part of the calculus she employs. So (5) is so of this example too. 261 Generally. The customer might turn out to be someone applying for a job or someone making a complaint or requesting information about an umbrella they left there yesterday and so on. Often however one finds that people with such purposes do not queue. They go to find a free barista directly behaving in a manner which is quite different from someone who is making an order. So things are more complicated than I am letting on. But I doubt a microsociological analysis of the kind of situation I am describing would take longer than a small book to describe. For the way in which a customer can influence what she is understood to be doing by modifying her bodily posture and orientation to the surroundings (i.e. without speaking) see (Clark and Pinch 2010). 200 To enable that kind of reasoning to be valid (in application), and given as in the previous example, that the customer and the barista will classify the other elements of the scene before them in similar ways (though not necessarily with the same application criteria), so far as the customer's order is concerned, the customer has to use the expressions she does with certain application criteria rather than others. For instance, the word ―coffee‖ could be used in many different ways. Consider a cup filled with brewed coffee but which has been left for long enough to grow mould. Is that what you wanted? Or consider a cup with coffee beans inside it. Or consider synthetic coffee. Is that coffee? Something with coffee flavouring. Is a brew made of the same species of plant as coffee but which tastes nothing like that plant, a cup of coffee? Is partially digested coffee still coffee? The choice is there for the speaker, when she is in the cafe, to adopt some of many application criteria for the word ―coffee.‖ But why she is there, and given that enough of the circumstances are fixed in which she attempts to do what she is going to do with the expressions, it is clear how she ought to use the word she does in the circumstances. 2.3 Help finding something I sit in the computer room at the KCL philosophy department. I often witness someone step into the computer room and pause and look at the different computers, each with its own blank screen. Consider a calculus someone might apply to this scene which includes the conditional: ―If the computer is working, then one can send emails and print documents from the computer.‖ That covers (1). I would say, when I saw someone enter and behave in the manner described, ―That one's working,‖ pointing at the one that would let people print and send emails. That covers (2). I would do so in an attempt to enable them to find a computer that would enable them to send emails and print documents. That covers (3). They would then sit down at the computer and proceed to do one of these two things, avoiding the other two computers. This covers (4) and we may suppose (5). There are various ways one could classify things as falling within the extension of ―working.‖ For instance, suppose I am standing next to a tech savvy friend as he applies a voltmeter to various computer innards. He says, ―that one's working‖ speaking of one of the computers in the computer room that I never tell incomers is working. This particular computer contrasts with another whose motherboard is fried. All that is wrong with this particular computer is that its graphics card is 201 unplugged. Nonetheless, because its graphics card is unplugged (and its case sealed, when in the computer room) it cannot be used to send emails or print documents. So in one sense it is working and in another it is not. When people enter the computer room evidently looking to do certain things with the computer, when I speak I am attempting to help them find a computer with which to do those things by producing a sentence with which they can reason in the calculus they employ. Once again there will be some reasoning within which my words will figure and I know this, and because of that, in order to do what I seek to do I employ the predicate ―is working‖ with an application criterion which enables the incomers to reason validly (in application) about what to do next. 3 Rejecting premise (2) of TIA Recall the incompatibility argument: 1) A and B can communicate only if the speaking episode does not underdetermine the classificatory disposition of the speaker. (assumption) 2) The speaking episode underdetermines the classificatory disposition of the speaker. (assumption) 3) It is not the case that A and B can communicate (modus tollens, (1) and (2)). We have been searching for a way we can legitimately reject (2). The plausibility of premise (2) rests on the gloss we provided in Chapter V of the speaking episode. We considered and rejected ways to inflate the speaking episode in Chapter VI. By following up a hint from McDowell, we now have on the table a fairly clear way of inflating the speaking episode which has the desired effect. Premise (2) is false when the speaking episode includes a speaker who is attempting to do an action which, given the circumstances, requires her, if she really is to do or be doing the action, to adopt a given classificatory disposition rather than others. The (kind of) action in question is, in our technical sense, speaking politely. Hence, what takes place in the speaking episode places a rational constraint on the speaker's classificatory disposition. For her speaking to be a means to an end it has to be done in a certain way. So if the hearer knows the speaker is being rational and the hearer knows how the expressions would have to be used to be rational in the circumstances, then the hearer can tell how the speaker ought to be, and is, operating her expressions. 202 The role here described for the circumstances of speaking, in speaking, is significantly different from the role played in Austin's account of the phenomena he observed and circumstances' role in further factor views that involve commitment to the hypothesis. In both cases that which, beyond the words, is relevant to the truth-conditions of sentences uttered, is relevant because everyone agrees that it is. For instance, consider the parameters in a non-standard semantic analysis of a sentence that is presented as an attempt to eliminate Travis cases. Why do the circumstances that figure here figure as they do? Because it is a convention that the words are to be so used. It is made so by everyone agreeing that it is so. But on the current view, the role of the circumstances of speaking is very different: the circumstances in which one speaks constrain one's classificatory disposition in the same way the circumstances of an action ordinarily constrain how one acts. If an agent aims to do something, and in the circumstances, only certain ways of doing that would enable her to do or being doing it, then she ought to go about doing that in a way that, in the circumstances, enables her to do or be doing it. The circumstances of a plant are relevant to how it needs to be to achieve good growth. The circumstances of someone climbing a wall are relevant to how she goes about climbing the wall. So too, the circumstances of speaking are relevant to how one wields one's words in speaking. 4 The stumbling block: bare assertion A persistent source of worry about the reason I have provided for denying premise (2) is (it seems) that conditions (3)-(5) of a polite speaking episode do not need to be satisfied in order for communication to be effected: there need be no particular semantic calculus for which the speaker calibrates her words and within which the hearer uses those words. There may be examples (such as those provided above) in which this is quite plausibly so, but says the worrier, surely there are episodes of successful communication which are not polite (in this technical sense)? The rest of this chapter takes some steps toward addressing this worry. We do so by examining a statement by David Lewis of the claim motivating the worry. In his discussion of convention, Lewis considers situations much like polite speaking episodes. He calls them (verbal) signalling systems. Characteristically in signalling systems: the hearer does something in response to the expression a speaker produces; what they do depends upon the expression produced; and both 203 interlocutors know that there is this dependence. Hence, if we suppose that the response of the audience is not unmediated by reason, there will be some reasoning with which the speaker's words figure in a Lewisian signalling system.262 Nothing but irrelevancies distinguishes polite speaking episodes from Lewisian signalling systems. However, Lewis eventually removes the shared elements from his account. His reason for doing so is put here: Verbal signalling is carried out with some definite end in view, and it is common knowledge what that end is. But this is not the case in general. I do not tell you only what you need to know right now in order to serve our common purposes. Often there is nothing in particular that the audience should do if the communicator has told the truth. The audience should form a belief, perhaps, but that is normally not a voluntary action and hence not an action in conformity to convention....No doubt there is a continuous spectrum from verbal signalling to idle chat, and two-sided and one-sided coordination may be mixed in various proportions. But generality is served by concentrating on the one-sided coordination among communicators, not on the occasional two-sided coordination between a communicator and his audience. (Lewis 1969, p.180) Some explication is needed. Coordination is the solution of a coordination problem. A coordination problem arises when, between two agents, there are multiple courses of action, each equally preferable to the others, but wherein each is preferred only given the other agent pursues the course of action too. One-sided signalling problems arise when communicators are trying to use expressions in the same way as other communicators and nothing else impinges upon their preference for how they use their signals. Two-sided signalling problems arise when communicators and audiences are trying to make the audience's behaviour depend in some way upon the state of affairs in response to which the communicator produces her expressions. Verbal signalling includes two-sided signalling.263 With this background, what is Lewis claiming in this passage? 262 (Lewis 1969, pp.81-82, p.131) 263 (Lewis 1969, pp.141-143) makes verbal signalling compatible with two-sided signalling. But (Lewis 1969, p.180) restricts it to two-sided signalling and is invoking this gloss in the above quotation. 204 Lewis contrasts verbal signalling (so something inclusive of two-sided signalling) with what is ―the case in general.‖ What is often the case, he says, is that there is nothing the audience should do given the communicator has told the truth.264 Lewis supposes that: Bare assertion is a comprehensible practice of ours.265 Let us call this Lewis' assumption. If Lewis' assumption is correct then there is trouble for our use of polite speaking episodes to undermine the justification there is for premise (2) of TIA. For if Lewis' assumption were correct there would be speaking episodes in which successful communication does take place but wherein there is nothing the audience is expected to do with the expressions the speaker produces. But if there is nothing the audience is expected to do in response then there is no particular, if any, semantic calculus within which the hearer will use the expression to reason. And if there is no such calculus there is no calculus for which the speaker has to calibrate her expression for use within. Hence the speaking episode would not constrain the classificatory disposition of the speaker in the way sketched above. Under-determination would remain. 5 Removing the stumbling block When, in good faith, we think through what bare assertion looks like, it must be admitted there is a sheer strangeness to it which is absent from most talk. If a stranger (or even friend) approaches one in the street (or any other location), gets one's attention, and says, with recognisable seriousness while looking into one's eyes, ―the leaves are green,‖ one may understand that an English sentence has been uttered, and even the meanings of the words uttered, but one will not comprehend the utterance in the sense of comprehension with which we are concerned. What exactly counts as being green here? Is the speaker wielding the expression with a classificatory disposition at all? Or is he rather more like the King's Cross drunk who repeats the word ―cake‖ because he likes the sound of it? In such circumstances, if there is something to comprehend at all you will struggle 264 The condition of telling the truth, so not lying and not being incompetent, will be supposed throughout. The speaker says something true, in some sense. What is providing problems is what counts as making the sentence true for the purposes of the conversation. 265 Recall that bare assertion is the practice of uttering a sentence with the sole end of getting a hearer to think something. Also recall that, as we saw at the end of Chapter VI, the doubters adopt Lewis' assumption. 205 to comprehend it. This is an odd thing to do because it is not ordinarily done. Those who say random sentences to random individuals at random times and places are not normal speakers and are of questionable intelligibility.266 Nonetheless one might attempt the following very straightforward defence of Lewis' assumption. One can utter a sentence right here and now and say something comprehensible. For instance, I can say to you right now, ―My flat has just been repainted,‖ and what I said can be clear enough even though there was no intent for it to be employed in any particular stretch of reasoning. It is this phenomenon that best supports Lewis' assumption, one might think. But this quick defence is no such thing. Firstly, what does count as being repainted? Was it merely a touch up of scratches and dents? Was it the outside or the inside? Was it just the windowsills? The whole shebang? Could it just be given a gloss? Etc. You don't know the answers to these questions. You don't even know what exactly counts as being my flat. So it is questionable whether this is really a case of comprehension in the sense with which we are concerned. Secondly, the sentence was given an introduction and bookended from the surrounding text. I said before the sentence, ―For instance,‖ and I separated the sentence from the rest of the text with speech marks. There were also other preliminary remarks which helped frame the sentence as something to be understood as an attempted illustration of a particular point. To understand this point one needs to understand the debate we are currently partaking in. A sentence thus presented is not a case of bare assertion. I have taken great care in how I presented it, constrained as I am by my ends that include being clear in explaining a move in the current discussion. But then it cannot be used in defence of Lewis' assumption because for that we need a genuine case of bare assertion which is assuredly comprehended. Our example meets neither condition. To avoid this problem, we need to consider uses of sentences that are not so framed. A more promising reason to accept Lewis' assumption shows itself in the above quotation when Lewis says, ―there is a continuous spectrum from verbal signalling to idle chat.‖ In this remark he claims there is a spectrum with two ends. On one end there is verbal signalling and on the other is idle chat. Verbal signalling is two-sided coordination: in it hearers are required to make particular 266 (Goffman 1963, Part 3) and (Goffman 1983, pp.32-46) describe the kinds of constraint under which interlocutors' start up talk on what, to whom, and when. 206 uses of the words uttered by speakers. Of the label ―idle chat‖ for the other end of the spectrum, observe the following two things. Firstly, it is clear from what else is said in the passage that that end of the spectrum is occupied by one-sided coordination. Notably, if one-sided coordination of the sort Lewis describes is being pursued then it is bare assertion that is being done. Secondly, once this is noted, we can see that Lewis does not use the expression he could have used to label this end of the spectrum, viz. ―one-sided coordination.‖ He instead uses a non-technical locution. There are kinds of talk which this locution, ―idle chat,‖ is used to speak of: conversation between friends or pleasantries with acquaintances or pub talk.267 Talk of this variety. Perhaps we could generalise and say that this kind of talk is that in which there is no physical labour required in response by the hearer.268 That contrasts with Lewis' example signalling systems. One would have reason to adopt Lewis' assumption if one supposed, as Lewis evidently does, that idle chat just is (a form of) one-sided coordination (and hence, bare assertion). For since idle chat is pervasive, one-sided coordination would be pervasive too. Finally, this kind of talk does not suffer from our ―framing problem‖ because it is naturally occurring talk rather than mid-text example sentences. In describing a single spectrum from verbal signalling to ―idle chat‖ Lewis collapses what might be two different spectra into one spectrum. One spectrum ranges from one-sided signalling to two-sided signalling. The other ranges from speaking episodes which we might call ―idle chat‖ to others in which there is present a physical labour response. Lewis implicitly aligns these spectra like so: One-sided signalling Two-sided signalling Idle chat physical labour responses Suppose that these two spectra were not aligned as Lewis supposes. Then our ordinary talk would not supply reason to think there is comprehensible bare assertion. That there is talk which is idle in some sense and comprehensible would not mean that comprehensible bare assertion is a typical linguistic phenomenon. 267 I am ignoring the elements of such talk which most definitely are polite speaking episodes: e.g. offering someone a drink, buying a drink, etc. 268 By ―physical labour‖ I mean, roughly, the sort of thing that arises in Lewis' own examples. These tend to include some sort of movement of one's body other than one's vocal chords etc. 207 Hence, there would not be the reason there appears to be to accept Lewis' assumption. I am going to argue that Lewis is wrong to align the two spectra: idle chat is not idle in the relevant sense. I will begin by describing two actions that figure in idle chat which are not bare assertions. These are better exemplars than bare assertion for the kind of thing done in idle chat. I argue that these kinds of acts are typical of idle chat in four stages. First I identify pressures to which speakers are sensitive in speaking.269 Second I explain how failing to correctly navigate these pressures is consequential. Third, I describe a phenomenon that arises when one does not know how to navigate such pressures and avoid the consequences of incompetence. Fourth, I explain why if Lewis' assumption were true, this phenomenon should not arise. That it does is reason to reject Lewis' alignment of spectra. We thereby remove what very much appears to be the most obvious reason for accepting Lewis' assumption. 5.1 Two examples of conversational actions: announcing and noticing One does many things in conversation. I will describe two. Neither is bare assertion but each may be confused with it. If these are representative of the kinds of thing one does in idle chat, we can see there are ways to fail to act competently beyond what would be involved in failing to perform a bare assertion. This in turn implies that, in such cases, one is not aiming to perform a bare assertion. Firstly, consider the practice of announcing news. A news announcement is an assertion that presents something as newsworthy and seeks to effect a change of state in the hearer. An announcement of news is something which could be introduced by saying, ―I have news.‖ I want to describe four features of news announcements which indicate what more one is trying to do than say something true and informative. Firstly, it is a striking feature of news announcements that one can often tell what sort of news is going to be offered, and sometimes, even the news exactly. A good explanation of this is that only certain select things count as news, hence if a news announcement is being made, there can only be certain sorts of thing that will be announced (perhaps, by this person, to you). Secondly, 269 The sociologists whose observations I appeal to here employ the same method as Austin. They look for the slips between cup and lip. See for example: (Goffman 1956, p.265), (Garfinkel 1963, p.187), and (Schegloff 2007, p.20). 208 something presented as news can be a basis for admonishing the announcer precisely because it does not qualify as newsworthy (even if it is not already known). It invites the question: ―why are you telling me this?‖ or ―Big deal‖ or something similar.270 When one announces news one seeks to avoid that reaction. So one has to have a sense for what is newsworthy.271 This is also reflected by the fact that we avoid and seek situations in which we will become newsworthy. We know that people talk and what they announce to others and what they will not deem newsworthy and so will not mention. Thirdly, what counts as news depends upon to whom one is speaking. Something that is newsworthy has to be a ― nonordinary' event for [the] particular ethnographic setting‖ of the recipient.272 For example, if two nurses are having an exchange in a hospital corridor, that there was some death in the hospital is not news. Presented as such it would raise a question like, ―why are you telling me this?‖ But clearly, that death would be news to someone even if not the nurses (that question would not be one they will ask).273 Fourthly, there are circles of people who trade in news between themselves so that if something that the group counts as newsworthy happens, then it is expected that it will be something that is announced to other members of the circle. If they do not do so, that can be a negative reflection upon the relationship: People can get annoyed if you don't tell them something that they nonetheless find out; they say ―Well why didn't you tell me?‖ And if you say ―I knew you would hear anyway‖ they nonetheless figure that you were somehow derelict, that you weren't monitoring the world for them as you should. (Sacks 1992a, p.173) Notice that, in particular circumstances, if one is aiming to announce news, and one is doing so competently, there are only certain things one could be doing with one's words. For example, ―a death‖ as in ―there was a death‖ can be operated with many application criteria (for all that the English expression allows).274 Does someone's heart ceasing to beat count as death? Does someone who was taken to be dead by standard procedures but who woke up alive in a morgue count as dead during the time she was thought to be dead? Does someone whose brain is dead but 270 (Sacks 1992a, p.89). See also (Sacks 1992a, p.13). 271 (Sacks 1992, p.68) 272 (Terasaki 2004, p.189) 273 (Terasaki 2004, p.183) 274 Given our earlier argument from Chapter IV. 209 whose heart is beating count as dead? Does someone who has had massive brain damage leading to severe personality changes (e.g. equivalent of a frontal lobotomy) count as dead? If someone is presenting something as news, then, someone has to be speaking of something that is a ― non-ordinary' event for [the] particular ethnographic setting.‖ In given circumstances, operating one's words ―a death‖ in some ways just will not be a way to do that. Someone's heart ceasing to beat for a few moments may be reported as a temporary death by the heart owner when he retells what happened to his friends. It may not be so reported by the surgeon if such an occurrence is not all that unusual for the workaholic surgical team. Generally, if the speaker is being rational (and competent) in making an announcement, there are only certain classificatory dispositions toward the expressions she produces which, in the circumstances of speaking, would mean that by this means she is doing an announcement. Although many ways of operating words are ways of saying truths, they do not qualify as competent news announcements. For that reason the speaking episode will provide severe rational constraints on the classificatory disposition of the speaker when the speaker seeks to do this kind of thing in particular circumstances. A second example of an action that is done in conversation is ―noticing‖ something.275 One may utter an indicative sentence to indicate that one has noticed something in one's surrounding circumstances. One does this in an attempt to get an explanation out of someone for how that is so. Or to share in the oddity of it. But this can only be done if there is something odd about that on which one (apparently) comments. Otherwise it will be difficult for the recipient of the ―noticing‖ to understand what it is one finds noticeable about it. Like newsworthiness, noticeability is not something that everything that is the case and which is not known by one's interlocutor is.276 So if one is uttering a sentence in an attempt to publically notice that something is so, to get an explanation of it from someone, or to share in its oddity, one cannot be using ones words, on that occasion, any way one likes. For instance, suppose I and my interlocutor are walking past the St Pancras hotel and we notice two people lying in the garden outside the restaurant apparently curled up beside one another. One of us might 275 See (Schegloff 1988, p.120) and (Antaki 1994, p.76). 276 It is not unusual to ―notice‖ things of which one's interlocutor was already aware. 210 say, ―They're just lying there.‖ The other can see how that is an odd thing to happen. It is a classy restaurant and there are two people lying on the floor. That is unusual. So then I can see how my friend could be using her words. However, suppose that these individuals are not lying down, they are cleaning between the paving slabs. One could classify these people as ―just lying there.‖ There is nothing about the English words which precludes this. But such a thing would not be something that is noticeable (because, in some way, out of place). So if when I look over to the restaurant I see some guys cleaning the paving slabs I might then be puzzled by my friend's remark, given that it appeared to be her attempting to publically notice something out of the ordinary. Given that I do not count her as naive (as if she never thought anyone would do a job that involved lying on the floor like that) I might then find her remark puzzling. If I then figure, oh wait, they're not cleaning between the paving slabs, they're just sleeping, then I can see that she is actually using ―just lying there‖ somewhat differently than I originally took her to be doing, and then I can see how she is noticing something out of the ordinary. We can describe this in terms of our earlier talk of a semantic calculus. In one case, I cannot see how she is putting her words into a semantic calculus in which that which she says to be so is out of the ordinary. In another I can. If it looks like she is trying to identify something out of the ordinary, I have to know what is ordinary and I have to locate that of which she speaks within it. If I cannot do this, I find her remark puzzling and I struggle to find her action, her attempted noticing, intelligible. 5.2 Conversing competently We have two examples of action in conversation. For competent performance each requires more than is required for bare assertion. I would like to generalise from these examples. In this section I am going to describe two things: firstly, some general pressures one is under when conversing; secondly, consequences of failing to navigate these pressures successfully. These will be employed in the following two sections to support the generalisation. First, the pressures. There is a recognisable shift in one's obligations depending upon whether one is being left alone or instead being addressed by others who are 211 talking. To simply ignore an addresser, for example, is rude.277 If one is addressed (someone says, ―excuse me,‖ or calls one's name) then if one is clearly aware of the summons but one does not react, one cannot not answer it without, in doing that, insulting the summoner.278 Once one is in a state of talk with someone one comes under an obligation to continue to pay attention and respond appropriately to their talk. To give signs that one is not paying attention has a similar effect to ignoring someone's summons when not being able to deny that one is aware of it.279 One cannot leave at just any moment without first flagging-up one's departure unless one wishes to risk insult.280 This is so even though maintaining this poise can resemble an obliged chore.281 One may wish very strongly to leave the engagement and yet one does not do so because of a pressure to leave only at a proper juncture. Furthermore, and most importantly for our purposes, one cannot just speak or respond in any way one could in principle. There is an immense pressure to talk about only things with which one's interlocutor can do something: ...the individual must phrase his own concerns and feelings and interest in such a way as to make these maximally usable by the others as a source of appropriate involvement; and this major obligation of the individual qua interactant is balanced by his right to expect that others present will make some effort to stir up their sympathies and place them at his command. These two tendencies, that of the speaker to scale down his expressions and that of the listeners to scale up their interest, each in the light of the other's capacities and demands, form the bridge that people build to one another, allowing them to meet for a moment of talk in a communion of reciprocally sustained involvement. (Goffman 1957 [1967], pp.116-117) If one fails to do this one risks becoming a bore, insulting, rude, inconsiderate, inept, weird.282 Just as paying attention to another's talk can be a real struggle, so too can saying something with which one's interlocutor can do something. 277 Recall the significance of ―cutting‖ or ―blanking‖ someone. 278 See (Schegloff 1968, e.g. p.1086). If taken to an extreme, as when someone is directly in front of your face and repeatedly trying to get you to respond to whatever they are doing, the result of being unresponsive is not short of an appearance of derangement (Goffman 1963, pp.107-108). For an extended illustration, albeit fictional, see (Canetti 1935 [2000], pp.16-17). 279 (Goffman 1957 [1967], p.126) 280 (Goffman 1963, p.90) 281 (Goffman 1957 [1967], p.115) 282 (Goffman 1955 [1967], pp.37-38) 212 Something might nag at one's mind such as the appearance of one's interlocutor, their past, their sexist tendencies, the time they screwed you over. Or perhaps something about oneself: something is on one's mind that has happened which one cannot stop thinking about. Or one has work to do that one wants to attend to or one has just had an argument with someone which has left a dent in one's attention. Many times when one talks with others one has to wrench one's mind onto something that others will know how to speak about. For example, I remember an occasion on which I attended a drinks reception that followed a talk I had attended. Some of those present at the drinks reception had been present at the talk and some had not. I found myself in the situation of having a three party conversation with one person who was present at the talk and one who wasn't. The one who was present began to ask me questions about it. I instantly said that this was not the place because I knew that the other participant would be unable to participate and would find our discussion hard to follow. This was partly because she was not familiar with the topic of the talk and partly because she just wasn't there. She nonetheless said it was fine and she was interested. So we talked a little about the talk. But within a minute or so the one who had not attended the talk walked away from the exchange, it being clear from her silence and bored facial expression that she had ―lost track‖ of what was being talked about. I had worried that that would happen. And it did. We are aware that this is a prospect. When a newcomer joins a conversation, she can be ―filled in‖ or she can be stranded at the border of the encounter. The prospect of failing to act competently in conversation is a potent influence on our behaviour because failing to do so is consequential for us. If the reader's biographical memory has not alerted the reader to this already, an illustration can be found in the anxiety felt by Harold Garfinkel's students when, as homework, he asked them to go home and have certain kinds of conversation. One assignment required that students pretend not to understand what someone means by a given word. They were to do something when it was not really required, a way of acting less than competently at talk. They were to do this in such a way that those who witnessed it could not ―leave the field‖; that is, they could not interpret what was taking place as a joke or a performance.283 It had to look like the real thing. Many 283 For the locution see (Garfinkel 1963, p.219). 213 students were anxious enough to refuse to do the assignment. We can see why they were apprehensive by looking at two of the exchanges reported by Garfinkel: Case 1: The subject was telling the experimenter, a member of the subject's car pool, about having had a flat tire while going to work the previous day. (S) I had a flat tire. (E) What do you mean, you had a flat tire? She appeared momentarily stunned. Then she answered in a hostile way: ―What do you mean,  What do you mean?' A flat tire is a flat tire. That is what I meant. Nothing special. What a crazy question.!‖ Case 6: The victim waved his hand cheerily. (S) How are you? (E) How am I in regard to what? My health, my finances, my school work, my peace of mind, my...? (S) (Red in the face and suddenly out of control.) Look! I was just trying to be polite. Frankly, I don't give a damn how you are.284 We know that these kinds of response are possible if we fail to be competent in linguistic exchanges. Talking is a delicate matter, even in idle chat. Those who are no good at paying attention, speaking appropriately, and responding appropriately, gain a reputation for being so inclined and we are aware of this. The pressures of etiquette in talk are a potent factor in our linguistic lives because there are consequences for habitually violating them: ...if you come home and report what the grass looked like along the freeway, that there were four noticeable shades of green some of which just appeared yesterday because of the rain, then there may well be a tightening up on the 284 (Garfinkel 1967, pp.42-44) 214 part of your recipient. And if you were to do it routinely, then people might figure that there's something odd about you; that you're pretentious. You might find them jealous of you; you might lose friends. (Sacks 1992a, p.219)285 5.3 The phenomenon of not having anything to say Given what competent conversing involves, and given the risks there are in incompetent conversing, that a familiar kind of situation can arise in an exchange should not be surprising: one does not have anything to say. First dates, forced conversational encounters with colleagues with whom one has nothing in common, family get-togethers for otherwise estranged family members, encounters with those present at a party once one has gone through niceties: each involves bringing together interlocutors who might find it painfully difficult to sustain a conversation, each attempt to do so floundering as the hearer does not know what to do with what the speaker is saying; the speaker struggling to find something to say with which the hearer can become engaged. Someone tells a joke but one cannot see how it is funny.286 Someone remarks upon something she finds interesting but one cannot see what to say in response to it other than a mild acknowledgement, or worse, one thinks that that ought not to be something worth mentioning at all (e.g. comments on the lecturer's figure). In such situations, it is still the case that there is another sense in which one does have something to say. Nothing physically stops one from reporting on any number of things or asking any number of questions. But when one has nothing to say in the more intuitive sense, one has good reason not to try to do such things in the circumstances when those circumstances are correctly describable as ones in which one has nothing to say. What reasons are these? Generally, one knows what would happen if one were to try making certain remarks, ask certain questions and so on, and one does not want what would happen to actually happen.287 Here are some 285 See also (Goffman 1957 [1967], p.135) and (Goffman 1963, pp.143-144). 286 The conversational phenomenon of someone telling a joke, reaching the punch-line but it going unrecognised as such, should be familiar. This is an example of trying to do something and failing in conversation. If one suspects that this will happen, one will not tell the joke. 287 Here are two examples. First: ―A woman was collecting research materials by going into parks with her children and just starting conversations with people. One of the things she reported was how the conversations began. And one recurrent way they began was, there would be a woman sitting on a bench. This woman would go over to the bench with one of 215 examples. One knows that if one jokes about something, which will involve treating something as unserious, and this something turns out to be of serious interest to one's interlocutor then one can insult them by indicating one does not take seriously what they do; one might also end up presenting oneself as unknowing or naive. For example, one might make a joke about the soulessness of working as a consultant, only to discover one's interlocutor and her friends are in fact consultants. One might know that if one mentions a given recent political event that occurred in South America that one's interlocutor will do no more than show minimal acknowledgement. Not knowing the significance of the event, and not wanting you to spend minutes explaining it to them, they cannot think of anything to say about it that would be worth saying. One might know that if one asks someone certain questions they will find it intrusive or rude (e.g. asking after their progress in learning Mandarin may only be condescension at this person's ―substitutes for action‖) and if one asks certain others then they will find one's question boring and not want to persist too far in answering it (e.g. one plays it safe by speaking about the weather). One knows that if one does not talk about the same topic on which she has been speaking for the past two minutes, whilst one has been giving steady acknowledgements to her story, one will in doing that indicate one's lack of interest in what she is saying and in some way upset or insult her. One knows that if one asks a question of which one knows one's interlocutor is highly knowledgeable but which will require some explanation for one to understand the answer, this may be an illegitimate demand to make on one's interlocutor in circumstances in which they are not being paid for the lesson. Generally, when for all the things one can think of saying one can see there is risk of a consequence of the aforementioned sort, none of the options for what one in her children, and sit down. The little boy would wander around for awhile, then he'd come up to her and she'd say,  Go away, I want to sit and rest.' Sometimes he'd go away, but sometimes he'd sit there, annoyingly. And then the other woman would turn to her and say,  They're all like that, aren't they.' And she'd say  Yea' and they'd get into a conversation. I asked her,  Did you ever say no, or something like that?' And she said  Yeah, when I first got out of college I was all full of information. People would say that to me and I'd say  Well I don't know, my kids aren't.' And they'd always stop talking right then and there.'‖ (Sacks 1992, p.25) Second: in the television show Peep Show Mark and Sophie sit in a restaurant. Mark's internal dialogue runs as follows: Oh, my God, we're not saying anything! We've got nothing to say, we've skipped 20 years. We're one of those couples you see. Got to say something. Anything! Then Mark says the following, ―So, w-w-w-what do you think of the... chairs? Quite... OK, aren't they?‖ To which Sophie responds, ―Yeah, they're pretty OK chairs.‖ The tension in the scene is recognisable and no doubt familiar to the reader. There is a definite sense in which Mark is acting incompetently in the situation. 216 some sense could say are really things one can bring oneself to do. So one finds oneself not knowing what to do. One finds oneself not having anything to say even though one may well be obliged to say something because one is in a state of talk with this person. The result is a marked awkwardness. At parties, family gettogethers, and so on, one is engaging in something especially worthy of the title ―idle chat‖ because one is often just ―making conversation.‖ Yet these are the locales in which the kind of work I am describing is most noticeable. An awareness of this can sometimes even be reason enough to avoid the whole occasion.288 5.4 The forgotten work in idle chat Return now to Lewis' assumption. The assumption is implicitly supported by the following line of thought: idle chat is idle in the sense that one engages in bare assertion; idle chat is comprehensible in the specific sense outlined at the beginning of this chapter; hence, bare assertions are comprehensible. Therein lay a trouble for the proposal that it is because speaking episodes are polite that premise (2) of TIA is false. Idle chat is talk whose comprehensibility could not be explained by the politeness of the talk. However, if idle chat encompasses bare assertion then speakers in idle chat aim only to utter sentences which might induce beliefs in one's hearer. Firstly, we have our two examples of conversational action for which this is not so: announcing and noticing.289 Each occurs in idle chat. So these are two respects in which Lewis is mistaken. But furthermore, these are no special cases. If idle chat did allow for bare assertion then we should not expect the phenomenon of not having something to say to arise in most cases in which it does. For in those cases, one can say something in the sense that Lewis describes. One does not fall short of having something to say in those circumstances in the sense that one cannot find a way to do what Lewis proposes is a main preoccupation in idle chat. But one does have nothing to say in these circumstances because despite one's capacity to do these things, one knows what would go wrong if one were to try to do as Lewis suggests. Therefore, Lewis is wrong to suppose that all one is aiming to do, in paradigmatic cases of idle chat, is utter a sentence and for one's hearer (possibly) to form a belief. For if one cannot achieve more than this one would 288 (Goffman 1983, p.32) 289 Other examples can be found in the conversation analytic literature. For an introduction see (Schegloff 2007, chapters 1, 2, 3, and 5). 217 rather refrain from speaking altogether.290 Hence Lewis' alignment of spectra should not be accepted. We would be closer to the truth if we aligned the spectrum from one-sided to two-sided coordination with a spectrum from pathological to normal speaking rather than with a spectrum from idle to physically demanding talk. 5.5 Objections and caveats There are two objections to the argument just given that I will consider and two caveats I will make. The first objection is this. Surely not having something to say is just a case of etiquette and does not affect comprehension (in the sense we are employing). Someone can assert a sentence and say something intelligible even if they are being rude in doing so. There is a difference between ―why are you telling me that?‖ and ―what are you telling me?‖ However, while it is true, there is this difference, I do not need to deny that one can be comprehensibly rude or boring in order to use the pressures we are so clearly guided by in our verbal conduct to show that idle chat is not a case of bare assertion. All that matters is that we are indeed guided by such matters to a tremendous degree: so much so that if we cannot live up to them, sometimes we would sooner not say anything and/or leave then speak and make fools of ourselves. If one wants to persist in claiming that we engage in comprehensible bare assertion, one needs to find examples of that. But idle chat is not a contender if the argument from not having something to say is granted. A second objection is that perhaps speakers just do not want to say anything. If so, then having nothing to say could be explained by Lewis as a circumstance in which someone does not want to say anything even though she could do so quite intelligibly. However, this does not fit well with the awkwardness that accompanies situations in which one needs to say something but one does not have something to say. Unless the speaker enjoys the awkwardness, and I am supposing that most of us do not, the speaker will not want to invite it. So this alternative account has us attributing desires to speakers they do not have. The two caveats are as follows. First, I acknowledge that there may be speaking episodes which are neither polite speaking episodes nor bare assertions, yet in them the hearer understands the speaker. The current argument shows at most 290 I ignore, what now seems to be so, that the hearer may not know what belief to form if she cannot discern what more the speaker is doing beyond what Lewis proposes. 218 that we do not engage in bare assertion (typically in idle chat). But that does not mean we are engaging in polite speaking whenever comprehensible. The aim of the above argument was only to undermine one tempting justification for denying that one can respond to the incompatibility argument in the way I have proposed. The second caveat is that the appeal to questions of conversational etiquette may be somehow Euro-centric and so not culturally general. Perhaps there are societies in which there are so few constraints on how, when, and on what interlocutors speak to one another that they plausibly engage in bare assertion. Perhaps in such societies comprehension is perfectly feasible. If examples of this were found then the current argument would need amendment. 6 Summary I have presented a kind of end which, if a speaker pursues it in rich enough circumstances, places rational constraints on her classificatory disposition toward the sentences she utters. This provides us with material to discredit the gloss on the speaking episode that gave credence to premise (2) of TIA and thus a basis on which to challenge Stenius' attitude. I also sought to meet a challenge posed against this strategy. The strategy commits us to the claim that there are no comprehensible impolite speaking episodes. This claim faces ―the stumbling block‖: apparently, we engage in a practice of comprehensible bare assertion. If it were accurate to align idle chat with bare assertion then everyday life would furnish us with easy counterexamples the claim to which we are committed. I have argued that that alignment cannot be accurate because if it were then the phenomenon of not having anything to say would not exist (in idle chat). That it does exist indicates that speakers are guided therein by more pressures than they would if bare assertion were a practice of theirs. By undermining this alignment, our response to TIA gains a prima facie plausibility which it would otherwise lack. Admittedly, this is not altogether satisfactory. It would have been better if I could have provided an argument or observation which shows that there are no comprehensible impolite speaking episodes. I suspect the formulation of such an argument would require a study of ordinary talk of a shape I am not yet certain. This will have to remain work for the future. 219 Conclusion We first began our discussion with the simple model of communication. We noted that within that model, OS seems to be without an occupation and at risk of sabotaging the work done by other properties we know words (at least on occasion) to possess. Although the simple model of communication is not incorrect, it is an abstraction. No real communicative exchange is as bare bones as the model would suggest. Everyone knows that. But it is easy to suppose that the elements of that model operate, and hence can be understood, autonomously from what has been omitted. This easy supposition should not be made. In order for a language to enable valid (in application) reasoning there must be, built into the language, application criteria for expressions which form noncontingently balanced arrays. But there are no such arrays. So reasoning done with a prefabricated language will be invalid (in application). So what I called ―calibration‖ is required upon use of the expressions of the language. This gives us reason to doubt, and I think, reject the hypothesis. A consequence is that communication cannot be effected by pre-learnt determinate rules relating words and substantial extensions. This induces the worry that OS, understood in the setup of the simple model, undermines the possibility of communication. However, the very reason why speakers face the chore of calibration doubles up as an explanation of how Stenius' attitude can be mistaken. A speaker who aims to produce words with which to reason in an identifiable semantic calculus needs to operate those words in certain ways. Provided that she so aims in rich enough circumstances, she will as a rational speaker operate those 220 words only in those certain ways. A hearer who understands this can use this fact to become aware of the substantial extensions of the speaker's words. One may feel uneasy at so much reliance upon rational constraints. To (begin to) address this I have provided reminders of just how rich a socialized talker's circumstances usually are. A Quinean landscape may well provide only material pressures on inhabiting talkers; too few to make their utterances comprehensible to their fellow inhabitants. But a Goffmanian landscape is laced with ―a vast filigree of trip wires which individuals are uniquely equipped to trip.‖291 Once reminded of this, it is not so farfetched to suppose that it is because interlocutors are motivated ―to preserve everyone's face,‖ when at risk of acting incompetently at talk, that ―they then end up acting so as to preserve orderly communication.‖292 If this is at all correct, there is an interesting implication. If progress is to be made on lexical semantics (as contrasted with compositional (i.e. logico-syntactic) semantics) then one would do better to conduct micro-sociological studies of particular speakers, in particular places, pursuing particular projects, with particular methods, than one would looking at psychological studies riddled as they are with their own variant of the hypothesis at the level of ―information‖ to be processed. A psychological theory, as we find in psychological further factor views that maintain the hypothesis, attempts to identify general ways that human thinkers do things. A micro-sociological study respects the idiosyncrasies of time and place, the materials with which talkers work their craft. I close by acknowledging an absence from the foregoing discussion. I have not addressed the use of written words in the form of books and newspapers and other mass produced items used for communication. I do not think I need to hold a different view of written from spoken words. When Cappelen and Lepore claim that if ―radical contextualism‖ were true, it would be miraculous if two different readers understood their book in the same way, it is worth bearing in mind two things.293 The first is that very few people have and will ever read their book. Only those with an immensely rich shared education and who have an awareness of the debates to which that book is intended as a contribution will read it. It is as part of the network of issues that are alive in that debate that the book will be understood. 291 (Goffman 1971, p.106) 292 (Goffman 1976 [1981], p.19) 293 (Cappelen and Lepore 2005, pp.126-127) 221 The second is that, it is far from obvious that everyone does agree on what the book says (at least not on first reading). The same possibilities for multiple readings are available for words used in writing and the same motives arise for calibration, and calibrating for use by someone else, as we find with spoken words. 222 References Anscombe, Elizabeth.

Or that you are a postal clerk dividing envelopes into bundles; or a laboratory technician sorting samples of bacteria into species and subspecies. Or imagine that you are making a list of the fossils in your museum, or of the guests in your hotel on a certain night. In each of these cases you are employing a certain grid of labeled cells, and you are recognizing certain objects as being located in those cells. Such a grid of labeled cells is an example of what we shall call a granular partition. We shall argue that granular partitions are involved in all naming, listing, sorting, counting, cataloguing and mapping activities. Division into units, counting and parceling out, mapping, listing, sorting, pigeonholing, cataloguing are activities performed by human beings in their traffic with the world. Partitions are the cognitive devices designed and built by human beings to fulfill these various listing, mapping and classifying purposes. In almost all current work in areas such as common-sense reasoning and natural language semantics it is the naıve portion of set theory that is used as basic framework. The theory of granular partitions as it is developed in this paper is intended to serve as an alternative to set theory both as a tool of formal ontology and as a framework for the representation of human cognition. Kinds, sorts, species and genera are standardly treated as sets of their instances; subkinds as subsets of these sets. Set theory nicely does justice to the granularity that is involved in our sorting and classification of reality by giving us a means of treating objects as elements of sets, i.e. as single whole units within which further parts are not recognized. But set theory also has its problems, not the least of which is that it supports no distinction between natural totalities (such as the species cat) and such ad hoc totalities as, for example, \u0000 the moon, Napoleon, justice \u0001 . Set theory has problems, too, when it comes to dealing with time, and with the fact that biological species and similar entities may remain the same even when there is a turnover in their instances. For sets are identical if and only if they have the same members. If we model the species cat as the set of its instances, then this means that cats form a different species every time a cat is born or dies. If, similarly, we identify an organism as the set of 1 from Foundations of Geographic Information Science, M. Duckham, M. F. Goodchild and M. F. Worboys (eds.), London: Taylor & Francis, 2003, 117–151 2 Foundations of Geographical Information Science its cells, then this means that it becomes a different organism whenever cells are gained or lost. Set theory has problems also when it comes to dealing with the relations between granularities. An organism is a totality of cells, but it is also a totality of molecules, and it is also a totality of atoms. Yet the corresponding sets are distinct, since they have distinct members. More recently, attempts have been made to solve some of these problems by using mereology or the theory of part and whole relations (Smith, 1998) as a framework for ontological theorizing. Mereology is better able to do justice in realistic fashion to the relations between wholes and their constituent parts at distinct levels of granularity. All the above-mentioned totalities (of cells, molecules, atoms) are, when treated mereologically, one and the same. Mereology also has the advantage over set theory when it comes to serving as a tool for the sort of middle-level ontological theorizing which the study of common-sense reasoning requires. For mereology does not require that, in order to quantify over wholes of given sorts, one must first of all specify some level of ultimate parts (the Urelemente of set theory) from out of which all higher-level entities are then constructed. But mereology, too, has its problems. Thus it, too, has no way it has no way of dealing with entities which gain and lose parts over time and it has no way of distinguishing intrinsically unified wholes from ad hoc aggregations. Above all, its machinery for coping with the phenomenon of granularity brings problems of its own, for if we quantify over wholes, in a mereological framework, then we thereby quantify over all the parts of such wholes, at all levels of granularity. The selectivity of intentionality means however that we are often directed cognitively to coarse-grained wholes whose finer-grained parts are traced over: when I think of Mary I do not think of all the molecules in Mary's arm. Mereology has no means of mimicking the advantages of set-theory when it comes to dealing with such phenomena, and it is no small part of our project here to rectify this defect. The theory of granular partitions is the product of an effort to build a more realistic, and also a more general and flexible, framework embodying the strengths of both set theory and mereology while at the same time avoiding their respective weaknesses. 2 TYPES OF GRANULAR PARTITIONS Some types of granular partitions are flat: they amount to nothing more than a mere list. Others are hierarchical: they consist of cells and subcells, the latter being nested within the former. Some partitions are built in order to reflect independently existing divisions on the side of objects in the world (the subdivision of hadrons into baryons and mesons, the subdivision of quarks into up, down, top, bottom, charm, strange). Other partitions-for example the partitions created by nightclub doormen or electoral redistricting commissions-are themselves such as to create the corresponding divisions on the side of their objects, and sometimes they create those very objects themselves. Quite different sorts of partitions-having cells of different resolutions and effecting unifyings and slicings and reapportionings of different types-can be applied simultaneously to the same domain of objects. The people in your building can be divided according to gender, social class or social security number. Or they can be divided according to tax bracket, A Theory of Granular Partitions 3 blood type, current location or Erdös number. Maps, too, can impose subdivisions of different types upon the same domain of spatial reality, and the icons which they employ represent objects in granular fashion (which means that they do not represent the corresponding object parts). Maps will turn out to be important examples of granular partitions in the sense intended here. The theory of partitions is, as will by now be clear, highly general, and this generality brings with it a correspondingly highly general reading of the term 'object'. Here we take an object to be any portion of reality: an individual, a part of an individual, a class of individuals (for example a biological species), a spatial region, a political unit (county, polling district, nation), or even (for present purposes) the universe as a whole. An object in the partition-theoretic sense is everything (existent) that can be recognized by some cell of a partition. Objects can be either of the bona fide or of the fiat sort (Smith, 2001a). Bona fide objects, for example the moon, your armchair, this piece of cheese, are objects which exist (and are demarcated from their surroundings) independently of human partitioning activity. Fiat objects are objects which exist (and are demarcated from their surroundings) only because of such partitioning activity. Examples are: census tracts, your right arm, the Western Hemisphere. In some cases partition cells recognize pre-existing fiat objects, in other cases the latter are created through the very projection of partition cells onto a corresponding portion of reality. Examples are the partitions creating the States of Wyoming and Montana, or the partitions of a population into persons belonging to distinct tax brackets created by tax legislation. Once fiat objects have been created in this way subsequent partitions may simply recognize them (without any object-creating effect), just as there are partitions which simply recognize bona fide objects.. Our notion of granular partition is only distantly related to the more familiar notion of a partition defined in terms of equivalence classes. Our partitions can include more structure in the form of hierarchically arranged subcells and supercells. Moreover, it is possible to define a partition in terms of an equivalence relation only where the relevant domain has already been divided up into units (the elements of the set with which we begin). The very process of division into units-for example through the imposition of fiat subdivisions or fiat discretizations upon continuous gradations-is however one of the things which our present theory is designed to illuminate. In Smith and Brogaard (2002b) the notion of granular partition was introduced as a generalization of David Lewis's (1991) conception of classes as the mereological sums of their constituent singletons. Granular partitions, too, can in first approximation be conceived as the mereological sums of their constituent cells. The cells within a granular partition may however manifest a range of properties which the singletons of set theory lack. This is because, where a singleton is defined in the obvious way in terms of its member, each cell of a granular partition is defined by its label, and this means: independently of any object which might fall within it. The cells of a partition are what they are independently of whether there are objects located within them. A map of Middle Earth is different from a map of the Kingdom of Zenda, even though there is in both cases precisely nothing on the side of reality upon which these maps would be projected. 'The Morning Star' and 'The Evening Star' were for a long time used as labels for two distinct 4 Foundations of Geographical Information Science cells in astronomers' partitions of the heavenly bodies, even though, as it later turned out, it is one the same object that is located in each. If one thinks that there are dodos, then one makes a different sort of error from the error which one makes if one thinks that there is an intra-Mercurial planet. (Set theory, it almost goes without saying, lacks the machinery to deal with such different sorts of error.) Just as when we point our telescope in a certain direction we may fail to find what we are looking for, so when we point our partition in a certain direction it may be that there are no objects located in its cells. There may, in this sense, be empty cells within a partition (and even, in the most general version of our theory, partitions all of whose cells are empty). But this does not mean that the theory of partitions recognizes some counterpart of the set theorist's empty set (an entity that is contained as a subset within every set). For the empty set is empty by necessity; a cell in a partition, in contrast, is at best empty per accidens; it is empty because of some failure on our part in our attempts to partition the reality beyond. The theory of partitions is thus more powerful than set theory, in that it is better able to do justice to the various ways in which human beings are related, cognitively, to objects in reality. In many ways, however, partition theory is also much weaker than set theory. For the axioms of set theory imply the existence of an entire hierarchy of sets, sets of sets, and so on, ad infinitum, reflecting the fact that they were designed to yield an instrument of considerable mathematical power. Partition theory, in contrast, is like mereology in that it is attuned to purposes other than those of mathematics. More specifically, it is designed to do justice to the sometimes ad hoc ways in which cognitive classificatory instruments are constructed by human beings for specific human purposes. Partition theory differs from set theory also in this: that it puts partitions and objects in two entirely separate realms. Partitions themselves are never objects, and there are no partitions of partitions. Thus partition theory has no counterpart of sets of sets or of the distinction between two ways in which one set can be contained within another (on the one hand as element, on the other hand as subset). Partition theory can thus provide a framework for theorizing about the relations between cognitive artifacts such as lists and maps and the reality to which such artifacts relate in such a way that debates for example concerning the status of the hierarchy of transfinite sets can be avoided. 3 GRANULAR PARTITIONS AS SYSTEM OF CELLS 3.1 A bipartite theory In the present paper we present the basic formal theory of granular partitions, leaving for a later work the presentation of the theory of cell-labeling (and, more generally, of the cognitive aspects of partitions as we here understand them). Our formal theory has two orthogonal and independent parts: (A) a theory of the relations between cells, subcells, and the partitions in which they are contained; (B) a theory of the relations between partitions and objects in reality. The counterpart of (A) in a set-theoretic context would be the study of the relations among subsets of a single set; the counterpart of (B) would be the study of the relations between sets and their members. These set-theoretical counterparts of (A) and (B) are, be it noted, not independent. This is because the standard subset relation of set theory is itself defined in terms of the set-membership relation ( \u0000 is a subset A Theory of Granular Partitions 5 of \u0000 means: all the members of \u0000 are members of \u0000 ). In the context of partition theory, in contrast, the corresponding relations are defined independently of each other. Partition theory thus departs from the extensionalism of set theory (i.e. from the assumption that each set is defined exclusively by its members). A cell is defined by its position within a partition and by its relations to other cells, and it is this which gives rise to the relations treated of by theory (A). What objects in reality are located in a cell-the matter of theory (B) -is then a further question, which is answered, in different ways from case to case. Briefly, we can think of cells as being projected onto objects in something like the way in which flashlights are projected upon the objects which fall within their purview. Consider the left part of Figure 1. Theory A governs the way we organize cells into nesting structures and the way we label cells. Theory B governs the way these cellstructures project onto reality indicated by the arrows connecting the left and the right parts of the Figure. Our strategy in what follows will be first of all to define a series of master conditions belonging to theory (A) and theory (B) respectively, and which-for the purposes of the present paper-all partitions will be assumed to satisfy. In later sections we will add further conditions, satisfied by some partitions but not by others. Figure 1: Relationships between cells and objects 3.2 The subcell relation Theory (A) is effectively a theory of well-formedness for partitions; it studies properties partitions have in virtue of the relations between and the operations performed upon the cells from out of which they are built, independently of any linkage to reality beyond. Cells in partitions may be nested one inside another in the way in which, for example, the species crow is nested inside the species bird, which in turn is nested inside the genus vertebrate in standard biological taxonomies. When one cell is nested inside another in this way we say that the former is a sub-cell of the latter. Note that the subcell relation can hold between two cells independently of whether there are any objects located in them (as for example in relation to the cells labeled 'male dodos' and 'dodos' in a classification of extinct animals). 6 Foundations of Geographical Information Science We use \u0000\u0002\u0001\u0003\u0000\u0005\u0004\u0006\u0001\u0003\u0000\u0006\u0007\u0005\u0001\t\b \b\u000b\b as variables ranging over cells and \u0001 \u0004\u0005\u0001 \u0007\u0005\u0001\t\b \b \b as variables ranging over partitions ('cell' is 'Zelle', partition is 'Aufteilung' in German). We write \u0000\u0005\u0004\u000e \u0010\u000f\u0011\u0000\u0012\u0007 in order to express the fact that \u0000\u0013\u0004 stands in a sub-cell relation to \u0000\u0014\u0007 within the partition . (Where confusion will not result we will drop the explicit reference to the partition and write simply ' '). We can then state the first of several master conditions on all partitions as follows: MA1: The subcell relation is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. This means that within every partition: each cell is a subcell of itself; if two cells are subcells of each other then they are identical; and if cell \u0000 \u0004 is a sub-cell of \u0000 \u0007 and \u0000 \u0007 a sub-cell of \u0000\u0012\u0015 , then \u0000\u0005\u0004 is in its turn a sub-cell of \u0000\u0014\u0015 . We can think of the sub-cells of a cell within a given partition as special sorts of parts of the cell; they are those parts which are included within this same partition as cells in their own right. 3.3 Existence of a maximal cell We define a maximal cell of a partition as a cell satisfying: DMax: \u0016\u0018\u0017\u0019\u0000 \u0004 \u0001 \u001b\u001a \u0017 \u0000 \u0004 \u0001 !\u001a#\"\u0013$\u0002%\u000e& \u0000(' \u0017 \u0000\u0002\u0001 \u001b\u001a*) \u0000+ ,\u0000 \u0004 . Here ' \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 \u001b\u001a ' means that \u0000 is a cell in the partition . (Again: we shall normally omit the condition \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 !\u001a where confusion will not result.) We now demand as a further master condition that MA2: Every partition has a unique maximal cell in the sense of DMax. The motivation for MA2 is very simple: it turns on the fact that a partition with two maximal cells would either be in need of completion by some extra cell representing the result of combining these two maximal cells together into some larger whole; or it would not be one partition at all, but rather two separate partitions, each of which would need to be treated in its own right within the framework of our theory. We also call the unique maximal cell of a partition its root, ./\u0017 \u001b\u001a . The maximal cell of a partition is such that all the cells in the partition are included in it as subcells. MA2 implies that there are no partitions which are empty tout court in that they have no cells at all. 3.4 Finite chain condition The transitivity of generates a nestedness of cells inside a partition in the form of chains of cells satisfying \u0000\u0013\u0004\u000e01\u0000\u0012\u0007203\b\u000b\b \b401\u0000\u00065 , with \u0000\u0005\u0004 as root. We shall call the cells at the ends of such chains minimal cells or leaves, and define: DMin: 687:9;\u0017 \u0000\u0005\u0004\u0014\u0001 \u001b\u001a*\u001c< \u0017 \u0000\u0005\u0004\u0006\u0001 !\u001a=\"\u0013$\u0002%!& \u0000+' \u0017 \u0000\u0002\u0001 \u001b\u001a>) \u0017 \u0000+ ?\u0000\u0005\u0004 ) \u00002@A\u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a Another important aspect of a partition is then: MA3: Each cell in a partition is connected to the root via a finite chain of immediate succeeding cells. A Theory of Granular Partitions 7 A cell \u0000\u0012\u0007 is the immediate successor of the cell \u0000 \u0004 if and only if \u0000\u0005\u0004+ \u0000\u0012\u0007 and there does not exist a cell \u0000\u0014\u0015 such that \u0000\u0013\u0004 \u0001 \u0000\u0012\u0015 \u0001 \u0000\u0012\u0007 holds. MA3 does not rule out the possibility that a given cell within a partition might have infinitely many immediate subcells (also called daughter cells). Enforcing finite chains thus leaves open the issue as to whether partitions themselves are finite. If, in counting off the cars passing beneath you on the highway, your checklist includes one cell labeled red cars and another cell labeled Chevrolets, we will rightly feel that there is something amiss with your partition. One problem is that you will almost certainly be guilty of double counting. Another problem is that there is no natural relationship between these two cells, which seem rather to belong to distinct partitions. As a step towards rectifying such problems we shall insist that all partitions must satisfy a condition according to which every pair of distinct cells within a partition stand to each other either in the subcell relation or in the relation of disjointness. In other words: MA4: If two cells within a partition overlap, then one is a subcell of the other. Or in symbols: \u0002 \u0000+'\u0002\u0017 \u0000 \u0000\u0005\u0004 \"\u0005$\u0002% \u0000+ ?\u0000\u0012\u0007 \u001a\u001d) \u0000\u0014\u0004\u001b ?\u0000\u0012\u0007\u0004\u0003\u0006\u0005 \u0000\u0005\u0004\u001b0 \u0000\u0012\u0007 . (Here and in what follows initial universal quantifiers are taken as understood.) From MA3 and MA4 we can prove by a simple reductio that the chain connecting each cell of a partition to the root is unique. 3.5 Partition-theoretic sum and product of cells The background to all our remarks in this paper is mereology. We take the relation \u0007 meaning 'part of' as primitive, and define the relation of overlap between two entities simply as the sharing of some common part. \u0007 is like in being reflexive, anti-symmetric and transitive, but the two differ in the fact that is a very special case of \u0007 . The subcells of a cell are also parts of the cell (just as, for David Lewis, 1991, each singleton is a part of all the sets in which it is included). What happens when we take the mereological products and sums of cells existing within a partition? In regard to the mereological product, \u0000\u0013\u0004 \b \u0000\u0012\u0007 , of two cells matters are rather simple. This product exists only when the cells overlap mereologically, i.e. only when they have at least one subcell in common. This means that the mereological product or intersection of two cells, if it exists, is in every case just the smaller of the two cells. In regard to the mereological sum of cells \u0000 \u0004 \u0000\u0012\u0007 , in contrast, it is a more difficult situation which confronts us. Given any pair of cells within a given partition, the corresponding mereological sum does indeed exist-simply in virtue of the fact that the axioms of mereology allow unrestricted sum-formation. (This is a trivial matter, for the mereologist: if you got the parts, whatever they are, then you got the whole.) But only in special cases will this mereological sum be itself a cell within the partition in question. This occurs for example when cells labeled 'male rabbit' and 'female rabbit' within a partition have as their sum the cell labeled 'rabbit'. There is, in contrast, no cell in our standard biological partition of the animal kingdom labeled rabbits and jellyfish, and there is no cell in our standard geopolitical partition of the surface of the globe labeled Hong Kong and Algeria. 8 Foundations of Geographical Information Science To make sense of these matters we need to distinguish the mereological sum of two cells from what we might call their partition-theoretic sum. We can define the former as just the result of taking the two cells together in our thoughts and treating the result as a whole. We can define the latter as follows. The partition-theoretic sum \u0000 \u0004\u0001\u0000 \u0000 \u0007 of two cells in a partition is the smallest subcell within the partition containing both, \u0000 \u0004 and \u0000 \u0007 , as subcells; i.e., it is the least upper bound of \u0000 \u0004 and \u0000 \u0007 with respect to . (By MA2 and MA4 we know that this is always defined and that it is unique.) This partition-theoretic sum is in general distinct from the mereological sum of the corresponding cells. (The partition-theoretic sum of the cells labeled rabbit and lion is the cell labeled mammal in our partition of the animal kingdom.) The best we can say in general is that \u0000 \u0004 \u0000\u0012\u0007 is at least part of \u0000\u0005\u0004 \u0000 \u0000\u0012\u0007 (Smith, 1991). Note, on the other hand, that if we analogously define the partition-theoretic product, \u0000 @\u0018\u0000 \u0004\u0003\u0002 \u0000\u0012\u0007 , of two cells within a given partition as the largest subcell shared in common by \u0000\u0013\u0004 and \u0000\u0012\u0007 , i.e., as their greatest lower bound with respect to , then it turns out that this coincides with the mereological product already defined above. Mereological sum and product apply to both cells and objects; partition-theoretic sum applies only to cells. Here we use the symbols for the two groups of relations as shown in Table 1: Partition-theoretic (for cells) Mereological (for cells and for objects) Sum \u0000 Product \u0002 \b Inclusion \u0007 Proper Inclusion \u0001 \u0004 Table 1: Partition-theoretic and mereological relations and operations. When restricted to cells within a given partition and \u0007 coincide, and so also do \u0002 and \b . We can think of as the result of restricting \u0007 to the natural units picked out by the partition in question. We can think of set theory as amounting to the abandonment of the idea that there is a distinction between natural units and arbitrary unions. Set theory, indeed, derives all its power from this abandonment. 3.6 Trees Philosophers since Aristotle have recognized that the results of our sorting and classifying activities can be represented as those sorts of branching structures which mathematicians nowadays called trees. Trees are directed graphs without cycles. They consist of nodes or vertices and of directed edges that connect the nodes. That the edges are directed means that the vertices connected by an edge are related to each other in a way that is analogous to an ordered pair. Here we are interested specifically in rooted trees, which is to say: trees with a single topmost node to which all other vertices are connected, either directly or indirectly, via edges. In a rooted tree, every pair of vertices is connected by one and only one chain (or sequence of edges). We shall think of the directedness of an edge as A Theory of Granular Partitions 9 proceeding down the tree from top to bottom (from ancestors to descendants). That a tree is without cycles means that, if we move along its edges, then we will always move down the tree and in such a way that, however far we travel, we will never return to the point from which we started. The connection between partitions and trees will now be obvious: it is a simple matter to show that every finite partition can be represented as a rooted tree of finite depths and vice versa (Mark, 1978). To construct a tree from a finite partition we create a graph by mapping the cells \u0000\u0001\u0000 of the partition onto nodes \u0002\u0003\u0000 within the graph and by introducing a directed edge from vertex \u0002\u0003\u0000 to \u0002\u0005\u0004 if and only if the cell \u0000\u0006\u0000 has cell \u0000\u0007\u0004 as an immediate subcell. That this is always possible follows from the fact that the subcell relation is well defined (by MA1) and from the fact that chains of immediate cells are always finite (MA3). We can easily show also that the resulting graph is a rooted tree, which follows from MA2; that the graph structure is connected (from MA2), and acyclical (from MA4); and that there is a unique path between any two vertexes (from MA2, MA3 and MA4). The complementary reconstruction of a partition from its tree representation is no less trivial. We can represent a partition not only as a tree but also as a simple sort of Venn diagram. In a Venn diagram partition cells are represented as topologically simple and regular regions of the plane. Our partitions are Venn diagrams within which regions do not intersect. (Conversely every array of non-intersecting, possibly nested regions in the plain can be transformed into a tree in such a way that each region is represented by a node in the tree, and each directed link in the tree represents an immediately contains relation between a corresponding pair of nested regions.) In the remainder we will often think of partitions as such planar maps (that is as Venn diagrams without overlapping), and the minimal cells correspond to the smallest regions within such diagrams. Tree and Venn-diagram representations of granular partitions are not equivalent. To see this consider Figure 2. Even if we ignore the labeling it is obvious that the two Venn-diagrams represent two distinct partitions. The mammal-partition contains 'empty space' and the first-couple-partition is full in the sense that it does not contain 'empty space'. This distinction, however, can not be made in terms of the corresponding tree representations. In order to represent it in the tree we needed consider labeled trees with nodes labeled full or not-full. We will discuss these issues in more detail in our section on fullness and cumulativeness of granular partitions. George W.

They are constructed to serve as inventories or pictures or maps of specific portions of reality, and in this they are analogous to windows, or to the latticed grills purported to have been used by Renaissance artists as aids to the faithful representation of objects in reality (Smith, 2001b). They are analogous also to propositions (Elementarsätze) as described by Wittgenstein in the Tractatus (1961). A proposition, for Wittgenstein, is built out of simple signs (names) arranged in a certain order. Each name, Wittgenstein tells us, stands in a projective relation to a corresponding object in the world: it cannot fail to strike its target. If a proposition is true, then its simple signs stand to each other within the proposition as the corresponding objects stand to each other in the world. It is in this sense that a true atomic proposition is a picture, as Wittgenstein puts it, of a state of affairs in reality. That a proposition is a complex of names arranged in a certain order is in our present context equivalent to the thesis that a partition is a complex of cells arranged in a certain order. A partition is a complex of cells in its projective relation to the world (compare Tractatus, 3.12). This relation may be effected either directly by the user of the partition-for example in looking through the cells of the grid and recording what objects are detected on the other side-or indirectly, with the help of proper names or other referring devices such as systems of coordinates or taxonomic labels. For Wittgenstein it is guaranteed a priori for every name that there is some unique object onto which the name is projected. From the perspective of the theory of granular partitions, in contrast, projection may fail. That is, a partition may be such that-like the partition cataloguing Aztec gods-there are no objects for its cells to project onto. Works of fiction and also not yet realized plans may be conceived as involving partitions of this kind. In this paper, however, we are interested primarily in partitions which do not project out into thin air in this way. We write ' \u0000 \u0017 \u0000\u0002\u0001\u0002\u0001 \u001a ' as an abbreviation for: cell \u0000 is projected onto object \u0001 . We can also, if the context requires it, write ' \u0000*\u000f \u0017 \u0000\u0002\u0001\u0002\u0001 \u001a ' to indicate that the projection of \u0000 onto \u0001 obtains in the context of partition . In what follows we shall assume that a unique such projection is defined for each partition. In a more general theory we can weaken this assumption, for example by allowing projections to vary with time while the partition remains fixed (Smith and Brogaard, 2002a). Such variation of projection for a fixed partition is involved in all sampling activity. Consider, for example, what happens when we use a territorial grid of cells to map the presence of one or more birds of given species in given areas from one moment to the next. 4.2 Location If projection is successful, then the object upon which a cell is projected is located in that cell. The use of the term 'location' reflects the fact that one important inspiration of our work is the study of location relations in spatial contexts. One motivating example of a location relation within our theory is the relation between a spatial object such as a A Theory of Granular Partitions 11 railway station and an icon on a map. Other motivating examples are of a non-spatial sort: they include the relation between an instance (Tibbles) and its kind (cat) or the relation between a customer and the corresponding record in a database. Indeed they include the relation between you and your name. We can compare a partition with a rig of spotlights projecting down onto an orchestra during the performance of a symphony. Each cell of the partition corresponds to some spotlight in the rig. Some cells (spotlights) will project upon single players, others onto whole sections of the orchestra (string, wind, percussion, and so forth). One cell (spotlight) will project upon the orchestra as a whole. Note that the spotlights do not hereby create the objects which they cast into relief. When once the rig has been set, and the members of the orchestra have taken their places, then it will be an entirely objective matter which objects (individuals and groups of individuals) are located in which illuminated cells. In what follows we make the simplifying assumption that objects are exactly located at their cells (that spotlights never partially illuminate single players or sections). Compare the way in which Wyoming is exactly located at the cell 'Wyoming' in the partition of the US into States or the way in which your brother Norse is exactly located at the cell 'Norse' in your partition (list) of your family members. In a more general theory we liberalize the location relation in such a way as to allow also for partial or rough location (Casati and Varzi, 1995; Bittner and Stell, 1998). 4.3 Transparency When projection succeeds, then location is what results. Projection and location thus correspond to the two directions of fit-from mind to world and from world to mind- between an assertion and the corresponding truthmaking portion of reality (Searle, 1983; Smith, 1999). Projection is like the relation which holds between your shopping list and the items which, if your shopping trip is successful, you will actually buy. Location is like the relation which obtains between the items you have bought and the new list your mother makes after your return, as she checks off those items which you have in fact succeeded in bringing back with you. The formula ' \u0000 \u0017 \u0001/\u0001\u0003\u0000 \u001a ' abbreviates: object \u0001 is located at cell \u0000 . (And again where this is required we can write ' \u0000 \u000f \u0017 \u0001/\u0001\u0003\u0000 \u001a ' for: \u0001 is located at \u0000 in partition .) Location presupposes projection: an object is never located in a cell unless the object has already been picked out as the target of the projection relation associated with the relevant partition. But successful projection-by which is meant the obtaining of the projection relation between a cell and an object-also presupposes location, so that where both \u0000 and \u0000 obtain they are simply the converse relations of each other. We have now reached the point where we can formulate the first of our master conditions on partitions from the perspective of theory (B): MB1: \u0000 \u0017 \u0001/\u0001\u0003\u0000 \u001a*) \u0000 \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 \u0001 \u001a MB2: \u0000 \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 \u0001 \u001a*) \u0000\u001b\u0017 \u0001/\u0001 \u0000 \u001a (Successful) projection and (successful) location are simple converses of each other. (We formulate this principle as two separate conditions in order to leave room for a more general theory in which these two relations are teased apart.) 12 Foundations of Geographical Information Science MB1 and MB2 tell us that a partition projects a given cell onto a given object if and only if that object is located in the corresponding cell. Very many partitions-from automobile component catalogues to our maps of states and nations-have this quality without further ado. We shall call partitions which satisfy MB1 and MB2 transparent partitions, a notion which we can define in the obvious way as follows: DTr: \u0000\u0002\u0001 \u0017 !\u001a*\u001c?& \u0000 & \u0001 ' \u0000 \u000f \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 \u0001 \u001a\u0004\u0003 \u0000 \u000f \u0017 \u0001/\u0001 \u0000 \u001a MB1 and MB2 jointly ensure that objects are actually located at the cells that project onto them. Notice however that a transparent partition, according to our definition, may still have empty cells. Such cells may for example be needed in the context of scientific partitions in order to leave room for what, on the side of the objects, may be discovered in the future. (Compare the cells labeled Ununnilium, Unununium and Ununbium in the Periodic Table of the Elements.) Empty cells may similarly be needed to cover up for temporary lapses in memory. You are attempting to account for the people at your party last night. Your partition consists of six cells labeled: John, Mary, Phil, Chris, Sally, and anyone else (for people you might have forgotten). Assume that John, Mary, Phil, Chris and Sally is a complete listing of all the people at the party. Your anyone else cell is then empty. 4.4 Functionality constraints (constraints pertaining to correspondence to objects) 4.4.1 Projection is functional: the confused schoolboy The property of transparency is still rather weak. Thus transparency is consistent with ambiguity on the side of the cells in relation to the objects they target, that is with the case where one cell projects onto two distinct objects. An example of the sort of problem we have in mind is the partition created by a lazy schoolboy studying the history of the Civil War in England. This partition has one cell labeled 'Cromwell'-and so it does not distinguish between Oliver and his son Richard. Another example might be the partition utilized by those who talk of 'China' as if the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China were one single object. To eliminate such ambiguity we lay down a requirement to the effect that each partition must be such that its associated projection is a functional relation: MB3: \u0000 \u0017 \u0000\u0002\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0013\u0004 \u001a=\"\u0005$-% \u0000 \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 \u0001\u0014\u0007 \u001a*) \u0001\u0013\u0004\u0010@ \u0001\u0014\u0007 For partitions satisfying MB3, cells are projected onto single objects (one rather than two). Consider the left part of Figure 3. The dotted arrow can occur in partitions satisfying merely MB1–2 but not in partitions also satisfying MB3. Notice, though, that projection might still be a partial function, since MB3 does not rule out the case where there are empty cells. To impose the functionality of projection on all partitions is in one respect trivial. For we can very easily convert a partition which does not satisfy MB3 into one which does. If \u0000 is a cell in which does not satisfy MB3, then we create this new partition \u0006\u0005 by adjusting in such a way that \u0000 now projects upon the mereological sum of the objects A Theory of Granular Partitions 13 Figure 3: Transparent partitions in which projection is not functional (left); location is not functional (right) its projects upon in . This account seems, indeed, to do justice to what is involved in the confused schoolboy case, namely that Richard and Oliver are run together, somehow, into one composite human being. In the remainder of this paper we use the notation \u00012@\u0001\u0000 \u0017\u0019\u0000 \u001a instead of \u0000 \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 \u0001 \u001a whenever we assume that projection is functional. 4.4.2 Location is functional: the Morning Star and the Evening Star Consider a partition having root cell labeled 'heavenly bodies' and three subcells labeled: 'The Morning Star', 'The Evening Star', and 'Venus', respectively. As we know, all three subcells project onto the same object. This partition is perfectly consistent with the conditions we have laid out thus far. Its distinct subcells truly, though unknowingly, project onto the same object. It is not unusual that we give different names (or classlabels) to things in cases where we do not know that they are actually the same. A good partition, though, should clearly be one in which such errors are avoided. Partitions manifesting the desired degree of correspondence to objects in this respect must in other words be ones in which location, too, is a functional relation: MB4: \u0000 \u0017 \u0001/\u0001\u0003\u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a=\"\u0005$\u0002% \u0000 \u0017 \u0001/\u0001 \u0000\u0012\u0007 \u001a*) \u0000\u0005\u0004 @A\u0000\u0012\u0007 In partitions that satisfy MB4, location is a function, i.e., objects are located at single cells (one rather than two). Consider the right part of Figure 3. The dotted arrow can occur in partitions satisfying MB1–2, not however in partitions also satisfying MB4. As MB3 rules out co-location (overcrowding), so MB4 rules out co-projection (redundancy). Note that natural analogues of co-location and co-projection are not even formulable within a set-theoretic framework. 5 CORRESPONDENCE OF MEREOLOGICAL STRUCTURE MB1 and MB2 are, even when taken together with MB3 and MB4, still very weak. They tell us only that, if a cell in a partition projects upon some object, then that object is indeed located in the corresponding cell. They do not tell us what happens in case a cell fails to 14 Foundations of Geographical Information Science project onto anything at all. MB1–4 thus represent only a first step along the way towards an account of correspondence to reality for partitions. Such correspondence will involve the two further dimensions of structural mapping and of completeness. 5.1 Recognizing mereological structure An object \u0001 is recognized by a partition if and only if the latter has a cell in which that object is located (Smith and Brogaard, 2002b). Intuitively, recognition is the partitiontheoretic analogue of the standard set-membership relation. Partitions embody the selective focus of our mapping, classifying, and listing activities. To impose a partition on a given domain of reality is to foreground certain objects and features in that domain and trace over others. Note hereby that we trace over not only the objects which surround that which is foregrounded, as according to the usual understanding of the foreground/background structure; for we also trace over those parts of the foregrounded object which fall beneath the threshold of our concerns. Partitions are granular in virtue precisely of the fact that a partition can recognize an object without recognizing all its parts. Partitions-think again of Venn diagrams-are designed to reflect the part-whole structure of reality through the fact that the cells in a partition are themselves such as to stand in relations of part to whole. Given the master conditions expressed within the framework of theory (A) above, partitions have at least the potential to reflect the mereological structure of the domain onto which they are projected. And in felicitous cases this potential is realized. That we distinguish between the recognition (foregrounding, selection) of objects on the one hand and the reflection of mereological structure on the other hand is not an arbitrary matter. In Tractarian semantics we distinguish between projection and isomorphism. In set theory we distinguish, for any given set, between a domain of elements and the settheoretic structure imposed on this domain. Just as it is possible to have sets consisting entirely of Urelemente (together with a minimal amount of set-theoretic packaging), so it is possible to have partitions built exclusively out of minimal cells (and one root cell). Such partitions amount, simply, to lists of the things that are recognized by their cells, with no mereological structure on the side of these objects being brought into account. (a) (b) (c) Figure 4: Transparent partitions with more or less desirable properties Figure 4(a) and 4(b) represent partitions consisting of two minimal cells \u0000 \u0004 and \u0000\u0012\u0007 projecting onto objects \u0001 \u0004 and \u0001\u0014\u0007 . Case (a), a simple list, is unproblematic. Case (b) we A Theory of Granular Partitions 15 shall also allow. This is in keeping with the notion that minimal cells are the (relative) atoms of our system, and we take this to mean that they should be neutral with regard to any mereological structure on the side of their objects. An example of type (b) would be a list of regions represented at a conference to discuss measures against terrorism, a conference including representatives from both Germany and Bavaria. Cases like (c), in contrast, represents projections in which, intuitively, something has gone wrong. All three cases satisfy the master conditions we have laid down thus far, for the latter allow both for disjoint cells to be projected onto what is not disjoint (b) and also for disjoint objects to be located in cells which are not disjoint (c). Cases like (c) on the other hand seem to fly in the face of a fundamental principle underlying the practice of hierarchical classification, namely that objects recognized by species lower down in a hierarchical tree should be included as parts in whatever is recognized by the genera further up the tree. To exclude cases like (c) we shall impose a condition to the effect that mereological structure within a partition should not misrepresent the mereological relationships between the objects which the corresponding cells are projected onto. We first of all define the following relation of representation of mereological structure between pairs of cells: DS1: \u0000\u0002\u0001 \u0017\u0019\u0000\u0005\u0004\u0012\u0001\u0003\u0000\u0012\u0007 \u001a & \u0001\u0013\u0004\u0012\u0001\u0002\u0001\u0014\u0007\u000e'-\u0017 \u0000\u001b\u0017 \u0001\u0013\u0004\u0014\u0001 \u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a=\"\u0005$\u0002% \u0000 \u0017 \u0001\u0014\u0007 \u0001 \u0000\u0012\u0007 \u001a \"\u0013$\u0002% \u0000\u0005\u0004\u001b ?\u0000\u0012\u0007 \u001a ) \u0001\u0013\u0004 \u0007 \u0001\u0014\u0007 If \u0000 \u0004 is a subcell of \u0000 \u0007 then any object recognized by \u0000 \u0004 must be a part of any object recognized by \u0000\u0012\u0007 . A partition is then mereologically structure-preserving if and only if each pair of cells within the partition satisfies DS1: DS2: \u0000\u0002\u0001 \u0017 \u001b\u001a*\u001c,& \u0000 \u0004 \u0001 \u0000 \u0007 '\u0002\u0017 \u0017\u0019\u0000 \u0004 \u0001 \u001b\u001a=\"\u0005$-%( \u0017\u0019\u0000 \u0007 \u0001 !\u001a \u001a\u001d) \u0000\u0002\u0001 \u0017 \u0000 \u0004 \u0001 \u0000 \u0007 \u001a . We can now impose a new master condition: MB5: All partitions are mereologically structure-preserving in the sense of DS2. Note that even MB5 is still very weak. Its effect is entirely negative, since it merely ensures that partitions do not misrepresent the mereological relationships between their objects. Partitions might still be entirely blind to (trace over) such relationships. Two minimal cells might project onto objects which stand to each other in any one of the possible mereological relations (identity, proper parthood, disjointness, overlap), and all pairs of cells are likewise neutral as to the mereological relations between the objects onto which they are projected provided only that they do not stand to each other in the subcell relation. This means that, given such cells, we are entitled to infer nothing at all about the mereological relations among the corresponding objects. Consider, for example, a partition that contains cells, \u0000 \u0004 and \u0000 \u0007 , that recognize John and his arm, respectively, so that \u0000 \u0017\u0004\u0003\u0006\u0005\b\u0007/9;\u0001\u0003\u0000 \u0004 \u001a and \u0000 \u0017\t\u0003\u0006\u0005 \u0007/9 \u0005 \u000e \u0001\u0010\u000f \u0001 \u0000 \u0007 \u001a . Then cell \u0000 \u0004 need not be a proper subcell of the cell \u0000 \u0007 , for the partition may not know that the object located in \u0000 \u0007 is properly designated as John's arm. Or consider a partition containing two cells that recognize, respectively, mammals and whales. Suppose that this is a partition constructed at a time when the status of whales as mammals was not yet recognized. The cell labeled whales is not, then, included as a subcell of the cell labeled mammals. But the partition can still satisfy our conditions laid down so far. This is so, for example, if the 16 Foundations of Geographical Information Science cell that recognizes whales is a subcell of the cell recognizing animals but not a subcell of any other subcell of the cell recognizing animals (Partition \u0004 in Figure 5). If the cell that recognizes whales were also a subcell of the cell that recognizes fish, for example, then the partition would misrepresent the mereological relationship between these two species and so violate MB5 (Partition \u0007 in Figure 5). Figure 5: Partition \u0000\u0002\u0001 does not misrepresent the mereological structure of the underlying domain. Partition \u0000\u0004\u0003 places whales incorrectly in relation to fish and mammals Partitions may trace over mereological relationships between the objects they recognize, but MB5 is strong enough to ensure that, if a partition tells us something about the mereological relationships on the side of the objects which it recognizes, then what it tells us is true. Notice that partition \u0007 still satisfies MB1–4. Consider a domain of objects consisting of two regions, \u0000 and \u0000 , that properly overlap in the region \u0002 , so that \u0000 \b \u00008@ \u0002 with \u0002 \u0004 \u0000 and \u0002 \u0004 \u0000 . Consider now a partition with cells \u0000 \u0004 and \u0000 \u0007 recognizing \u0000 and \u0000 , respectively, so that \u0000 \u0017 \u0000#\u0001\u0003\u0000 \u0004 \u001a and \u0000 \u0017 \u00004\u0001 \u0000 \u0007 \u001a . Assume further that \u0000 \u0004 and \u0000 \u0007 do not stand in any subcell relation to each other, i.e., their partitiontheoretic intersection is empty. Only four possibilities regarding the representation of \u0002 now remain: (1) our partition does not recognize \u0002 at all; (2) it recognizes \u0002 but traces over its mereological relationships to \u0000 and \u0000 ; (3) it recognizes \u0002 through a subcell of \u0000 \u0004 but it traces over the fact that \u0002 could equally well be recognized by a subcell of \u0000\u0013\u0007 ; (4) it recognizes \u0002 through a subcell of \u0000\u0005\u0007 but it traces over the fact that \u0002 could equally well be recognized by a subcell of \u0000\u0013\u0004 . The fifth possibility-of allowing sub-cells of both \u0000 \u0004 and \u0000\u0012\u0007 to recognize \u0002 is excluded by the tree structure of granular partitions. Let \u0000 and \u0000 be two neighboring countries which disagree about the exact location of their common boundary and let \u0002 be the disputed area. The inhabitants of country \u0000 consider \u0002 to be part of \u0000 , the inhabitants of country \u0000 consider \u0002 to be part of \u0000 . Possibility (1) then corresponds to the view of some third country at the other side of the globe who recognizes the countries \u0000 and \u0000 but does not care about their border dispute. (2) corresponds to the view of an observer who recognizes that there is a disputed area A Theory of Granular Partitions 17 but who is neutral about the status of the disputed area. (3) corresponds to the view of country \u0000 and (4) to that of country \u0000 . Another example of case (2) is provided by Germany and Luxemburg, which overlap at their common border on the River Our. The river is part of both countries. Mapmakers normally have no facility to represent cases such as this, and so they either adopt the policy of not representing such common regions at all (the border is represented as a line which we are to imagine as being without thickness), or they recognize the region constituted by the river on the map but trace over its mereological properties. Larger-scale maps often embrace a third alternative, which is to misrepresent the relations between Germany and Luxenburg by drawing the boundary between the two countries as running down the center of the river. 5.2 The domain of a partition That upon which a partition is projected is a certain domain of objects in reality (the term 'domain' being understood in the mereological sense). We shall conceive the domain of a partition as the mereological sum of the pertinent objects. It is, as it were, the total mass of stuff upon which the partition sets to work: thus it is stuff conceived as it is prior to any of the divisions or demarcations effected by the partition itself. The domains of partitions will comprehend not only individual objects and their constituents (atoms, molecules, limbs, organs), but also groups or populations of individuals (for example biological species and genera, battalions and divisions, archipelagos and diasporas) as well as their constituent parts or members. Domains can comprehend also extended regions (continua) of various types. Spatial partitions, for example maps of land use or soil type (Frank et al., 1997), are an important family of partitions with domains of this sort. There are also cases where partitions impose upon continuous domains a division into discrete units for example by creating temperature or frequency bands. We are now able to specify what we mean by 'domain of a partition.' Our representation of partitions as trees and our condition on reflection of structure (MB5) ensure that all partitions trivially reflect the fact that the objects recognized by their cells are parts of some mereological sum. For MB5 is already strong enough to ensure that everything that is located at some cell of a partition is part of what is located at the corresponding root cell. If any cell pointed outside of what is located at the root cell it would misrepresent the mereological structure of the corresponding domain. We can thus define the domain of a partition simply as the object (mereological whole) onto which its root cell is projected. By functionality of projection and location there can be only one such object. DD: \u0000 \u0017 !\u001a @ \u0000 \u0017 . \u0017 !\u001a \u001a We now demand as a further master condition that every partition has a non-empty domain in the sense of DD: MB6: \u0002 \u0000 ' \u0000 @\u0001\u0000 \u0017 !\u001a We then say that a partition represents its domain correctly if and only if MA1–5 and MB1–6 hold. Note that this condition of correctness is still rather easily satisfied. (It is 18 Foundations of Geographical Information Science achieved already in every simple list, provided only that the list involves no double counting and no ambiguous reference of the sort involved in the Oliver and Richard Cromwell case.) If there is a single maximal object (the whole universe), then one correct representation thereof is provided by a partition consisting of just one cell labeled 'everything' (we might call this the Spinoza partition). A partition with just three cells: a root cell, labeled animals, and two subcells, labeled dogs and cats, represents its domain correctly; it just falls far short of a certain desirable completeness. Correct representations, as we see, can be highly partial. 5.3 The granularity of granular partitions A correct representation, as we see, is not necessarily a complete representation. Indeed, since partitions are cognitive devices, and cognition is not omniscient, it follows that no partition is such as to recognize all objects. There is no map of all the objects in the universe. The complexity of the universe is much greater than the complexity of any single cognitive artifact. This feature of partiality is captured already by our terminology of granular partitions. Partitions characteristically do not recognize the proper parts of the whole objects which they recognize; for example they do not recognize parts which fall beneath a certain size. It is the cells of a partition which carry with them this feature of granularity. Because they function like singletons in set theory, they recognize only single whole units, the counterparts of set-theoretic elements or members. If a partition recognizes not only wholes but also one or more parts of such wholes, then this is because there are additional cells in the partition which do this recognizing job. Consider, for example, a partition that recognizes human beings and has cells that project onto John, Mary, and so forth. This partition does not recognize parts of human beings-such as John's arm or Mary's shoulder-unless we add extra cells for this purpose. Even if a partition recognizes both wholes and also some of their parts, it is not necessarily the case that it also reflects the mereological relationships between the two. Imagine we are forensic scientists examining photographs taken at a crime scene and that these photographs generate a partition with cells recognizing John, Mary, and an arm. It may then be the case that the state of our knowledge is such that the cell recognizing the arm is not a subcell of the cell recognizing either John or Mary. Or let the arm be Kashmir and let John and Mary be India and Pakistan, respectively. In relation to this granularity of partitions, we can once more call in the aid of Wittgenstein: In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents. They must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity ... (4.04) Wittgenstein himself takes care of the issue of granularity by insisting that the world is made up of discrete simples, and by insisting further that all partitions (for Wittgenstein: propositions) picture complexes of such simples. (A similar simplifying assumption is proposed by Galton, 1999.) This is a simplifying assumption, which our present theory A Theory of Granular Partitions 19 of granular partitions will enable us to avoid. For the latter admits partitions of arbitrary granularity including partitions which reflect distinct cross-cuttings of the same domain of reality (Smith and Brogaard, 2002a). The theory of granular partitions enables us moreover to remain neutral as to the existence of any ultimate simples in reality from out of which all other objects would be constructed via summation. This is due to the fact that partitions are by definition top-down structures. The duality with trees puts special emphasis on this aspect: we trace down from the root until we reach a leaf. A leaf has no further parts within the partition to which it belongs. But it need not necessarily project upon something that itself has no parts. The fact that there are leaves simply indicates that a partition does not care about (traces over) what lies beneath a certain level of granularity on the side of its objects. An object located at a minimal cell is an atom only relative to the partition involved. Partitions are cognitive devices which have the built-in capability to recognize objects and to reflect certain features of the latters' mereological structure and to ignore (trace over) other features of this structure. We can now see that they can perform this task of tracing over in two ways: (1) by tracing over mereological relations between the objects which they recognize; (2) by tracing over (which means failing to recognize) parts of those objects. (2) is (unless atomism is true) a variety of tracing over that must be manifested by every partition. A third type of tracing over arises in reflection of the fact that partitions (we leave to one side here the Spinoza partition) are partial in their focus. In foregrounding some regions of reality each partition thereby traces over everything that lies outside its domain. Consider a simple biological partition of the animal kingdom including a cell projecting on the species dog (Canis familiaris). Our definition of the domain of a partition and our constraint on functionality of projection implies that, besides the species dog also your dog Fido, and also Fido's DNA-molecules, proteins, and atoms are parts of the domain of this partition. But the latter are of course not recognized by the partition itself. It is cases such as this which illustrate why mereology requires supplementation by a theory like the one presented here. Partition theory allows us to define a new, restricted notion of parthood that takes granularity into account (compare Degen et al., 2001). This restricted parthood relation is an analogue of partition-theoretic inclusion, but on the side of objects: DRP: \u0000 \u0007\u0010\u000f \u0000 \u0002 \u0000\u0014\u0004\u0014\u0001 \u0000\u0012\u0007\u000e' \u0000 \u000f \u0017 \u0000#\u0001 \u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a#\"\u0013$\u0002% \u0000 \u000f \u0017 \u00004\u0001 \u0000\u0012\u0007 \u001a=\"\u0005$\u0002% \u0000\u0014\u0004\u001b ,\u0000\u0012\u0007 This means that \u0000 is a part of \u0000 relative to partition if and only if: \u0000 is recognized by a subcell of a cell in which recognizes \u0000 . From this we can infer by MB5 that \u0000 is a part of \u0000 also in the unrestricted or absolute sense. The usual common-sense (i.e., non-scientific) partition of the animal kingdom contains cells recognizing dogs and mammals, but no cells recognizing DNA molecules. Relative to this common-sense partition, DNA molecules are not parts of the animal kingdom in the sense defined by DRP, though they are of course parts of the animal kingdom in the usual, non-relativised sense of 'part'. 20 Foundations of Geographical Information Science 6 STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF CORRECT REPRESENTATIONS In this section we discuss some of the more fundamental varieties of those partitions which satisfy the master conditions set forth above. We classify such partitions according to: (1) degree of structural fit; (2) degree of completeness and exhaustiveness; (3) degree of redundancy. 6.1 Mereological monotony We required of partitions that they at least not misrepresent the mereological structure of the domain they recognize. This constraint is to be understood in such a way that it leaves room for the possibility that a partition is merely neutral about (traces over) some or all aspects of the mereological structure of its target domain. Taking this into account, we can order partitions according to the degree to which they actually do represent the mereological structure on the side of the objects onto which they are projected. At the maximum degree of structural fit we have those partitions which completely reflect the mereological relations holding between the objects which they recognize. Such a partition satisfies a condition to the effect that if \u0001 \u0004 is part of \u0001 \u0007 , and if both \u0001 \u0004 and \u0001 \u0007 are recognized by the partition, then the cell at which \u0001 \u0004 is located is a subcell of the cell at which \u0001 \u0007 is located. Such partitions satisfy the weak converse of MB5. Formally we can express this constraint on mereological structure (CM) as follows: CM: \u0000\u001b\u0017 \u0001\u0013\u0004\u0005\u0001 \u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a=\"\u0005$\u0002% \u0000 \u0017 \u0001\u0014\u0007\u0013\u0001 \u0000\u0012\u0007 \u001a=\"\u0005$-% \u0001\u0013\u0004 \u0007 \u0001\u0014\u0007 ) \u0000\u0005\u0004\u001b ?\u0000\u0012\u0007 A partition satisfying CM is mereologically monotonic. This means that it recognizes all the restricted parthood relations obtaining in the pertinent domain of objects. A very simple example is given by a flat list (a partition having only minimal cells together with a root) projected one-for-one upon a collection of disjoint objects. 6.2 Completeness So far we have allowed partitions to contain empty cells, i.e., cells that do not project onto any object. We now consider partitions which satisfy the constraint that every cell recognizes some object: CC: \u0017 \u0000\u0002\u0001 \u001b\u001a*) \u0002 \u0001 ' \u0000 \u0017 \u0001/\u0001 \u0000 \u001a We say that partitions that satisfy CC project completely. Notice that this condition is independent of the functional or relational character of projection and location. Of particular interest, however, are partitions that project completely and in such a way that projection is a total function (partitions which satisfy both MB3 and CC). An example is a map of the United States representing its constituent states. There are no no-man's lands within the territory projected by such a map and every cell projects uniquely onto just one state. A Theory of Granular Partitions 21 6.3 Exhaustiveness So far we have accepted that there may be objects in our target domain that are not located at any cell. This feature of partitions is sometimes not acceptable: governments want all their subjects to be located in some cell of their partition of taxable individuals. They want their partitions to satisfy a completeness constraint to the effect that every object in the domain is indeed recognized. In this case we say that location is complete. Alternatively we say that the partition exhausts its domain. Unfortunately, we cannot use (*) \u0001 \u0007 \u0000 \u0017 \u001b\u001a ) \u0002 \u0000 ' \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 !\u001a \"\u0013$\u0002% \u0000\u001b\u0017 \u0001/\u0001 \u0000 \u001a to capture the desired constraint. The tax authorities do not (as of this writing) want to tax the separate molecules of their subjects. Trivially, we have: \u0001 \u0007 \u000f \u0000 \u0017 !\u001a\u001d) \u0002 \u0000+' \u0017 \u0000\u0002\u0001 \u001b\u001a=\"\u0005$\u0002% \u0000\u001b\u0017 \u0001/\u0001\u0003\u0000 \u001a but this is much too weak, since it asserts only that every object within a given domain that is recognized by a partition is indeed recognized by that partition. It will in fact be necessary to formulate several restricted forms of exhaustiveness, each one of which will approximate in different ways to the (unrealizable) condition expressed in (*). One such exhaustiveness condition might utilize a sortal predicate (schema) \u0001 that singles out the kinds of objects our partition is supposed to recognize (for example, in the case of the partition of taxable individual human beings, rather than proper parts of human beings). We now demand that the partition recognize all of those objects in its domain which satisfy \u0001 : CE \u0002 : \u0001 \u0007 \u0000 \u0017 !\u001a#\"\u0013$\u0002% \u0001 \u0017 \u0001 \u001a\u001d) \u0002 \u0000+' \u0017 \u0000\u0002\u0001 \u001b\u001a \"\u0013$\u0002% \u0000\u001b\u0017 \u0001/\u0001 \u0000 \u001a Let \u0003 be some domain and let be a partition such that \u0003 @ \u0000 \u0017 !\u001a . Since we can very simply use any predicate to define a partition over any domain – by setting \u0000\u001d\u000f \u0017 \u0001/\u0001\u0003\u0000 \u001a* \u0001 \u0004 \u0003 \"\u0005$-% \u0001 \u0017 \u0001 \u001a – we can also think of CE \u0002 as asserting the completeness of one partition relative to another. Note that the idea underlying CE \u0002 is closely related to the idea of granularity. Thus for some purposes we might find it useful to formulate condition \u0001 as a restriction on object size. The tax office probably does not care too much about empty cells in its partition, nor is it bothered too much by the idea of charging you twice. The main issue is to catch everything above a certain resolution at least once. This is the intuition behind constraints like CE \u0002 . If you are a law-abiding citizen, you will accept CE \u0002 (where ' \u0001 ' stands for 'is a citizen'), but you will insist that the partition not locate you in two separate cells, i.e., that you are not charged twice. This means that you want the tax partition to satisfy CE \u0002 and MB4. There might be a pedantic clerk in the tax office who does not rest until he has made sure that all empty cells have been removed. Partitions that will satisfy you, the government, and the clerk in the tax office must satisfy CC, CE \u0004 , and MB1–5. Projection and location are then total functions (relative to a selected predicate \u0005 ) and one is the inverse of the other. Under those circumstances projection and location are bijective functions. Notice that neither of the following holds: 22 Foundations of Geographical Information Science (**) if MB4 and CE \u0004 and CC then MB3 (***) if MB3 and CE \u0004 and CC then MB4 Counterexamples are given in Figure 6 (a) and (b), respectively, where each depicted object is assumed to satisfy \u0001 . (a) (b) Figure 6: Functionality of projection and location are independent of completeness and exhaustiveness 6.4 Comprehension axioms The following is the partition-theoretic equivalent of the unrestricted set-theoretic comprehension axiom. For each predicate \u0001 there is a partition \u0017 \u0001 \u001a whose location relation is defined as follows: \u0002 \u0000 ' \u0000 \u000f\u0001\u0000 \u0002\u0003\u0002 \u0017 \u0001/\u0001 \u0000 \u001a\u0005\u0004\u0007\u0006 \u0001 \u0017 \u0001 \u001a Under what conditions on \u0001 can this be allowed? One type of restriction that is relevant to our purposes would allow \u0001 to be unrestricted but affirm additional restrictions on objects, for example in terms of spatial location. Thus we might define a family of spatial partitions \u0017 \u0001 \u0001 . \u001a , where . is some pre-designated spatial region, in such a way that \u0002 \u0000 ' \u0000 \u000f\u0001\u0000 \u0002\t\b \u0002 \u0017 \u0001/\u0001 \u0000 \u001a\f\u0004 \u0006 \u0001 \u0017 \u0001 \u001a and \u0001 is spatially located in . . Something like this is in fact at work in the taxation partition (the tax office is interested in human beings bearing a special relation to a specific geographic location), as also in the partitions used by epidemiologists, ornithologists and others who are interested in (types of) objects at specific sites. 6.5 Redundancy Partitions are natural cognitive devices, for example they are lists, maps, and so forth, used by human beings to serve various practical purposes. This means that partitions will normally be called upon to avoid certain sorts of redundancy. Here we distinguish what we shall call correspondence redundancy and structural redundancy. Necessarily empty cells (cells whose labels tell us ex ante that no objects can be located within them) represent one type of correspondence redundancy, which is excluded by condition CC. A Theory of Granular Partitions 23 Another type of correspondence redundancy we have addressed already in our discussion of the functionality of location. This occurs in a partition with two distinct cells whose labels would tell us, again ex ante, that they must necessarily project upon the very same object. Clearly, and most simply, a partition should not contain two distinct cells with identical labels. The following case is not quite so trivial. Consider a partition with a cell labeled vertebrates which occurs as a subcell of the cell labeled chordates in our standard biological classification of the animal kingdom. Almost all chordates are in fact vertebrates. Suppose (for the sake of argument) that biologists were to discover that all chordates must be vertebrates. Then such a discovery would imply that, in order to avoid structural redundancy, they would need to collapse into one cell the two cells (of chordates and vertebrates) which at present occupy distinct levels within their zoological partitions. A constraint designed to rule out such structural redundancy would be: CR: A cell in a partition never has exactly one immediate descendant. This rules out partition-theoretic analogues of the set theorist's \u0000 \u0000\u0001\u0000 \u0001 \u0001 . 7 FULLNESS AND CUMULATIVENESS There are a number of different sorts of knowledge shortfall which should be considered in any complete theory of granular partitions. One type arises when there are missing levels within a hierarchy. A partition of the United Kingdom which mentions regions, counties, towns, etc., but leaves out the cells England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is an example of this sort of incompleteness. More important however are those types of shortfall which have to do with relations between existing levels. We have distinguished thus far completeness, which has to do with the absence of empty cells, and exhaustiveness, which has to do with the successful capturing of all pertinent objects in a given domain. But shortfalls arise also in relation to a third type of completeness, which has to do with ensuring that successive levels of a partition relate to each other in the most desirable way. We can initially divide this third type of completeness into two sub-types: fullness and cumulativeness. Fullness, intuitively, is a requirement to the effect that each cell \u0000 has enough daughter (immediate descendant) cells to fill out \u0000 itself. Cumulativeness is a requirement to the effect that these daughter cells are such that the objects onto which they are projected are sufficient to exhaust the domain onto which the mother cell is projected. Fullness, accordingly, pertains to theory (A), cumulativeness to theory (B). (We shall henceforth assume for the sake of simplicity that there are no redundancies in the sense of CR.) Non-fullness and non-cumulativeness represent two kinds of shortfall in the knowledge that is embodied in a partition. Non-fullness is the shortfall which arises when a cell has insufficiently many subcells within a given partition (for instance it has a cell labeled mammal, but no subcells corresponding to many of the species of this genus). Non-cumulativeness is the shortfall which arises when our projection relation locates insufficiently many objects in the cells of our partition, for example when I strive to make a list of the people that I met at the party yesterday but leave out all the Welshmen. Fullness and cumulativeness are rarely satisfied by our scientific partitions of the natural world. 24 Foundations of Geographical Information Science They are satisfied primarily by artificial partitions of the sort which are constructed in database environments. 7.1 Fullness Consider a partition consisting of three cells, labeled people, Laura and George W. Or consider a partition with three cells labeled: mammals, cats and dogs. Both of these partitions are transparent, by our definition (DTr); but both are, again, such as to fall short of a certain sort of ideal completeness, which we can express by asserting that the mereological sum of the cells Laura and George W. (or of the cells cats and dogs) falls far short of the corresponding partition-theoretic sum. If a collection of subsets of some given set forms a partition of this set in the standard mathematical sense, then these subsets are (1) mutually exhaustive and (2) pairwise disjoint. An analogue of condition (2) holds for minimal cells in our present framework, since minimal cells are always mereologically disjoint (they cannot, by definition, have subcells in common). Condition (1) however does not necessarily hold within the framework of partition theory. This is because, even where the partition-theoretic sum of minimal cells is identical to the root cell, the minimal cells still do not necessarily exhaust the partition as a whole. The mereological sum ( ) of cells is, we will recall, in general smaller than their partition-theoretic sum ( \u0000 ). We call a cell full relative to its descendant cells within a given partition if these descendants are such that their mereological sum and their partition-theoretic sum coincide. Formally we define: DFullcell: \u0000\u0002\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0007\u0006\t\b \u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017\u0019\u0000 \u0004 \u001a \u0017 \u000e \u0010\u000f\u0011 \u0013\u0012 \u0000 \u001a @ \u0017\f\u0014 \u0010\u000f\u0011 \u0012 \u0000 \u001a where \u0017 \u000e \u000f\u0015 \u0012 \u0000 \u001a and \u0017\u0016\u0014 \u0010\u000f\u0011 \u0012 \u0000 \u001a symbolize respectively the operations of applying mereological and partition-theoretic sum for all proper subcells \u0000 of the cell \u0000 \u0004 . Since we can easily prove that \u0017\u0016\u0014 \u0010\u000f\u0015 \u0012 \u0000 \u001a @\u001f\u0000\u0005\u0004 , DFullcell could be reformulated as asserting that a cell is full if and only if it is identical to the mereological sum of its descendants: \u0000\u0017\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0018\u0006\u0013\b \u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017\u0019\u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a\u0004\u0003 \u0010\u000f\u0015 \u0012 \u00002@A\u0000\u0005\u0004 DFullcell does not suffice to capture the intended notion of fullness for partitions however. To see the problem, consider the partition consisting of top row: one maximal cell, labeled first couple middle row: two intermediate cells, labeled George W. and Laura bottom row: four minimal cells, labeled George W.'s left arm, George W.'s right leg, Laura's left arm, Laura's right leg. The cell in the top row satisfies DFullcell, i.e. it is full relative to the second row; but it is not full relative to all of its descendants, since the mereological sum of the cells George W.'s arm and George W.'s leg is not identical to the cell George W. (and analogously for Laura). The problem arises because if \u0000 \u0007 \u0000 then \u0000 \u0000+@ \u0000 and if \u00008 \u0000 then \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 @ \u0000 . From this it follows that only the immediate descendants of a given cell \u0000 \u0004 contribute to its mereological and partition-theoretic sums. A Theory of Granular Partitions 25 This, however, tells us what we need to take into account in defining what it is for a cell to be full relative to all its descendant cells within a given partition , namely that each of its constituent cells must be full relative to its immediate descendents. This yields: DFullcell*: \u0000\u0017\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0018\u0006\u0013\b \u0003\u0005\u0003 \b \u0017\u0019\u0000 \u0004 \u0001 !\u001a & \u0000+'\u0013\u0000+ ,\u0000 \u0004 ) \u0017 \u0000\u0017\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0018\u0006\u0013\b \u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017 \u0000 \u001a \u0003 \u0005 687:9 \u0017 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002\u0010\u001a\u0003\u001a Here minimal cells have been handled separately because they do not have subcells. One can see that, while \u0000\u0017\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0018\u0006\u0013\b \u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017\u0004\u0003\u0004\u0001 \u0006\u0005 \u0006 \u0005 \u0001\b\u0007\u0011\u0003\u0007\b \u001a holds in the mentioned partition,\u0000\u0017\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0018\u0006\u0013\b \u0003\u0005\u0003 \b \u0017\t\u0003 \u0001 \u0006\u0005 \u0006 \u0005 \u0001\b\u0007\u0011\u0003\u0018\b \u001a does not, because the cells George W. and Laura are neither full nor minimal. We can now define what it means for a partition to be full, as follows: DFull2: \u0000\u0002\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017 \u001b\u001a ?& \u0000+' \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 !\u001a;) \u0017 \u0000\u0017\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0018\u0006\u0013\b \u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017 \u0000 \u001a \u0003 \u0005>\u0016\n\n*\u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 !\u001a \u001a A partition is full if and only if all its non-minimal cells are full (or, equivalently, all its non-minimal cells are full*). Notice that full partitions might in principle contain empty cells, which may or may not have subcells. (Consider, for example, the cell dodo with subcells male dodo and female dodo.) 7.2 Empty space When a cell falls short of fullness, this means that, while the cell successfully projects onto some given domain, its subcells do not succeed in projecting onto the entirety of this domain. It is then as if there is some extra but invisible component in the cell, in addition to its subcells. We shall call this additional component 'empty space' (noting that the term 'empty' here has a quite different meaning from what it has in the phrase 'empty cell'). Consider the partition depicted in Figure 2. Here the empty space is that part of the cell mammals that is not occupied by cats and dogs. Notice that this empty space is a component of the cell mammals but it is not itself a cell nor is it made up of cells. Empty space is that part of a cell that is not covered by its subcells. The notion of empty space is then similar to the notion of hole in the sense of Casati and Varzi (1994). A hole requires an object which serves as its host. A hole is in every case a hole in something. In the same sense empty space requires a cell within which it can exist as empty space. As a hole is a concavity of a host object where no parts of this host object are to be found, so empty space is a zone within a cell where no subcells are to be found. Empty space within a cell is like a hole also in the sense that there must be something that potentially fills it. In our case this means: more subcells. If all the empty space in a cell is filled, then the cell itself is full and the empty space has been eliminated. Empty space is inert in the sense that it does not project onto anything. Empty space is normally hidden to the user of the partition in which it exists, for otherwise this user would surely have constructed a fuller partition. In some cases however a user might deliberately accept empty space in order to have means to acknowledge the fact that something has been left out. Alternatively, the existence of empty space in a given partition might be brought to the attention of the user. We point in a certain direction and ask: What is there? The theory of empty space thereby serves as the starting-point for an ontology of questions (Schuhmann and Smith, 1987): empty space corresponds to a hole in our knowledge. 26 Foundations of Geographical Information Science 7.3 Empty space and knowledge The presence or absence of empty space is a dimension of a granular partition that is skew to the dimension pertaining to the existence of empty cells. An empty cell is a cell that fails to project. Empty space is that which leaves room for the addition of new knowledge. It is a zone within a cell that is not (but given advances in knowledge, could be) occupied by further subcells. Notice, however, that there cannot be a partition that is full and yet consists entirely of empty cells. This is because by MB6 every partition projects onto some object. Figure 2 (a) depicts a partition of the animal kingdom consisting of three cells, where \u0000 \u0015 recognizes the animal kingdom as a whole, \u0000 \u0004 recognizes dogs, and \u0000 \u0007 recognizes cats. In terms of partition-theoretic union we have \u0000 \u0004 \u0000 \u0000 \u0007 @ \u0000 \u0015 , but clearly \u0000=\u0017 \u0000 \u0004 \u001a \u0000=\u0017 \u0000 \u0007 \u001a \u0004 \u0000 \u0017\u0019\u0000 \u0015 \u001a . New cells can be inserted into the partition if new species are discovered (e.g., the species indicated by \u0001\u0005\u0015 \u001a . Empty space from one point of view reflects the potential for adding new knowledge. From another point of view it can be seen as a matter of hidden knowledge. From this perspective it is as if we start from partitions which reflect the way God sees reality. Empty space then covers up what we humans do not yet know. The latter view was developed by Mislove et al. (1990) and resulted in the theory of partial sets. What we call empty space Mislove compares to packaging material. If we remove packaging material we potentially discover new things that were previously hidden from view. Our distinction between full and non-full partitions corresponds very closely to the distinction between 'clear' and 'murky' sets drawn in the theory of partial sets. 7.4 Fullness and emptiness Since we have \u0000\u0017\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0018\u0006\u0013\b \u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017 \u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a\u0004\u0003 \u0017 \u000e \u0010\u000f\u0011 \u0012 \u0000 \u001a @ \u0000\u0005\u0004 , we also have \u0000 \u0000\u0017\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0018\u0006\u0013\b \u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017\u0019\u0000\u0013\u0004 \u001a \u0003 \u0017\u0016 \u000f\u0015 \u0012 \u0000 \u001a \u0004 \u0000\u0005\u0004 . Consequently we can define what it means for \u0000 to be the empty space of the cell \u0000 \u0004 as follows. We first of all define \u0000 fills \u0000\u0013\u0004 : DFills: \u0000 7 \u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017 \u0000#\u0001 \u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a \u0000 \u0000\u0017\u0001\u0004\u0003\u0005\u0003\u0018\u0006\u0013\b \u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017\u0019\u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a=\"\u0005$-% \u0000 A\u0017 \u0010\u000f\u0011 \u0013\u0012 \u0000 \u001a @A\u0000\u0005\u0004 The empty space in \u0000\u0013\u0004 is then its smallest filler and we define that \u0000 is the empty space in \u0000\u0005\u0004 if and only if \u0000 fills the space not occupied by the subcells of \u0000 \u0004 and \u0000 is disjoint from all subcells of \u0000 \u0004 : DES: \u0001 \u0001 \u0017 \u0000#\u0001 \u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a \u0000 7 \u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017 \u0000=\u0001 \u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a=\"\u0005$-%\u000e& \u0000 ' \u0000 7 \u0003\u0005\u0003 \u0017 \u0000 \u0001\u0003\u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a\u001d) \u0000 \u0007 \u0000 We note in passing that minimal cells, on the basis of the definitions above, are either empty (they do not project) or they are completely made up of empty space. ('Minimal' means: there is no further knowledge available, within a given partition, as concerns the objects onto which minimal cells are projected.)\u0001 \u0001 determines the empty space of a cell uniquely. To prove this, assume \u0001 \u0001 \u0017\u0003\u0002=\u0001 \u0001 \u001a and \u0001 \u0001 \u0017 \u00004\u0001 \u0000 \u001a . For simplicity we use ' \u0004 ' as an abbreviation for ' \u0017\u0016 \u0012\u0013\u000f\u0011 \u0012\u0000 \u0004 \u001a '. We can then rewrite \u0001 \u0001 \u0017 \u0000=\u0001 \u0000 \u001a as: \u0000 \u0005\u0004 @3\u0000 and &\u0007\u0006 ' \u0006 \u0005\u0004\u000e@ \u0000 ) \u0000 \u0007 \u0006 , and rewrite \u0001 \u0001 \u0017 \u00004\u0001\u0003\u0000 \u001a as: \u0000 \b\u0004\u001b@\u001f\u0000 and & \u0002 ' \u0002 \u0004!@A\u0000 ) \u0000 \u0007 \u0002 .

In particular A Theory of Granular Partitions 27 this holds in the case of &\u0007\u0006 \u0001 \u0002+' \u0006 @ \u0002 . Now assume that \u0000\u0001\u0000@ \u0000 . This means that for all \u0006 : if \u0006 \b\u0004\u000e@ \u0000 \b\u0004\u001b@ \u0000 \b\u0004 then \u0017 \u0000 \u0004 \u0006 \"\u0005$-% \u0000 \u0007 \u0006 \u001a or \u0017 \u0000 \u0007 \u0006+\"\u0013$\u0002% \u0000 \u0004 \u00064\u001a . Without loss of generality consider for all \u0006 : if \u0006 \u0004\u0010@ \u0000 \b\u0004 @ \u0000 \u0004 then \u0017 \u0000 \u0004 \u0006 \"\u0013$\u0002% \u0000 \u0007 \u0006 \u001a . Now without loss of generality consider for all \u0006 : if \u0006 \u0005\u0004 @ \u0000 \u0005\u0004 then \u0000 \u0004 \u0006 . Since for all\u0006 : \u0006 \u0004\u0010@ \u0000 \u0004 holds by assumption it in particular this holds for \u0006 @ \u0000 . Consequently we have \u0002 \u0006 ' \u0006 \b\u0004 @ \u0000 \b\u0004 and \u0006 @ \u0000 and \u0006 \u0004 \u0000 leading to a contradiction of the form\u0002 \u0006 \u0001 \u0000 ' \u0006 @ \u0000 and \u0006 \u0000@ \u0000 . Consequently we have \u0000 @ \u0000 as desired. 7.5 Cumulativeness We can now define the notion of cumulativeness, which plays the same role in theory (B) which fullness plays in theory (A). The intuitive idea is as follows: a cell is cumulative relative to its immediate descendant cells if the mereological sum of the projections of these immediate descendants is identical to the projection of their partition-theoretic sum. For non-empty and non-minimal cells with at least two immediate descendants we define: DCu1: \u0002 \u0001 \u0017 \u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a* \u000f\u0015 \u0012 \u0000 \u0017\u0019\u0000 \u001a @ \u0000 \u0017\f\u0014 \u0010\u000f\u0011 \u0012 \u0000 \u001a One can see that \u0000=\u0017\u0016\u0014 \u0010\u000f\u0011 \u0013\u0012 \u0000 \u001a @ \u0000=\u0017 \u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a holds under the given conditions. Consequently: \u0002 \u0001 \u0017\u0019\u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a \u0003 \u000f\u0015 \u0012 \u0000 \u0017\u0019\u0000 \u001a @ \u0000 \u0017\u0019\u0000\u0005\u0004 \u001a Again, \u0002 \u0001 \u0017\u0019\u0000 \u0004 \u001a ensures that \u0000 \u0004 is cumulative relative to its immediate descendants. In order to ensure cumulativeness of a cell with respect to all its subcells, we define DCu2: \u0002 \u0001 \b \u0017\u0019\u0000 \u0004 \u0001 \u001b\u001a ?& \u0000+'\u0013\u0000+ ,\u0000 \u0004 ) \u0017\u0003\u0002 \u0001 \u0017 \u0000 \u001a \u0003 \u0005 687:9>\u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 \u001b\u001a \u001a A partition is cumulative if and only if all its cells are cumulative. DCu3: \u0002 \u0001 \u0017 \u001b\u001a ,& \u0000(' \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 !\u001a;) \u0017\u0003\u0002 \u0001 \u0017 \u0000 \u001a \u0003 \u0005 6 7:9>\u0017 \u0000\u0002\u0001 \u001b\u001a \u001a Another way of expressing this is as follows: a partition is cumulative if and only if it has a basis in objects (the objects projected by its minimal cells), and is then built up in stages in such a way that each non-minimal cell \u0000 projects onto the mereological sum of the objects projected by \u0000 's immediate descendants. Recall that the notions of fullness and cumulativeness are intended to characterize partitions that have no redundancies of the sort defined in CR. A cumulative partition is also exhaustive (CE \u0002 ) with \u0001 @ \u0002 \u0000+' \u0017 \u0000\u0002\u0001 \u001b\u001a and \u0000 \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 \u0001 \u001a . 7.6 Classes of partitions regarding fullness and cumulativeness We can now distinguish four classes of partitions regarding their fullness and cumulativeness: Full and cumulative. Consider a list of the 50 US States, divided into two sub-lists: the contiguous 48, the non-contiguous 2. Here the objects towards which this partition is directed are the States themselves under the obvious 'Utah'–Utah projection relation. 28 Foundations of Geographical Information Science Full and non-cumulative. Consider Figure 7 (a). This partition represents the belief of some child who thinks that cats and dogs are the only animals there are. Non-full and cumulative. Consider Figure 7 (b). This partition represents the way a child sees the world who does not understand the concepts of the Northern and Southern hemisphere and who thinks that there are places on Earth that are neither in the Northern, nor in the Southern Hemisphere, nor overlapping both, but are rather in some secret and wonderful land that has not yet been discovered. Non-full and non-cumulative. Consider Figure 7 (c). Imagine that you have a terrible hangover, and your accounting of the people at the party last night consists of a root with three subcells: you, John, and Mary. You know that you are missing somebody, but you cannot remember who. cats dogs animals Southern Hemisphere Northern Hemisphere Earth John Mary Sally John Mary you you party (a) (b) (c) Figure 7: Examples of non-full and non-cumulative partitions. We humans are often aware of the fact that our partitions are not full or not cumulative, or both. In the former case empty cells are often included into the cell structure in order to make explicit our awareness of these shortcomings. Consider, for example, the periodic table of the elements, which contains empty cells (labeled ununnilium, etc.), for elements not yet synthesized. Moreover the fact that the periodic table in its current form has a structure that can only accommodate a certain number of cells is not taken to imply that in reality there could not be elements whose discovery would require the table to be extended. 8 IDENTITY OF GRANULAR PARTITIONS As a step towards a definition of identity for partitions Smith and Brogaard (2002b) propose a partial ordering relation between partitions, which they define as follows: \u0007\u0001\u0000 ,& \u0000(' \u0017\u0019\u0000-\u0001 \u001b\u001a*) \u0017 \u0000\u0002\u0001\u0002\u0000 \u001a They then define an equivalence relation on partitions as follows: DE: \u0004\u0003 \u0000 A \u0007\u0005\u0000 \"\u0005$\u0002% \u0000 \u0007 Now, however, we can see that a definition along these lines will work only for partitions which are full. What, then, of those partitions which are equivalent in the sense of DE but not full? What are the relationships between the presence of empty and redundant cells and the question of the identity of partitions? And what is the bearing on the A Theory of Granular Partitions 29 question of identity of the phenomenon of empty space? Can partitions that have empty or redundant cells be identical? Can partitions which are not full be identical? The question of whether or not partitions that have empty or redundant cells are identical cannot be answered without a theory of labeling. Corresponding empty cells in two distinct partitions, if they are to be considered as identical, need to have at least the same labels. We can only address this question informally here, leaving for another place the task of developing the necessary formal theory. As already noted, one makes a different sort of error if one thinks that there are dodos from the error which one makes if one thinks that there is an intra-Mercurial planet. The two corresponding empty cells are thus distinct: they are signs of different sorts of failure arising when we project a partition onto reality. Consider an inventory of the goods you plan to sell in your not-yet-established chain of beer-brewing stores. This is, surely, different from the inventory of the goods I plan to sell in my not-yet-established chain of wine-marketing stores, And this is so even in the event that our respective plans are never realized. Consider the partition of the people in your building according to number of days spent behind bars. You can construct this partition-which is little more than a simple array of numbered boxes-prior to undertaking any actual inquiries as to who, among the people in your building, might be located in its various cells. Thus even before carrying out such inquiries you can know that this is a more refined partition than, for example, the partition of the same group of people according to number of years spent behind bars. The two partitions are distinct, and they will remain distinct even if it should turn out that none of the people in your building has spent any time at all in jail. In both cases all the people in your building would then be located in the cell labeled zero and all the other cells in both partitions would be empty. Yet the two partitions would be nonetheless distinct, not least because their respective maximal cells would have different labels. We can now return briefly to our question whether partitions that are neither full nor cumulative can be said to be identical. One approach to providing an answer to this question would be to point out that, even though two partitions are outwardly identical, they might still be such that there are different ways to fill the corresponding empty space. Suppose we have what are outwardly the same biological taxonomies used by scientists in America and in Australia at some given time, both with the same arrays of empty cells. Suppose these partitions are used in different ways on the two continents, so that, in the course of time, their respective empty space gets filled in different ways. Were they still the same taxonomy at the start? 9 RELATED WORK Variant forms of our granular partitions have been advanced elsewhere, in particular in the literature on Spatial Information Science. What makes spatial or geographic granular partitions particularly interesting is the fact they are very well structured in the sense that they not only obey our master conditions MA1–4 and MB1–6 but are also mereologically monotonic (CM). In addition they are often full and cumulative as well as exhaustive with respect to predicates such as land use, political affiliation, and so on. 30 Foundations of Geographical Information Science Examples of geographic granular partitions are categorical coverages (Chrisman, 1982), which are thematic maps depicting the relationship of a property or attribute to a specific geographical area. A prototypical example of a categorical coverage is the land use map, in which a taxonomy of land use classes is determined (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial, transportation) and some specific area (for example a city) is then evaluated along the values of this taxonomy (Volta and Egenhofer, 1993). Another prototypical example is soil maps, which are based on a classification of soil covering (into clay, silt, sand, etc.). The zones of a categorical coverage are a jointly exhaustive and pair-wise disjoint subdivision of the relevant region of space (Beard, 1988). As discussed in (Bittner and Smith, 2001) categorical coverages can be understood in terms of the interplay of two granular partition: one targeting a region of space, the other targeting some attribute domain. Another important feature of spatial granular partition is that they also recognize topological and geometric properties of the domain they project onto. In order to recognize structure beyond mereology the cell structure of a granular partition must have structural features in addition to the subcell relation between its cells. Examples of granular partitions that take topological structure, i.e. neighborhood relations between adjacent partition cells, into account can be found in Frank and Kuhn (1986); Bittner and Stell (1998); Erwig and Schneider (1997). Applications of granular partitions taking the ordering of the cell structure and the shape of cells into account were discussed in Frank (1992); Freksa (1992); Hernandez (1991). Recently, spatial partitions were applied also to the representation of spatio-temporal phenomena (Erwig and Schneider, 1999) and temporal phenomena (Bittner, 2002). Independently, the notion of granularity was discussed in Stell (1999, 2000) and Stell, this volume. 10 CONCLUSIONS This paper is a contribution to a formal theory of granular partitions. We defined master conditions that need to be satisfied by every partition. These master conditions fall into two groups: (A) master conditions characterizing partitions as systems of cells, and (B) master conditions describing partitions in their projective relation to reality. At the level of theory (A) partitions are systems of cells that are partially ordered by the subcell relation. Such systems of cells are such that they can always be represented as trees, they have a unique maximal element and they do not have cycles in their graphtheoretic representations. But partitions are more than just systems of cells. They are also cognitive devices that are directed towards reality. Theory (B) takes this latter feature into account by characterizing partitions in terms of the relations of projection and location. Cells in partitions are projected onto objects in reality. Objects are located at cells when projection succeeds. We then say that a partition recognizes the objects that are located at its cells. To talk of granular partitions is to draw attention to the fact that partitions are in every case selective; even when they recognize some objects, they will always trace over others. Partitions do not only recognize objects, they are also capable of reflecting the mereological structure of the objects they recognize through a corresponding mereological structure on the side of their cell array. This does not mean, however, that all partitions A Theory of Granular Partitions 31 actually do reflect the mereological structure of the objects they recognize. For it is an important feature of partitions that they are also capable of tracing over mereological structure. There are, for example, large classes of partitions that simply list objects, without caring at all how these objects hang together mereologically. Our discussion of granularity showed that partitions have three ways of tracing over mereological structure: (1) by tracing over mereological relations between the objects which they recognize; (2) by tracing over the parts of such objects; (3) by tracing over the wholes which such objects form. The tracing over of parts is (unless mereological atomism is true) a feature manifested by every partition, for partitions are in every case coarse grained. The tracing over of wholes reflects the property of granular partitions of foregrounding selected objects of interest within the domain onto which they are projected and of leaving all other objects in the background where they fall in the domain of unconcern.

By applying Louis Kauffman's knot-logic, the consistency of subjective consciousness, the plurality of now's, and the necessary relationship between subjective and intersubjective consciousness will be represented in topological space. For a long time, I believed that time must flow like this, without much doubt: Figure 1 But, does it? What if time's arrow doesn't flow straight forward towards the future? I couldn't be sure if time doesn't flow like this, for example, in the shape of a knot: Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 2 | P a g e Figure 2 What is time? What do we understand by 'time'? Is time different than my time-consciousness? In other words, is there objective and subjective time? If my time-consciousness refers to subjective time, what is objective time? Can I understand time beyond my perception of time? 1 Let's say now is 19:13, June 8, 2018 at Gare de l'Est in Paris, France. It takes 30 minutes to go to the Notre Dame from here by bus. Is this objective time? I remember yesterday when I was walking home in the rain, and I think about what to have for dinner in about 10 minutes. Is this subjective time? Here I take my timeconsciousness as time and time as my time-consciousness. Then, why time? Or why time-consciousness? If consciousness refers to the perception of the subjective experiences by an autonomous individual, consciousness is, or is based on, time-consciousness. And our time-consciousness is spatial. This is an attempt to prove that the structure of time is not a straight arrow that flows forwards. In doing so, I will show how an identical subjective consciousness is possible based on time-consciousness and reveal the necessary relationship between subjective and intersubjective consciousness. The problem of 'now' is in the center of the discussion. In my discussion, I deal with two knot models: one is trefoil and the other is Borromean rings. A trefoil knot is the simplest example of a nontrivial knot, which means that it is not possible to untie this knot in three dimensions without cutting it. It is one seamless line, i.e. one ring. Figure 3 1 In this sense, the question of time is basically in the same structure as the question of being. What is being? Can I understand 'being' beyond the realm of my understanding of my own being? Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 3 | P a g e Borromean rings consist of three topological circles which are inter-linked with each other. Figure 4 Knot Logic: Linking as Mutuality Let's name the rings A, B, and C. They are woven in the way that ring A surrounds ring C, ring C surrounds ring B, and ring B surrounds ring A. There are six crossings in this model where the three individual rings are connected and separated. Figure 5 Each crossing, i.e. the link between the rings, manifests the mutual relationships between the rings. Here I apply Louis Kauffman's Knot Logic, which is a variant of set theory that allows mutual relationship (Kauffman 1995). Kauffman presents knot set theory as a diagrammatic alternative to Venn diagrams that models a nonstandard set theory and explains its relationship. Venn diagram shows the possibility of a logical comprehension of the connective tissue in topology and geometry. Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 4 | P a g e Figure 6 Each marker (where A intersects B and B intersects C) is placed in two regions and indicate that at least one of these regions is not empty. Therefore, some A are B and some B are C (Kauffman 2015, 33). Kaufmann articulates its logical connection in relation to theory of knots and links in three dimensional space. Let's say there are undefined objects 'a,' 'b' and a notion of membership is denoted 'a Є b,' which means 'a belongs to.' It will be possible for 'a' to belong to itself or 'a belongs to b' while 'b belongs to a' (Kauffman 1995, 32) Objects will be indicated by non-self intersecting arcs in the plane and a given object may correspond to a multiplicity of arcs, which will be labelled with the label corresponding to the object. And membership is indicated by the diagram as below (Kauffman 1995, 32-33): Figure 7 Here we see that 'a belongs to b.' The arc 'b' is unbroken, while 'a' labels two arcs that meet on opposite sides of 'b,' which represents that 'a passes under b' according to the convention of illustrating one arc passing behind another by putting a break in the arc that passes behind. This pictorial convention is important for the logic and the relationship with three dimensional space (Kauffman 1995, 33). Kaufmann shows this with the example of von Neumann construction of sets of arbitrary finite cardinality that starts with an empty set Φ={ } and building a sequence of sets Xn with X0={ } X1={{ }} X2={{ },{{ }}}. By using overcrossing convention for membership, one can draw a diagram of this construction (Kauffman 1995, 33): Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 5 | P a g e Figure 8 The three rings of Borromean rings mutually belong together and the crossings between the rings show their belongingness to each other. I marked the three crossings on the outer edge as a, b, c, and the other three inside as α, β, and γ. At the crossing 'a,' where the ring C is placed under the ring A, C belongs to A. At each crossing, there is a membership relationship. See figure 5. The mutuality of the three rings are as below at each crossing: crossing belongingness a C Є A B = {A, C} b A Є B A = {B, C} c B Є C C = {A, B} α A Є B A = {B, C} β B Є C B = {A, C} γ C Є A C = {A, B} The mutual membership relationship between different rings is as below, for example, in the Borromean rings: Figure 9 These sets are the sets that are members of each other. But there are sets that are members of themselves as well (Kauffman 1995, 34): Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 6 | P a g e Figure 10 These diagrams indicate sets that may have a multiplicity of identical members (Kauffman 1995, 34): Figure 11 Instead of regarding the multiplicity of identical members as all equivalent to one another to condense them ({...a, a...} = {...a...}), Kauffman suggests another solution, in which identical members cancel in pair. Thus {...a, a...} = {... ...}, which is {a, a} = { }. And it looks like below in diagram (Kauffman 1995, 3435): Figure 12 The rule of cancellation of identical members is fundamental to knot set theory, as in the second Reidemeister move: Figure 13 Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 7 | P a g e These are the three Reidemesiter moves: Figure 142 A knot consists in a single closed curve and a link may have many closed curves and a tangle has arcs with free ends. Reidemeister proves that any knot or any link in three dimensional space can be represented by a diagram containing only crossings of the type indicated as in the figure 7. And the first Reidemeister move allows the creation or cancellation of self-membership in the corresponding knot set. But if the loop is a physical loop in a rope, \"the cancellation of the loop in the first move must be paid for by a corresponding twist in the rope\" (Kauffman 1995, 38). Figure 15 2 Figure 14: (Kauffman 1995, 36) Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 8 | P a g e According to Kauffman, one can regard it as an exchange rather than an elimination or creation of the loop. If this is applied to the diagram that represents a twisted band, the self-membership is not lost as we move to the topology (Kauffman 1995, 39). \"Any knot set has a representative that is a member of itself and the states of self-membership and non-self membership are equivalent\" (Kauffman 1995, 40). Therefore, a radical knot set is a member of itself and only if it is not a member of itself (Kauffman 1995, 40). And this knot set gives a way to conceptualize non-standard sets without recourse to infinite regress through a twist in the boundary. The self-membering set is represented by a curl, where the observer on the curl itself goes from being container to being a member. This shows that membership becomes topological relationship (Kauffman 1995, 41). The same logic works in a Mobius band as well: A = -A. Figure 16 Kauffman shows that this self-membership solves Russell's paradox. Let R be the set that contains all the sets that do not include themselves. If R contains itself, R does not include itself, but if R does not include itself, R should be a member of itself. But we can solve this paradox in the domain by having every set as a member of itself and not a member of itself (Kauffman 1995, 40). One could regard it not as 'solving' of the paradoxical contradiction but as rather resolving the contradiction.3 Figure 17 3 Based on the comments from Atocha Aliseda (Professor of Philosophy at the Institute for Philosophical Research at UNAM, Mexico) for the author's lecture \"Knotted Space-Time-Consciousness: Intersubjective Subjectivity\" at Instituto de Matemáticas, UNAM, Mexico (Oct 9, 2018).

Figure 18 In a trefoil knot, there are three crossings as in the inner structure of the Borromean rings: α, β, γ. This shows the self-mutuality, because a trefoil knot consists of one seamless ring. Therefore, a trefoil knot represents a stable self-mutuality in three loops about itself: a = {a}. Figure 19 I apply this logic of self-mutuality, i.e. self-membership to explain the consistency of a subjective consciousness throughout the change of time. Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 10 | P a g e How can a subjective 'I' at each different temporal locus a, b, and c be identical? This means that different 'I's at each point of now is the same 'I' with continuity. 'I' at 'a: now (-1),' 'I' at 'b: now (0),' and 'I' at 'c: now (1)' mutually belong together. Figure 20 'I' at each moment has to be able to observe 'I' at another moment which, as the observed, is not the same 'I' from the observant's point of view; instead these different 'I's conform to an identical 'I' that understands this connectivity and the continuity between different moments. To see how this works more precisely, I will place the knot on a plane with axes of time and space. Let's say that vertical lines indicate temporal (y), horizontal lines spatial locations (x). Figure 21 By having a plane of both vertical and horizontal axes of time and space, we can understand the spaceconsciousness which is necessarily attached to my time-consciousness. Time-consciousness is always Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 11 | P a g e spatial. If time is perceived through change which is caused by movements, it always presumes the space that is either the (back)ground of the movement to 'take place' or the act of movement itself creates (results in) space. A linear time-consciousness does not manifest the dimension of space on its single-linear structure. But when we move, either actually moving (our body) from here and there, or reconstructing our memory from then or pre-grasping our future from now, we always and necessarily locate ourselves spatially. When my time-consciousness at each now is constructed through the modification4 of my memory and anticipation, it is impossible for me to recall my experience or expect the experience in the future without its spatial location because these experiences 'take place.' Now, place a trefoil knot on this plane: Figure 22 The point 'o' is placed on the point where x and y meet. At 'o,' I am now here: x(0): y(0). 4 Edmund Husserl uses this term as well to explicate his theory of inner time-consicousness. Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance.

Starting from 'o' the flow passes countless moments on the line including 'p, q, r, s, t, u, v' Figure 24 If we understand 'now' as a point of 'now,' which is 'o,' from there one sees oneself in different temporal and spatial locations – in other words, I 'locate' myself.

Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 13 | P a g e Figure 25 The most interesting act of seeing happens between the points of 'o' and 's' at the crossing, because they are overlapped they share the same temporal and spatial location. Figure 26 Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 14 | P a g e The act of seeing – I (o) see my (present) self (s) – is the basis of the formation of 'self-ness.' In other words, I have to be able to see that I am there as I, for me to be able to perceive myself as I. The I that is observed is I but at the same time not the I, the observer. The subjective understanding of (my)self is based on the distinction of I and not-I and its identity. We can solve the paradox of I = -I with the knot logic of self-mutuality: not-I as knot-I. Figure 27 This is what happens when one sees oneself at different points from where they are standing now, here – spatial/temporal locations. We can call this process 'modification.' This is, however, not only the modification process of time-consciousness but the formation process of consciousness. 5 The reason that I chose \"Vorstellung\" instead of \"imagination\" is to avoid the strongly connected connotation of the word related to \"image\" or \"imago.\" And the \"vor-\" in \"Vorstellung\" could be interpreted as \"pre-\" or \"fore-,\" expressing the \"fore-grasp\" of the future. Vorstellung5 I imagine myself being here/there then. Beobachtung I see myself being here now. Erinnerung I remember myself being here/there back then. Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 15 | P a g e A trefoil knot as a whole is each moment of now, in which there are different now's (the past and the future), i.e. different temporal and spatial location (self-location) in a continuous structure. Figure 28 This connection between now's at each now indicates the modification process and this modification creates the self-ness (subjective) of the consciousness. Conclusion 1. one trefoil knot represents the modification of each now (point of time). The generation of consciousness (self-ness) is based on one's awareness of temporal and spatial location which happens through the modification of multiple points of now's. My consciousness is, therefore, my spatial and temporal consciousness. Self-Mutuality as Mutuality: Mutuality as Self-Mutuality The mutual relationship in the Borromean rings between three different rings could possibly represent the mutual relationship between different 'now's of different subjects: my 'now,' your 'now,' hers, his, etc. Figure 29 Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 16 | P a g e I have already shown that the center of the Borromean rings forms a trefoil knot. This trefoil knot in the Borromean rings has individual sides formed from two different rings that surround it. Therefore, in the self-mutual structure of the identical A, we can find the mutual relationships between three individual rings of the Borromean structure. crossing Belongingness α A Є A / A Є B A = {A} = {B, C} β A Є A / B Є C A = {A} = {C, A} γ A Є A / C Є A A = {A} = {A, B} My (subjective) 'now' is composed of different 'now's, not only mine, but also others' as well. At the same time, the self-mutual (subjective) now is placed in the heart of the (intersubjective) 'mutual' now. The Borromean rings with a trefoil structure within itself manifests the fundamental and necessary relation between mutuality and self-mutuality. Conclusion 2. The logic of mutuality and self-mutuality in the Borromean rings and the trefoil knot models visualizes the fundamental inter-relation of the subjective (self) and intersubjective consciousness and their structure, through which we understand how we are aware of myself and others at the same time. Consciousness 'happens' through the interaction of the perception of self and the perception of not-self (including other objects and observed self). This double perception occurs simultaneously. Consciousness = Self (-consciousness). Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance.

Each now is believed to have its own plane. Figure 30 On the plane of each now, spatial locations are marked. If time is to be understood as the fourth dimension that explains spatial changes, e.g. my being here now and then, my being there now and then, then the flow of time is explained by connecting the points of here and there at each plane of now, and my memory acts as the mediator of connections, i.e. the connecting lines between different points on this and that plane of now's. Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 18 | P a g e Figure 31 These multiple lines between different planes of now's can be crossed or paralleled, but these lines do not describe the 'backward' or 'repeatable' movements of temporal comprehension (modification of consciousness) between the points which modify one's construction of time, understanding it as a flow. At each point of now, there can be multiple 'I's as the subject of time-consciousness. I not only remember being just now, or before a certain amount of time, but I conceive my being in the very next moment through my imagination and expectation. On each plane of now, there are countless points that represent 'now'-ness of my time-consciousness. Firstly, different 'now's of different subjects, and secondly different 'I'-ness of the same subject on the same plane of now. In this context, I raise two questions: a) Are the 'I' on the P and the 'I' on the P′ the same 'I's? b) Can 'I' be here and there at the same time? If so, how? If the second hypothesis is true, there can be multiple 'I's of the identical subject on each plane. On the plane of time and space above, the point 'o' and 's' represent the identical here and now but at the same time different here and now, because there is space for the act of observation between the different points of 'o' and 's.' I will come back to this 'space' between 'o' and 's' more specifically. One might be able to regard each plane as each subject's plane of now. However, neither the multiplicity of now that are scattered here and there on the identical plane of each now, nor their inter-connection between different planes, is explained in the model with paralleled planes of now. The problem of paralleled planes of now is that on each sperate plane, my understanding of 'now' in relation to the past and the future, i.e. my continuous time perception of each moment of now is not fully clarified. In short, here we ought to be able to explain a) how the planes belong together Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 19 | P a g e b) how multiple different points of now on a plane belong together. But, what if the planes of 'now' at each crossing would rather look more like this, if there is a plane at all: Figure 32 Let's 'sew' a seamless string – continuous flow of the time-consciousness of an identical subject into these planes, then it would look like below: Figure 33 And there can be many of them, because there are a great number of individuals.

Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 21 | P a g e And there are knots! and therefore we see crossings and links. Figure 36 The links of these countless knots and their mutual relationships could be explained by Borromean space (connective space): Figure 37 Forthcoming in: When Form Becomes Substance. Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 22 | P a g e Conclusion 3. The multiplicity of now's and their inter-relations can be proven in the knots and their connective space. Time flows in the shape of knots. The connection between now's at each now indicates the modification process, and this modification creates the self-ness (subjective) of consciousness. The generation of consciousness (self-ness) is based on one's awareness of temporal/spatial location which happens through the modification of multiple points of time, which were, are, and will be all now's. When we understand the temporal modification at each now between the past and the future in a knot form, we can explain the identity of the same 'I's on different planes of now. I belong to myself, yet I don't belong to myself. This act of self-observation generates 'space' in itself. For example, in the diagram of the trefoil model of time-consciousness, the 'space' between the point 'o' and the point 's' which are the same present moment is not explicable with the model of paralleled planes of 'now.' This space between I and not-I is explainable through the links and their diagrams of the knots, because \"links and their diagrams encode three dimensional manifolds\" (Kauffman 1995, 111). The process of self-perception is always three-fold, which creates three-dimensional space.6 Conclusion 4. Time-consciousness is spatially constituted and perceived. Seeing myself, i.e. locating myself (objectively) necessarily requires a third person view-point, even if it is after all only 'I' who plays the third person role by observing myself in the 'not-I' position. Self-observation is the process of self-othering. As the necessary relation of the mutuality and self-mutuality logic in the Borromean rings and the trefoil knot, self-consciousness, which is subjective, is always, at the same time, intersubjective, for the intention of my self-perception is based on and points at my othered self. In this sense, the perception of my self-consciousness takes place simultaneously with my perception of not-self and vice versa.

Power of Gesture, Grammatical Intuition and Phenomenology of Space, Basel: Birkhäuser-Springer Hye Young Kim, IJN, ENS hye.young.kim@ens.fr 23 | P a g e Conclusion 5. The phenomenon of the necessary inter-relation of the consciousness of self and the consciousness of the other is visualized, i.e. zur Erscheinung kommen, in knots and their links as seen above, because \"knots and links form a calculus that is inherently self-referential and mutual\" (Kauffman 1995, 112). Music And now why music? Because music is the most intuitive but at the same most analyzable way of our understanding of time. Once I wrote that we listen to music like this:7 Figure 39 But, in fact, this is how we 'listen' at each moment: Figure 40 We hear the flow, but we listen to each moment as a whole. Each moment of music not only comprises the whole music but itself is the whole music. The note A then, the note B now, and the note C afterwards become one in the moment, creating space where they are interwoven as in the Borromean rings. Another important aspect of music lies in the relationship between the performer and the listener of the music. This always includes the self-mutual relationship because the performer is always a listener too. The performer and the listener mutually belong together at each moment of music. This is a temporal unity, but one which is always spatial because of the distance between the performer and the listener. For a performer, either as solo or with other performers, performing music is the process of creating and experiencing each moment as a whole, where the whole universe falls into the present moment. This experience is not explained through the theory of successive notes and the flow of the melody, but it is 'creating' each moment as a whole, where the (spatial) movement of my body turns into one note, and each 7 Kim, Hye Young. \"Music as Medium of Time-Consciousness: Augustine, Husserl, and Heidegger.\" Glimpse.

This paper raises new problems for the closest thing to a uniform analysis in the literature (Stalnaker 1975) and develops a new theory which solves them. I also show that this new analysis provides an improved treatment of three much-discussed phenomena (the import-export equivalence, reverse Sobel-sequences and disjunctive antecedents). While these results concern central issues in the study of conditionals, broader themes in the philosophy of language and formal semantics are also engaged here. This new analysis exploits a dynamic conception of meaning where the meaning of a symbol is its potential to change an agent's mental state (or the state of a conversation) rather than being the symbol's content (e.g. the proposition it expresses). The analysis of conditionals is also built on the idea that the contrast between subjunctive and indicative conditionals parallels a contrast between revising and consistently extending some body of information. Key words: Conditionals, Dynamic Semantics, Meaning, Logic 1 Introduction English conditionals can be distinguished into two basic classes. Some, like (2), mix past tense marking in the antecedent with a modal in the consequent. Others, like (1), lack this combination. 1 Email: will.starr@cornell.edu. URL: http://williamstarr.net. 1 The indicative and subjunctive labels are flawed, but ubiquitous. (1) and (2) are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather paradigmatic lists. I will not propose an analysis of habitual (Bob dances if Leland dances) or future (Bob will dance if Leland dances) indicatives. These require an independent analysis of habituals and future tense, which are more complex than simple past and present tenses, with a (1) a. If Bob danced, Leland danced ('Indicative') b. If Bob is dancing, Leland is dancing (2) a. If Bob had danced, Leland would have danced ('Subjunctive') b. If Bob had danced, Leland might have danced c. If Bob had danced, Leland could have danced d. If Bob danced, Leland would dance e. If Bob were to dance, Leland would dance This seemingly subtle linguistic difference allows these two kinds of conditionals to be used differently. Only subjunctives can be used counterfactually : (2a)-(2e), unlike (1a) and (1b), can be felicitously used even when it is mutual information among the conversationalists that Bob never danced and never will. This difference appears to be a basic one. It survives even in languages which lack tense morphology. For example, the tenseless language Kalaallisut forms all conditionals using hypothetical subordinate mood in the antecedent but in counterfactuals includes an additional particle in both clauses expressing 'remote modality' (Bittner 2011). Further subdivisions exist and require explanation, but it is this basic distinction that is investigated here. Any semantic theory of conditionals must ultimately deliver a uniform analysis of the two species. That is, it must ascribe the same meanings to the constituents they share, e.g. if, and derive their semantic commonalities from these meanings. Further, it must explain their semantic differences in terms of the meaning of the constituents they do not share. This is just to accept a minimal version of compositionality and the fact that the two species share constituents which are not mere homonyms. 2 Despite the immense attention conditionals have received, there theory that comes the closest to delivering this result: Stalnaker (1968, 1975). In this paper I raise three problems for this attempt at uniformity and propose a new uniform theory that solves them. This improved theory builds on the analysis of indicative conditionals developed in Starr (2013a) and Gillies (2009), which already has important advantages over Stalnaker's (1975). I will also show that the compositional explausible analysis of conditionals. Kaufmann (2005) takes up this project. 2 The cross-linguistic distribution of conditional particles indicates that they are not homonymous. Another obvious but unappreciated mark against homonymy was pointed out to me by Tom Donaldson: there isn't a subjunctive reading of (1) or an indicative reading of (2). W. Starr ⁄⁄  tension to subjunctives proposed here offers analyses of three phenomena that are problematic for Stalnaker (1968) and Lewis (1973): the validity of importexport, disjunctive antecedents (Fine 1975) and reverse Sobel sequences (von Fintel 2001; Gillies 2007) (§4 introduces these phenomena). There is, however, a broader narrative here that connects three more general themes in the philosophy of language. The prominent semantic difference between indicative and subjunctive conditionals seems to parallel two different doxastic processes: a consistent extension versus a revision of an agent's beliefs. 3 This parallel is a promising way to align work on the semantics of conditionals with work in epistemology and the philosophy of science on inference and inquiry. 4 Why seek such alignment? Leibniz, Boole, Frege and others established the idea of language as an epistemic tool, and conditionals inhabit a special place in this conception. One can infer B from A and B if A. So whatever accepting a conditional amounts to, it should at least cohere with a rational policy for inferring B from A. Extending this correspondence to natural language seems appropriate, since the basic inference of modus ponens is as central as there is in any formal language. It therefore seems not only appropriate to connect our studies of natural language conditionals and our theories of belief change, it seems necessary to explain how natural language does what it does. Connecting belief change and conditionals leads to a yet more difficult question. Subjunctive conditionals are the standard medium for stating and reasoning about a certain kind of dependence in the world around us, e.g. if the light switch were up, the light would be on. But what is it about the world (and us) that makes this capacity so powerful? As Goodman (1947) detailed, the question of what it takes to make a subjunctive conditional true is difficult enough, without also saying why these kinds of truths are particularly powerful. The Lewis-Stalnaker semantics intentionally avoids Goodman's question and focuses instead on a logical question (Stalnaker 1968: §I): what patterns of inference govern subjunctive conditionals? They showed that it is possible to state constraints on subjunctive truth-conditions that are strong enough to 3 Many authors have explored this idea. See van Rooy (2006: §5.6). 4 The latter work draws a distinction between imaging and conditionalization (e.g. Lewis 1975; Gärdenfors 1982) or belief revision and belief update (e.g. Katsuno & Mendelzon 1992). W. Starr ⁄⁄  make interesting predictions about their logical behavior, but too weak to engage Goodman's difficulties. 5 This feature of the theory can be obscured when Lewis and Stalnaker say that the truth of a subjunctive conditional depends on the relative similarity of different possible worlds. But the constraints on similarity they require are far less demanding than ordinary similarity, as they have mentioned in response to critics. 6 So while their logical constraints happen to partially characterize ordinary similarity, they make no claim that ordinary similarity is actually involved in the truth or evaluation of subjunctive conditionals. Filling out an account of similarity or even constructing the similarity function needed to make a particular conditional true confronts what they are trying to avoid: Goodman's problems (Thomason 2007). Their claim is that a relation similar to similarity captures the logic of subjunctive conditionals. It certainly seems possible to contend that this conservativism mitigates the explanatory depth of their semantics, but it should be uncontroversial that Goodman's question remains a deep and unanswered one. I wish to join Thomason (2007: 2) in expressing optimism that new methods from artificial intelligence will help with Goodman's problems. This is no accident, since Goodman's problems parallel one of AI's signature puzzles: the frame problem. 7 In my opinion, Pearl's (2000) work on causal modeling is the most suitable for developing a semantics of subjunctive conditionals. While I pursue that project elsewhere, it is relevant to this paper as well. Any semantics built on the causal modeling approach will be variably-strict and many authors have objected that this gives the wrong logic for subjunctive conditionals. These arguments were those mentioned earlier concerning the validity of import-export, disjunctive antecedents and reverse Sobel sequences. Since the theory developed here addresses these arguments while giving a variably5 These constraints are detailed in Definition 16, Appendix A.1. 6 E.g. Stalnaker (1984: Ch.7) and Lewis (1979a). 7 Consider a robot with a model of its environment who can perform actions which change that environment. How does the robot decide what has changed and what hasn't? (McCarthy & Hayes 1969) Striking the match usually leads to fire. But sometimes not. The match could be wet, the striking surface could be too smooth or there could be too little oxygen or too much wind, or the robot could have confused a twig for a match. Where does this list end? The robot will also need a list of the things that don't change! Goodman observed: it seems to be true that if the match had been struck, it would have lit. But it doesn't light under any number of conditions and listing them without circularity is non-trivial. See Shanahan (2009). W. Starr ⁄⁄  strict analysis of subjunctives, it is an important piece of a theory which meets Goodman's problems head on. The third theme in the philosophy of language relevant here is a particular debate about the nature of linguistic meaning. Everyone agrees that as a conversation unfolds the conversationalists' information changes. But there is a debate about how our knowledge of linguistic meaning (semantics) and general purpose rationality (pragmatics) conspire to make this happen. Classical semantics proposes that our linguistic knowledge allows us to pick out a piece of information with a sentence, and our pragmatic competence tells us how that information should change our existing information. Dynamic semantics proposes that our linguistic knowledge directly encodes routines for changing information. Pragmatics still plays an enormous role in communication, since other changes can be inferred on the basis of how the sentence has changed the shared information. The uniform theory of conditionals proposed here employs a dynamic semantics, which is introduced in §3.1. The argument in favor of dynamic semantics here (§3.6) is interestingly different from those given elsewhere. Other arguments focus on how utterances of sentences change the conversationalists' shared information (e.g. Kamp 1981; Heim 1982; Groenendijk et al. 1996). The debate then centers on whether a classical conception of informational content and pragmatic information uptake can capture these changes (e.g. Stalnaker 1998; Lewis 2012; Dekker 2012). This can give the mistaken impression that the debate over dynamic semantics is simply a debate about the division of labor between semantics and pragmatics. The dynamic perspective on logical consequence and communication is important here, but the most important role played by dynamic meanings is in delivering an adequate compositional semantics. Without a dynamic semantics it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to give a semantics to the if... then... structure and the unique morphology in subjunctive conditionals which captures the difference between indicatives and subjunctives, and produces an attractive logic. Here is the route which connects these themes and a uniform theory of conditionals. My first goal will be to show that a uniform analysis which parallels the consistent extension/revision contrast is the best explanation of some key contrasts between the two kinds of conditionals (§2.1). After advancing a hypothesis about the linguistic encoding of this distinction (§2.2), I argue that the leading attempt at a uniform analysis (Stalnaker 1968, 1975) fails in several crucial ways (§2.3). These difficulties are solved by the new analysis proposed W. Starr ⁄⁄  in §3. That analysis takes the dynamic semantics for indicative conditionals advanced in Gillies (2009) and Starr (2013a) and transforms it into a uniform theory of conditionals that explains the basic contrasts between the two varieties by paralleling the extension/revision contrast. On this theory, the antecedents of indicative and subjunctive conditionals propose different hypothetical changes to the information at stake in a conversation or inquiry. To explicitly encode this difference in the semantics of conditionals, it is necessary to construe the meanings of antecedents dynamically: in terms of their potential to change a body of information rather than in terms of their (contribution to) truth-conditions. The paper concludes by showing that the analysis of subjunctives offered here counts as a variably-strict one in the tradition of Stalnaker (1968) and Lewis (1973) and how it it remedies some serious obstacles for such an analysis. The paper also ends with a qualification of the idea that the kind of revision at work in subjunctive conditionals is likely not the same process by which we revise our beliefs after discovering they are wrong. There are a few ideas from the philosophy of language that will be essential in what follows. As inquiry and conversation proceed, a body of information accumulates. Think of this information as what the agents are taking for granted in some way. A convenient model of this information can be stated in terms of a set of possible worlds (Stalnaker 1978: 86). Like information, this set distinguishes ways the world might be (possibilities in the set) from ways it isn't (possibilities excluded from the set). Call this set c, short for contextual possibilities or contextual information. Grice, Lewis, Stalnaker and others view this information as what is mutually taken for granted. 8 This is how I will understand c. However, in §3.2 I will depart from the idea that c is the only information that evolves as linguistic activities unfold. 2 Stalnaker's Uniform Analysis One of the most basic contrasts between indicative and subjunctive conditionals is illustrated in (3) and (4). 8 Not only are the agents taking this information for granted, but they are all taking for granted that they are taking it for granted, and taking that for granted, etc. (Lewis 1969, 1979b; Stalnaker 1999, 2002; Clark 1996; Fagin et al. 1995: Ch.4). W. Starr ⁄⁄  (3) # Bob never danced. If Bob danced, Leland danced. (4) Bob never danced. If Bob had danced, Leland would have danced. In both (3) and (4) the conditionals are interpreted against the information that precedes them. The indicative is anomalous when its antecedent is used to talk about a scenario incompatible with that information, unlike the subjunctive. This contrast suggests a hypothesis: indicative conditionals must be used to explore consistent extensions of a given body of information while subjunctive ones may be used to explore revisions of that body of information. (3) and (4) are not the only data to be accounted for by a uniform theory of conditionals. The assertion of a subjunctive conditional often suggests something an ordinary indicative does not: 9 The Subjunctive Suggestion Assertions of if Bob had danced, Leland would have danced often suggest that Bob didn't dance. The reality of this suggestion is evidenced by the oddity of (5). (5) # Bob danced. If Bob had danced, Leland would have danced. What is the source and status of this 'suggestion'? It is not an entailment and it is not a presupposition. (6) If Jones had taken the arsenic, he would have just exactly those symptoms which he does in fact show (Anderson 1951: 37) (7) If the butler had done it, we would have found blood on the kitchen knife. The knife was clean; therefore, the butler did not do it. (Stalnaker 1975: 71) In (6) the subjunctive conditional is used as an argument for the antecedent and so cannot be construed as presupposing or entailing the antecedent's falsity. (7) is a premise in a non-circular argument for the falsity of its antecedent and so cannot presuppose it. Since the second premise is ineliminable the subjunctive cannot alone entail the falsity of the antecedent. These examples make clear that there is no general 'suggestion of falsity' for subjunctive conditionals. 9 I'll be a monkey's uncle if Bob dances more than suggests that Bob won't dance. W. Starr ⁄⁄  2.1 Stalnaker's Distinction So, however this suggestion is tied to the conventional meaning of subjunctives, it needs to be weaker than a suggestion of flat out falsity. 2.1 Stalnaker's Distinction Stalnaker's (1975: §3) way of drawing the indicative/subjunctive distinction sheds light on the phenomena described above. Stalnaker's Distinction An indicative conditional focuses solely on antecedentworlds among the contextually live possibilities c, which represent what's being taken for granted in the discourse. A subjunctive conditional focuses on antecedent-worlds that need not be among those possibilities, that is they may be counterfactual from the perspective of the discourse. (Stalnaker 1975: §3) As Stalnaker (1975: 69) puts it \"the idea [for indicative conditionals] is that when a speaker says if A, then everything he is presupposing to hold in the actual situation is presupposed to hold in the hypothetical situation in which A is true.\" Subjunctive antecedents, on the other hand, signal that in saying if A the speaker may be suspending some presuppositions and reaching beyond the contextually live possibilities (Stalnaker 1975: 70). Stalnaker does not discuss the Subjunctive Suggestion, but the following explanation suggests itself. The choice between using a subjunctive and an indicative is the choice between a form that allows antecedent worlds from outside the contextual possibilities and a form which does not. Why would the speaker select the subjunctive instead of the indicative form? Because they wanted to allow antecedent worlds from outside c. Why would they want to do that? Either they think some antecedent worlds are outside c or they shouldn't presuppose that the speaker thinks that all of the antecedent worlds are in c. The former kind of explanation correlates with contexts in which the Subjunctive Suggestion arises, while the latter correlates with contexts where it doesn't but a kind of neutrality about the possibility of the antecedent is desired, e.g. (6). This kind of abductive interpretation is familiar from other work in pragmatics (Hobbs et al. 1993), and explains why the Subjunctive Suggestion is both defeasible and a default. It is often the strongest assumption consistent with the context, but that can change either after more information comes in or when other information makes a weaker explanation more plausible. While W. Starr ⁄⁄  2.1 Stalnaker's Distinction further work is necessary to properly formulate this proposal, its basic shape and promise is clear enough for present purposes. The focus here will be its semantic assumption: indicatives require antecedents within c, subjunctives do not. While I think this a plausible interpretation of Stalnaker, I will be considering the view on its explanatory merits alone. 10 Consider how Stalnaker's Distinction bears on (3) and (4). (3) # Bob never danced. But, if Bob danced, Leland danced. (4) Bob never danced. But, if Bob had danced, Leland would have danced. In (3) the indicative conditional is being interpreted against presuppositions which are incompatible with Bob's having danced. But in uttering an indicative conditional a speaker is talking about a situation where those presuppositions hold and Bob danced. Since there is no such situation, this will yield a defective utterance - just as it is defective to utter My sister is running when it is common ground that I don't have a sister. By contrast, in (4) a speaker is talking about a situation where the presuppositions may be suspended, so there may indeed be a situation satisfying the constraints communicated by the speaker's utterance. Lastly, Stalnaker's Distinction clearly connects the two species to two different ways of combining information. Indicatives involve combining two consistent bodies of information (the antecedent and c), while subjunctives involve combining two bodies of information that may very well be inconsistent (the antecedent and c). 10 von Fintel (1999b) proposes a similar view where subjunctives presuppose that the space of worlds relevant for evaluating the antecedent are not a subset of c. As he notes, none of his data distinguishes this from the Stalnakerian view. Leahy (2011) proposes that indicatives presuppose the epistemic possibility of their antecedent, that subjunctives have no presuppositions and derives the Subjunctive Suggestion as an 'antipresupposition' using an epistemic logic. There seem to be counterexamples to this claim about indicatives: \"I know that Bob danced. But I'm happy to humor you and consider the possibility that he didn't. If he didn't dance, Leland didn't dance either.\" Since the Leahy (2011) approach truly requires this assumption, I'm inclined to the abductive approach sketched above. W. Starr ⁄⁄  2.2 The Ingredients of a Subjunctive Antecedent 2.2 The Ingredients of a Subjunctive Antecedent How is Stalnaker's Distinction linguistically encoded? To begin answering this question, I will attend to one prominent feature of subjunctive antecedents: they are marked with past tense morphology. 11 (8) a. If Bob had danced, Leland would have danced b. If Bob were to dance, Leland would dance c. If Bob danced, Leland would dance Surprisingly, this morphology does not have a genuinely past tense meaning. Out of context, the default reading of (8a) may very well concern a possibly counterfactual past event of Bob dancing. But, the antecedent may be coherently supplemented with tomorrow to yield an antecedent that concerns a possibly counterfactual future event. (9) Bob died yesterday. If he had died tomorrow instead, he would have been 98 years old. As evidenced by (11), this is not possible for a genuinely past tense reading of Bob had died, like that in (10). (10) Yesterday I went to the Black Lodge. By the time I got there, Bob had died, but Cooper hadn't. (11) I will go to the Black Lodge tomorrow. # By the time I get there, Bob had died, but Cooper hadn't. Thus, the past tense marking in subjunctive antecedents does not have a genuine past tense interpretation. 12 This phenomenon is relevant to contrasting 11 More specifically, the auxiliaries in the antecedents of (8a) and (8b) are marked with what looks like past tense, and the same goes for the main verb in the antecedent of (8c). When multiple tenses are layered as in (8a) and (8b), the tense on the auxiliary determines the overall tense of the sentence. The acceptability of perfective sentences like By tomorrow, Bob will have danced makes this clear. Otherwise, such a sentence would be as unacceptable as #Bob danced tomorrow. 12 Parallel examples for (8a) and (8b) are available (Iatridou 2000). With subjunctives like (8b) there is the additional difference that even with singular subjects the plural conjugation is used. In isolation Bob were to dance is ungrammatical, though W. Starr ⁄⁄  2.2 The Ingredients of a Subjunctive Antecedent indicative and subjunctive conditionals since it does not occur in the former. (12) # If Bob danced tomorrow, Leland danced tomorrow At this point, three observations have accumulated. First, Stalnaker's Distinction: an indicative is concerned solely with antecedent-worlds among the contextually live possibilities while a subjunctive concerns possibly counterfactual antecedent-worlds. Second, the past tense morphology in the antecedents of subjunctive conditionals does not have its usual past tense meaning. Third, the past tense marking of indicative conditionals does have its usual past tense meaning. The contrast highlighted by the second and third observations offers a possible explanation of how Stalnaker's Distinction is linguistically encoded: Counterfactuality Hypothesis The seemingly past tense morphology in the antecedents of subjunctive conditionals serves a modal function rather than a temporal one. It locates the antecedent event among a set of possibilities that may contain counterfactual ones, i.e. ones that may not be among the contextually live possibilities. Past tense morphology serves a purely temporal function in indicative antecedents, and so indicative antecedents remain concerned with the live contextual possibilities. (Isard 1974; Lyons 1977; Iatridou 2000) The basic idea is that these three observations are nicely explained by assuming a modal interpretation of past tense morphology in the antecedents of subjunctives gives rise to Stalnaker's Distinction. Any account of how subjunctive conditionals are put together must account for the fact that past tense morphology does not receive its normal temporal interpretation in subjunctive conditionals, but does in the antecedents of indicatives. Stalnaker's Distinction delineates a modal difference between these two kinds of antecedents. Both points are unified by the hypothesis that this past tense morphology takes on a modal interpretation. More specifically, instead of locating the antecedent event, e.g. Bob's dancing, in the past, it locates that event in a possibly counterfactual situation. There are a number of ways one might explain how past tense morphology alternates between these two interpretations. Though this is an important part of this semantics, it is not my focus here. The goal here is to formulate the analysis generally enough to be compatible with numerous acThe men were (supposed) to dance is acceptable. The latter sentence exhibits the same 'fake past' pattern in that it allows tomorrow, yesterday and today. W. Starr ⁄⁄  2.2 The Ingredients of a Subjunctive Antecedent counts of these linguistic details. Indeed, my analysis will be general enough to cohere with a more nuanced approach proposed by Schulz (2007: §6.4). Schulz proposes that in simple past subjunctives, past tense morphology can be interpreted modally (what she calls subjunctive mood). However, in past perfect subjunctives past tense can be semantically vacuous, in which case have contributes a slightly different modal meaning (what she calls counterfactual mood). Schulz motivates this hypothesis with a wider set of data than considered here and formulates a fully compositional analysis based on it. There is much to recommend this analysis, but its differences with the Iatridou-style analysis are not relevant here. Accordingly, I will introduce a modal operator \u0001 called counterfactual expansion to model the modal contribution characteristic to subjunctive antecedents, leaving open the possibility of refining this operator further to parallel Schulz's subjunctive (Schulz 2007: 236) and counterfactual (Schulz 2007: 240) moods. This simplification, as well as the simplified semantics of \u0001, will facilitate easier comparison with existing approaches. On my approach, a simple subjunctive conditional will be represented as (if \u0001p) q and the corresponding indicative as (if p) q. The question is how the semantics of (if * ) * and \u0001 can be given to yield a uniform analysis of conditionals. I will begin by evaluating whether or not Stalnaker's proposal can provide a satisfactory answer to these questions. After arguing that it cannot, I will propose a semantics for \u0001 and combine it with the semantics for indicatives offered in Starr (2013a) and Gillies (2009) to yield a uniform analysis of conditionals. For simplicity, \u0001 will be modeled as a specialized sentential operator. Though, it is admittedly representing the contribution of something that is not really a sentential operator. Neither have or past tense take scope over fully-formed sentences, nor sentences of arbitrary complexity. Respecting this will require some seemingly arbitrary stipulations about the syntax of \u0001 (see Appendix). A more detailed model with a syntactically richer representation language and a deeper investigation into the scopal properties of \u0001 is needed. Consider this, then, a first-approximation. Before moving on it is worth acknowledging a tradition of analysis which attempts to give a standard past tense meaning to subjunctive antecedents after all (Skyrms 1974; Adams 1975a; Dudman 1981, 1983, 1984, 1988; Ippolito 2003; Arregui 2007, 2009). The basic idea is that the past tense in subjunctive antecedents scopes over the modal meaning: when I say if Bob had danced tomorrow I'm talking about what used to be possible, namely a future in which Bob danced. On this view, a subjunctive is a report about a past possibility. W. Starr ⁄⁄  2.3 A First Attempt at Uniformity: Stalnaker (1975) As von Fintel (2012: §7) notes, this view seems prima facie unable to account for examples like If you had bet heads, you would have won. This conditional seems true when a coin has been tossed and ha come up heads. Yet, at no point prior were the (closest) worlds where you bet heads necessarily ones where you won (see Adams 1975a: Ch.4 for related objections). One should also worry about how the theory would apply to a language like Kalaallisut that distinguishes the two varieties with a morpheme lacking temporal content (Bittner 2011: 35). 13 Since Schulz (2007: §6.4) is able to capture all of the data used to motivate this real-past view, there is little that can be said quickly about the choice between them (though see Schulz 2007: §6.2.2). I do, however, wish to comment on Ippolito's (2003: 149-50) claim that an Iatridoustyle analysis is incapable of capturing examples like (9). The concern is that one of the two past tense morphemes will still have a past tense meaning, which should conflict with tomorrow. However, it is open to Iatridou to hold that both past tense morphemes receive a modal interpretation and that \u0001\u0001p is equivalent to \u0001p. A Schulz-style analysis also captures these examples. With this issue addressed and some motivations for a modal analysis of subjunctive antecedents aired, I turn to the semantics of modal antecedents. 2.3 A First Attempt at Uniformity: Stalnaker (1975) Stalnaker (1968, 1975) provided one of the earliest and most successful attempts at a uniform analysis of conditionals. 14 This analysis treats (if * ) * in terms of a two-place sentential connective >, whose semantics is given in (13). Stalnakerian Semantics for Both Species (13) a. φ > ψ is true at w if and only if ψ is true at all of the φ-worlds most similar to w b. Jφ > ψKc,f = {w | f(w, JφKc,f ) ⊆ JψKc,f} The set selection function f takes a world w and a proposition p and delivers 13 See also Van linden & Verstraete (2008: §4) who suggest that even tensed languages commonly use non-temporal morphology to mark subjunctive antecedents. Murray (p.c.) also informs me that Cheyenne uses identical tense/aspect morphology in indicative and subjunctive antecedents, but a distinct hypothetical mood for the two. 14 See Nolan (2003) and Williams (2008) for related approaches. W. Starr ⁄⁄  2.3 A First Attempt at Uniformity: Stalnaker (1975) the set of p-worlds most similar to w. 15 This selection must obey some basic constraints (see Appendix) but must be further determined by context. Stalnaker's core idea is that the assertion of an indicative conditional is interpreted with a further selection constraint. Given a set c of contextual possibilities, he requires that \"if the conditional is being evaluated at a world in [c], then the world[s] selected must, if possible, be within [c] as well\" (Stalnaker 1975: 69). The idea is that in evaluating an indicative conditional at a world compatible with what's being taken for granted (represented by c), the selection of antecedent worlds should preserve what's taken for granted. Stalnaker (1975) does not specify exactly which proposition results from this constraint, but says merely that if w ∈ c then f(w, JφKc,f ) ⊆ c (Stalnaker 1975: 69). How can this remark be used to provide such a specification? When given a proposition p, f selects p-worlds. The formal theory captures this by requiring that f(w, p) ⊆ p. Stalnaker's constraint can therefore be met by requiring that if w ∈ c, the conditional is evaluated not by considering f(w, JφKc,f ) but rather by considering f(w, JφKc,f∩c). But this does not yet fully specify a proposition. What happens with worlds not in c? It is natural to assume that in this case the constraint does not apply, so f operates as in (13b). Stalnaker's proposal then seems to be that while the semantic content of an indicative conditional is given by (13), the assertion of an indicative in a context will express (14). Stalnakerian Pragmatics for Indicatives (14) a. φ > ψ is true in c at w iff: (i) If w ∈ c, ψ is true at all of the φ-worlds in c most similar to w (ii) If w /∈ c, ψ is simply true at all of the φ-worlds which are most similar to w b. Jφ > ψKc,f = {w | f(w, JφKc,f ∩ c) ⊆ JψKc,f if w ∈ c & f(w, JφKc,f ) ⊆ JψKc,f if w /∈ c} Unfortunately, (14) does not embody Stalnaker's Distinction. Recall that ac15 Stalnaker makes the uniqueness assumption: for all w and p there is at most one p-world most similar to w. The above remains neutral on this matter by universally quantifying over a set of the most similar worlds, be it a singleton or more populous set. Throughout, I will translate Stalnaker's discussion of f into a setting that does not assume uniqueness. W. Starr ⁄⁄  2.3 A First Attempt at Uniformity: Stalnaker (1975) cording to Stalnaker's Distinction an indicative conditional makes a claim only about antecedent worlds within c. (14) is importantly different. It mentions two kinds of antecedent worlds, those within c – f(w, JφK∩ c) – and those that may be outside of c – f(w, JφK). So on this theory, indicative conditionals do not just concern antecedent worlds within c. But this distinction was supposed to explain the two contrasts between indicatives and subjunctives discussed at the beginning of §2. Perhaps Stalnaker didn't intend (14), but rather (15), as Nolan (2003: 218) and Williams (2008: 212) propose. (15) a. φ > ψ is true at w iff ψ is true at all of the contextually live φ-worlds most similar to w b. Jφ > ψKc,f = {w | f(w, JφKc,f ∩ c) ⊆ JψKc,f} On this version, the constraint applies both to worlds in c and worlds outside of c. It is unlikely that Stalnaker, who stated his constraint conditionally meant it to apply unconditionally. And for good reason. The conditional proposition in (15) does not obey modus ponens. Consider a w /∈ c where φ ∧ ¬ψ is true, and further that ψ is true at all of the φ-worlds in c that are most similar to w (i.e. f(w, JφKc,f ∩ c) ⊆ JψKc,f ). Then the assertion of an indicative φ > ψ will express a proposition that is true in w, yet w is a world where φ is true and ψ is false! 16 So Stalnaker's analysis either can't explain the contrasts that are the subject of my investigation or it leads to incorrect truth-conditions. There is a proposition that could serve as the content of an indicative conditional assertion that obeys modus ponens and Stalnaker's Distinction: (16) Jφ > ψKc,f = {w ∈ c | f(w, JφKc,f ) ⊆ JψKc,f} Only antecedent-worlds from within c are of concern to this proposition and it is false outside c. This saves modus ponens, but has worrisome consequences. First, (16) cannot be derived from a restriction on the selection function. The 16 Nolan (2003: 222-3) suggests requiring c to be knowledge helps, but at least within Stalnaker's view where the context set is a set of worlds rather than an accessibility relation, this does not help. All this guarantees is that the actual world won't provide the counterexample to modus ponens, which is no consolation. Further this conversationally unrealistic requirement would vitiate nearly all of the explanatory applications of Stalnaker's framework. Lycan (2001) chooses to give up and reject modus ponens. In the theory proposed below, neither concession is necessary. W. Starr ⁄⁄  2.3 A First Attempt at Uniformity: Stalnaker (1975) constraint would have to apply generally and therefore make all assertions be about worlds in c. But then this approach would mistakenly apply the same constraint to subjunctive conditionals. It is worth reminding oneself here that it is not plausible to say that indicatives and subjunctives express the same proposition, but differ just presuppositionally: uttering an indicative presupposes the contextual possibility of the antecedent. This option is foreclosed by the familiar point that conditionals of the two species can differ in truth value in the same context: if Oswald hadn't killed Kennedy, someone else would have vs. if Oswald didn't kill Kennedy, someone else did. Further, it gives up Stalnaker's Distinction and so the explanations which led us to seek a semantics that embodies that distinction. The foregoing highlights problematic details in Stalnaker's analysis which have not been worked out. But I sympathize with the reservation that these problems of detail are not enough alone to reject the only uniform analysis we have. However, I will now connect this discussion with that of §2.2 to raise a more basic problem for Stalnaker's analysis. This problem, taken together with the new uniform analysis in §3 which is free of both problems, presents a strong challenge to the Stalnaker (1975) analysis. Stalnaker (1975) gives a single semantic clause for both indicative and subjunctive conditionals, namely (13). However, he takes the assertion of an indicative conditional to be subject to a 'pragmatic constraint' on the selection function. This constraint entails that the assertion of an indicative conditional expresses an importantly different proposition, namely that listed in (14). Here is Stalnaker's clearest statement of the approach: Both kinds of conditionals. . . have the same abstract semantics, but a contextdependent parameter of the interpretation - the selection function - is differently constrained by the different grammatical constructions. So, on this theory, the difference between the two kinds of conditionals is a semantic difference in two different senses, but a purely pragmatic difference in a third sense. The difference is semantic, first in the sense that there will normally be a difference in the proposition expressed by the contrasting conditional sentences, even when uttered in similar situations. And it is semantic also in the sense that the difference is marked by a conventional linguistic device (the tense/aspect/mood difference). But the distinction is pragmatic in that the device works by the way it constrains W. Starr ⁄⁄  2.3 A First Attempt at Uniformity: Stalnaker (1975) features of the context. The semantic rule that gives the truth conditions of the conditional as a function of the contextual parameter will be the same for both kinds of conditionals (Stalnaker 2005: n.13). The constraint is said to be pragmatic in the sense that it applies to features of the context. But it is hard to say why, in the modern sense, this is pragmatic (as opposed to Montague's 1970 sense). Pronouns require a salient referent. Past tense requires a salient past event. Indexical pronouns require a salient conversationalist. These facts about how words draw on context do not count as pragmatic in the Gricean sense. They do not follow from basic truths about the rational and cooperative nature of the conversationalists. These are facts about the constant function of particular morpheme. As such, they belong to compositional semantics. 17 Why, then, did Stalnaker (1975) not propose a meaning for the subjunctive mood and construe the different propositions expressed by subjunctive and indicative conditionals as a function of this mood's contribution? Once it is recalled what the mood's contribution was, it becomes clear that the difference between subjunctive and indicative propositions cannot be derived from this contribution and Stalnaker's semantics for the if... then... structure. As I discussed in §2.2, subjunctive mood seems to be encoded using the apparent past tense, or the perfect have, in the antecedent of subjunctives. Its job is to allow subjunctives to access worlds outside c. Yet, Stalnaker's semantic clause for if... then... already allows antecedent worlds outside c! He tries to limit indicatives to antecedent-worlds in c by placing a special constraint on them. But, from the perspective of morphology and compositional semantics, this is backwards. The semantic clause for if... then... should be limited to antecedent worlds in c unless the antecedent contains a morpheme that allows it to expand beyond c. It is only a theory of this form that can correctly correlate the linguistic differences with the semantic differences between the two kinds of conditionals. Just such a theory will be sketched in the following section. 17 Stalnaker's 'pragmatic' constraint would have to apply sub-sententially: If Bob is dancing, then Laura would be dancing if she were here. W. Starr ⁄⁄  3 A New Uniform Analysis Stalnaker's approach to conditionals takes the meaning of a sentence to be its truth-conditions. In sketching an alternative, I will begin by describing the more general perspective on meaning that has come to be known as dynamic semantics. After stating a semantics for all if...then... structures in this framework, I will provide a semantics for the \u0001 operator proposed in §2.2. This will allow me to explain the contrasts between indicative and subjunctive conditionals, as well as the subjunctive suggestion, discussed in §2. 3.1 Dynamic Semantics From a dynamic perspective, the meaning of a sentence is the characteristic role it plays in linguistic activities (conversation, calculation, inquiry, thought, etc.). On the Stalnakerian model of these activities, their progress is captured by an evolving body of mutual information, c. So the characteristic role a sentence plays can be stated as a function from one body of information to another. This takes the form of an equation c[φ] = c′, where the difference between c and c′ is the characteristic effect utterances of φ have on any body of information c. 18 (Read c[φ] as 'c updated with φ'.) To be sure, actual particular utterances of φ may have many other, sometimes eclipsing, effects. But this equation is supposed to capture the common contribution the linguistic item makes to those utterances. For a basic illustration of this framework and formulation of a conditional semantics, it is convenient to consider a simple propositional logic with the familiar syntax, starting with a set of atomic sentences At = {p0, p1, . . .}, and forming conjunctions, disjunctions and negations from them. A possible world can be treated as a valuation, i.e. an assignment of one truth-value, either 1 (True) or 0 (False), to every atomic sentence. The meanings of sentences are specified in the format discussed above: Definition 1 (Update Semantics) (1) c[p] = {w ∈ c | w(p) = 1} (2) c[¬φ] = c− c[φ] (3) c[φ ∧ ψ] = (c[φ])[ψ] (4) c[φ ∨ ψ] = c[φ] ∪ c[ψ] Atomic sentences eliminate any possibilities incompatible with their truth. 18 [φ] is a function which applies to c and delivers c′. Although the notation [φ](c) seems more appropriate, I will follow precedent. (Veltman 1996) W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.1 Dynamic Semantics Negation eliminates all possibilities compatible with its scope. A conjunction updates c with the first conjunct and then updates the resulting information with the second conjunct. Disjunction separately updates c with each of its disjuncts and forms their union. To be sure, these clauses look different from the corresponding clauses of a non-dynamic possible worlds semantics. But it turns out those non-dynamic clauses are a consequence of Definition 1, provided one has a suitable definition of truth in the dynamic system. While many dynamic semanticists focus on another concept called support, truth can be seen as a special case of support (Starr 2010). Definition 2 (Support, Truth in w) (1) Support c \u000f φ⇔ c[φ] = c (2) Truth in w w \u000f φ⇔ {w}[φ] = {w} Sometimes the information provided by a sentence is already contained in c (explicitly, or implicitly), in which case c is said to support that sentence in the sense that an assertion of that sentence would be supported by c. 19 Being true at a world just amounts to being supported by perfect information about that world. After all, if one were to have perfect information about w, and the information provided by φ was already contained in that information, φ must correspond to the facts in w. Since support is taken to be the key semantic concept, entailment is typically defined in terms of support, rather than truth. Definition 3 (Entailment v1) φ1, . . . , φn \u000f ψ ⇔ ∀c : c[φ1] * * * [φn] \u000f ψ The basic idea is that if incrementally adding φ1, . . . , φn to any state of information results in a state that supports ψ, then φ1, . . . , φn entail ψ. Interestingly, if this definition is restricted to states of perfect information (singleton sets of worlds), classical entailment results. With truth now defined, propositions are also easily defined: Definition 4 (Propositional Content) JφK = {w | w \u000f φ} As previously mentioned, Definitions 1 and 4 yield as corollaries the clauses of 19 The present model does not distinguish implicit and explicit information, i.e. information agents have immediate access to versus information they could access by communication or thought. Models that make this distinction exist but introduce unnecessary complications here (Fagin et al. 1995: Ch.9). W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.2 Conditional Semantics standard possible worlds semantics: Corollary 1 (Possible Worlds Semantics) (1) JpK = {w ∈ W | w(p) = 1} (2) J¬φK = W − JφK (3) Jφ ∧ ψK = JφK ∩ JψK (4) JφK ∪ JψK = JφK ∪ JψK However, the dynamic semantics is not yet more powerful or general. One could have started with the possible worlds semantics and derived the update semantics as a corollary by using the following as a definition of update: Stalnaker's Pragmatic Update Equation c[φ] = c ∩ JφK Indeed, Stalnaker (1978: 86-7) proposed that this equation captures a necessary pragmatic consequence of successful assertions. One way to argue for a dynamic semantics is to find a sentence whose meaning does not seem to obey this equation. This disobedient behavior could involve a non-eliminative update, i.e. one where c[φ] * c. Or, it could involve an update that does not amount to intersecting c with JφK, but rather some other proposition. 20 Both kinds of argument can be (and usually are) challenged by offering an alternative pragmatic account of the non-eliminative update or by offering a more nuanced theory of the proposition expressed by φ, perhaps one involving context-sensitivity. I shall provide a different kind of argument below. First, that argument will be about a sub-sentential context update and is therefore less plausibly rebutted with a pragmatic explanation. Second, that argument appeals to constraints of compositionality more than expressive limits of static meanings. This argument will be detailed in §3.6. 3.2 Conditional Semantics Update semantics allows one to state meanings that do not take the familiar form of adding information to c. One example is a test, and my proposal 20 This way of stating the dialectic uses the properties of eliminativity and continuity often discussed in the context of dynamic semantics (van Benthem 1986, 1991; Groenendijk et al. 1996; van Benthem et al. 2011). Rothschild & Yalcin (2013) have shown that idempotence and commutativity provide a more general characterization of the updates that don't obey the equation above. This development leads to the same basic debate with different properties guiding it. It is therefore equally orthogonal to the kind of argument for dynamic semantics provided below. W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.2 Conditional Semantics is that conditional meanings are of this kind. Instead of eliminating worlds meeting some condition, tests check whether the existing information has a particular feature. If it does not, failure results: a transition to the state of absurd information, ∅. Passing the test permits the existing information to proceed unchanged. A first approximation of the conditional semantics helps to illustrate this idea: Definition 5 (Conditional Semantics, v1) c[(if φ)ψ] =  c if c[φ] \u000f ψ ∅ otherwise According to this definition, a conditional tests whether the background information c, together with the antecedent, supports the consequent. This is a close relative of the strict conditional theory first proposed by Lewis (1914): the consequent is a necessary consequence of the antecedent. However, there are three new twists. First, the necessity is restricted to the worlds in c. Second, the kind of consequence at stake is dynamic: the consequent provides no new information when one has the information c[φ]. Third, by using a dynamic notion of consequence and attending to the presuppositions of indicative conditionals, this theory provides a logic of conditionals that is far more plausible than Lewis (1914). While Starr (2013a) argues at length that this logic has a reasonable claim to being the best available, I will summarize that argument below. This summary will motivate modified versions of Definitions 3 and 5 which reflect the presuppositional features of indicative conditionals. The material conditional validates the following suspect forms of reasoning. (17) Material Antecedent (MA) ¬φ \u000f φ ⊃ ψ Bob didn't dance. So, if Bob danced, he was a turnip. Material Negation (MN) ¬(φ ⊃ ψ) \u000f φ It's not true that if God exists, he's a turnip. So, God exists. Stalnaker (1968, 1975) and Adams (1975b) propose theories that invalidate (17), but at the cost of invalidating the plausible patterns of reasoning in (18): (18) Import-Export φ1 → (φ2 → ψ) \u000f \u000f (φ1 ∧ φ2)→ ψ Antecedent Strengthening φ1 → ψ \u000f (φ1 ∧ φ2)→ ψ W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.2 Conditional Semantics Disjunctive Antecedents (φ1 ∨ φ2)→ ψ \u000f (φ1 → ψ) ∧ (φ2 → ψ) Transitivity φ1 → φ2, φ2 → ψ \u000f φ1 → ψ Contraposition φ→ ψ \u000f ¬ψ → ¬φ Adams and Stalnaker attempt to justify this by offering counterexamples to the last four patterns in (18). 21 However, upon further inspection, all of these attempted counterexamples involve the evaluation of an indicative conditional in a context where its presupposition is not met (Gillies 2009: §7, Starr 2013a). They involve the evaluation of an indicative conditional in a context where the antecedent is taken to be impossible. 22 Yet, indicative conditionals clearly presuppose that their antecedents are possible: (19) Sue never smoked. # If she smoked, she didn't run. This opens the door for an analysis that renders valid all the patterns in (18) and gives a principled explanation of the cases where those patterns breakdown. As long as it also has something to say about MA and MN, it seems quite clear that such an analysis would count as giving the best logic or natural language indicative conditionals. This kind of analysis requires two modifications to that given above: a semantics that reflects the presuppositions of indicative conditionals and a definition of consequence that does not count cases of presupposition failure against an inference pattern. Both modifications are easily articulated in update semantics where presuppositions can be treated as definedness conditions on updates (Heim 1982). For present purposes, this amounts to modifying the conditional semantics from Definition 5 as follows. Definition 6 (Conditional Semantics, v2) c[(if φ)ψ] =  c if c[φ] 6= ∅ & c[φ] \u000f ψ ∅ if c[φ] 6= ∅ & c[φ] 2 ψ Undefined otherwise Strawsonian consequence (von Fintel 1999a; Starr 2013a) provides just the sort 21 Adams (1975b: §1.8) doubts Import-Export. But even his sympathizers are unmoved: McGee (1989) and Bennett (2003: §40) who calls this pattern if-and. 22 Veltman (1986) and Warmbrōd (1981b, 1983) make this observation but propose pragmatic views about the kind of infelicity that results. W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.3 Conditionals as Tests of consequence related needed here. On this understanding of consequence, one only considers contexts where an update with the premises followed by the conclusion are defined. This is a small modification of Definition 3: Definition 7 (Entailment v2) φ1, . . . , φn \u000f ψ ⇔ ∀c∗ : c∗[φ1] * * * [φn] \u000f ψ • c∗ is any context s.t. c[φ1] * * * [φn][ψ] is defined. This analysis quite clearly invalidates MN, but it is not obvious that it makes the correct predictions about MA and other patterns, like ψ \u000f (if φ)ψ and ψ \u000f ¬((if φ)¬ψ). I think these issues can be quite compellingly addressed, but I leave that to Starr (2013a). It might be thought that this approach to the logic of indicative conditionals is a bad fit for the project of this paper: a uniform theory of conditionals. First, the conditional semantics seems to encode something particular to indicative conditionals (their presupposition) into the basic conditional form. Second, it is a strict conditional theory, but I suggested in the introduction that one wants a variably-strict semantics for subjunctive conditionals. In §3.4 I will show that an appropriate semantics for \u0001 neutralizes this presupposition and yields a variably-strict semantics for subjunctives. Before that, I would like to conclude this section with a more detailed discussion of the proposal that conditionals express tests in an update semantics. 3.3 Conditionals as Tests According to the semantics in Definitions 5 and 6, the conditional does not do its job in communication or inquiry by asserting the proposition that the antecedent plus the background information supports the consequent. Accepting the conditional and moving on in inquiry does signal that this condition holds, but in a different way. The fact that it cannot be seen as the assertion of a conditional proposition is clear when one considers what proposition a conditional does express on the proposed semantics (recall Definition 4). A world w is in J(if φ)ψK if updating {w} with that conditional returns {w}. On the present semantics that will occur when {w}[φ] \u000f ψ. On both versions of the semantics, this happens if w is a φ ∧ ψ-world. On the version without presupposition, this also happens if w is a ¬φ-world. 23 So on the version without presupposition, the proposition expressed by a conditional is the material 23 In this case: {w}[φ] = ∅ and since ∅[ψ] = ∅, ∅ \u000f ψ. Hence {w}[φ] \u000f ψ. W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.3 Conditionals as Tests conditional: J(if φ)ψK = J¬φ ∨ ψK. On the version with presupposition, the proposition will be undefined when w is a ¬φ-world. So the best one gets is partial-truth conditions: (if φ)ψ is true when φ∧ψ is true, false when φ∧¬φ is true and undefined otherwise. 24 However one works out the idea of a partial proposition, neither version obeys Stalnaker's Pragmatic Update Equation: c[(if φ)ψ] 6= c ∩ J(if φ)ψK. Suppose c contains one φ ∧ ¬ψ-world w1 and one φ∧ ψ-world w2. The assertion of (if φ)ψ performs a test which fails for this c, and so c[(if φ)ψ] = ∅, while c∩ J(if φ)ψK = {w2}. It is worth noting, as Gillies (2009) does, that there is a context-sensitive assignment of propositions to sentences that satisfies this equation: Static Strict Conditional J(if φ)ψKc = {w ∈ c | c ∩ JφKc ⊆ JψKc∩JφKc} The proposition this conditional expresses is either c or ∅, depending on whether or not the antecedent taken together with c classically entails the consequent (when interpreted against that augmentation of c). Accordingly, a pragmatic update of this proposition by intersection with c will behave exactly like the dynamic conditional: as a test. Strictly speaking, this preserves the idea of the conditional expressing a proposition, but it does not fit with the static idea that one makes assertions by expressing propositions and felicitous assertions must provide some information, i.e. eliminate at least one world from c (see Stalnaker 1978: 88). I think this makes a static semantics a bad fit for the kind of strict-conditional semantics proposed here, but it also highlights a very natural question about any test semantics for conditionals. Don't successful utterances of them often provide information? How can a test semantics capture this? (20) seems to illustrate that a conditional can be used to eliminate φ ∧ ¬ψ-worlds from c. (20) (Context : I'm hosting a party and you've been mingling widely.) Me: I'm trying to find guests without drinks. Is Ulysses here? You: I don't know. But he's quite a lush, so if he is here, he has a drink. Me: # That's an absurd thing to say! Nothing we've said so far rules out him being here without a drink! 24 There is a long history of authors who have endorsed these truth-conditions but failed combine it with a plausible logic. Starr (2013a) argues that this is an additional interest of the present semantics. W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.3 Conditionals as Tests It is my second utterance in (20) that seems absurd! Doesn't the test view predict that this absurd response should be reasonable? As stated, the test view is indeed incomplete, but it is still promising. Perhaps some uses of conditionals, like clarifications, target mutual information c. But it seems more common for them to target other bodies of information, like the speaker's own beliefs, common knowledge or information possessed by other salient individuals. So it seems that an update semantics should not limit its view to c. Nonetheless, these alternative bodies of information are still constrained by c. One cannot just target any bodies of information, but only those which are presupposed to exist. For example, it is presupposed that the speaker has some private beliefs is but since it is not mutual information what all these beliefs are, c and is may differ. On this view, conditionals are interpreted from the perspective of c, but not always with respect to c. There is a set of bodies of information which c makes available: Ic = {c, i0, . . . , in}. 25 Here is the most conservative way of integrating this idea with the conditional semantics above. Read the c in the semantics not as mutual information, but rather as some member i (or members) of Ic, and leave it up to pragmatics to discern how testing these bodies of information could impact what is mutually taken for granted. It is not so hard to see how this pragmatic story would go. Assuming the speaker is being cooperative and rational, they will be speaking about an i that is relevant and accessible to them. In this case, it is natural to allow the indicated properties of i to be mirrored in c. By asserting the conditional in (20), you thereby proposed to have a particular property mirrored in the mutual information, namely that it lacks worlds where Ulysses is here without a drink. And thus tests can lead to an increase in the mutual information. Less conservative ways of integrating Ic with the above semantics is to actually change the semantics. One can continue to outsource the link between an i and c to pragmatics, or explicitly require it: Conditionals in an Information Network (Two Options) a. c[(if φ)ψ] = {w ∈ c | ∃i ∈ Ic : i[φ] \u000f ψ} b. c[(if φ)ψ] = {w ∈ c | ∃i ∈ Ic : i[φ] \u000f ψ & c[φ] \u000f ψ} On the latter semantics, even though the test imposed by (if φ)ψ would fail, it is clear that the absurd state is not the intended result. Instead, the intended result was the minimal modification of c needed to make it have the indicated 25 For a similar view see von Fintel & Gillies (2011: §4). W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.4 The Semantics of Counterfactual Expansion \u0001 feature of i. In (20), this is the elimination of worlds where Ulysses is at the party but not drinking. I will not take a stand on which of these approaches is best, though it is discussed more in Starr (2013a). It might be objected that this is an awfully complicated way of communicating. But the complications add a flexibility and power which we know natural language has, and more traditional, proposition-based views lack. The speaker's utterance can achieve its intended effect without specifying exactly which body of information lacks φ ∧ ¬ψ-worlds. On a traditional view where the conditional expresses a proposition about some body of information, one cannot know what was communicated by the conditional until one knows which body of information it was about. Furthermore, the effect of aligning c and i would not happen just by the acceptance of the proposition that i lacked φ ∧ ¬ψworlds. Pragmatic reasoning parallel to that which supports the test semantics would be needed anyway. 3.4 The Semantics of Counterfactual Expansion \u0001 My aim is to formulate a semantics of conditionals that obeys Stalnaker's Distinction, which says that the antecedent of a subjunctive conditional concerns worlds that may not be among c, while an indicative conditional concerns worlds that are among c. The indicative conditional semantics from §3.2 has the later feature: only φ-worlds in c are considered in evaluating (if φ)ψ. §2.2 claimed that the antecedent of a subjunctive a modal element \u0001. So the next step is to formulate a semantics for \u0001 that allows (if \u0001α)ψ to consider α-worlds that may not be among c. My proposal is this: What \u0001α Does Given c, \u0001α returns a set of α-worlds c′. • If w ∈ c is an α-world, then w ∈ c′. • If w isn't an α-world, one or more alternative α-worlds are placed in c′. These alternatives may or may not be selected from c. Previous semantic analyses of subjunctive conditionals provide different methods for selecting alternative α-worlds. For example, the popular similarity analysis developed by Stalnaker (1968) and Lewis (1973) suggests that they are the α-worlds most similar to w. 26 Premise semantics, developed by Veltman 26 This formulation makes the limit assumption which Lewis (1973: §1.4) officially rejected: there is a set of α-worlds most similar to w. Though some reasons for adoptW. Starr ⁄⁄  3.4 The Semantics of Counterfactual Expansion \u0001 (1985, 2005) and Kratzer (1989), and Pearl's (1996) structural equation semantics provide a different account that requires looking 'inside' w and seeing how reversing α's falsity would produce a different world or worlds. While my preference is for something like the later approaches (Starr 2013b), the dividing issues do not directly impact the project of defining a \u0001 operator with the behavior sketched above. The more familiar Lewis-Stalnaker analysis will suffice. The simplest and most direct formulation of the similarity analysis uses a selection function f , which takes a world w and a proposition p, and returns the set of p-worlds most similar to w. Selection functions are required to meet some basic constraints. Stalnaker required (a)-(d) and Lewis (a)-(c). 27 Definition 8 (Selection Functions) (Let p, p′ ⊆ W and w ∈ W ) (a) f(w, p) ⊆ p success (b) f(w, p) = {w}, if w ∈ p strong centering (c) f(w, p) ⊆ p′ & f(w, p′) ⊆ p =⇒ f(w, p) = f(w, p′) uniformity (d) f(w, p) contains at most one world uniqueness Selection functions can be added to the framework of update semantics sketched above by taking sentences to operate on a pair consisting of a set of worlds c and a selection function f , though for convenience I will write cf and talk as though this were the set c. The semantics for \u0001 can then be stated as follows: Definition 9 (Counterfactual Expansion \u0001) Let f be a selection function: cf [\u0001α] = {w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, JαK)}f • \u0001α returns worlds which are among the α-worlds closest to some w ∈ c How does this semantics ensure the behavior described above? The first feature was that \u0001α keeps the α-worlds from c. This is secured by the strong centering ing it exist, it's a mere convenience here (Pollock 1976; Herzberger 1979; Warmbrōd 1982; Stalnaker 1984: 140-6). 27 Again, I am putting aside the limit assumption. Stalnaker formulates the selection function as returning a single world rather than a singleton set. That implementation requires contortions (undefinedness or an impossible world) when evaluating f(w,∅), while the set selection formulation (Lewis 1973: §3.4) can just return ∅. W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.4 The Semantics of Counterfactual Expansion \u0001 constraint. 28 Consider any α-world wα from c. Strong centering requires that wα be the closest α-world: f(wα, JαK) = {wα}. So wα is among the α-worlds closest to some world in c, namely itself. The second feature of the analysis is that \u0001α replaces each ¬α-world w¬α in c with the α-worlds closest to w¬α, f(w¬α, JαK), and that these worlds may not be among c. Definitions 8 and 10 indeed leave open whether these worlds are in c. So these worlds may not be in c. Indeed, given the minimal constraints place on f , for any assertion of a subjunctive conditional, there will most likely be a compatible f that selects some α-worlds outside of c. While I have just shown that \u0001 has the basic desired features, there is a feature of the analysis that deserves careful consideration. Recall that \u0001 corresponds to a modal interpretation of a past tense morpheme. For this reason, when we represent a subjunctive like (21) the antecedent should come out as \u0001B∧\u0001L. On the other hand, the antecedent of (22) is plausibly rendered as \u0001(D ∧ S). (21) If Bobby had danced and Leo had drank, Bobby would have danced (22) If Bobby had danced and sung, he would have danced (21) is so obviously true, that it is strange to assert. Indeed, it seems to instantiate a plausible logical validity: Preservation \u000f (if φ ∧ ψ)φ ∧ (if φ ∧ ψ)ψ Yet, the current analysis allows the left conjunct to be false when its antecedent contains \u0001. Conjunction is sequential update, so (21)'s antecedent comes to: (cf [\u0001B])[\u0001L]. This involves first finding the B-worlds closest to worlds in c, and then finding the L-worlds closest to those B-worlds. The problem is that at this second step f allows closest L-worlds which are not B-worlds. For any B ∧ ¬L-worlds that were in c, f will find the closest L-worlds. But these may be outside of c, and so they may not be B-worlds. Thus, there will be cf 's for which (cf [\u0001B])[\u0001L] contains ¬B-worlds. But then there will be cf 's for which (cf [\u0001B])[\u0001L] 2 B. But then (if \u0001B ∧\u0001L)B is not logically valid. The cause of this result should be obvious: instead of using f once to find the closest B ∧ Lworlds, f is being used once to find the closest B-worlds and then again to find the L-worlds closest to those B-worlds. This issue surfaces in another way in the Lewis-Stalnaker analysis. There, conjunctive antecedents are not problematic 28 Weak centering would do as well: w ∈ f(w, p) if w ∈ p. W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.4 The Semantics of Counterfactual Expansion \u0001 because they are assimilated to \u0001(A ∧ B). The problem instead arises with nested conditionals. The eminently plausible principle of Import-Export fails because in the nested conditional φ2 > ψ f is free to select ¬φ1-worlds. Yet, in the conjunctive antecedent, f is required by Success to select φ1-worlds. Import-Export (if φ1) ((if φ2)ψ) \u000f \u000f (if φ1 ∧ φ2)ψ The present analysis validates Import-Export, but the issue re-emerges with Preservation. There are three possible responses to this issue I can imagine. The first is to defend the thesis that all conjunctive antecedents have the form \u0001(α ∧ β), but this is just to ignore the linguistic details that led to the postulation of \u0001 in the first place. The second option is to allow \u0001α to shift the assignment function to f JαK which requires future uses in the antecedent to select α-worlds. This option has much to recommend it, and is the approach taken in Starr (2010: Ch.3). However, I have since realized that it leads to a failure of modus ponens when subjunctives are nested in the consequent of a subjunctive, e.g. (if \u0001A) ((if \u0001B)C) and A won't entail (if \u0001B)C. The reason is that \u0001A would shift f , but A would not. It cannot, since otherwise you couldn't have non-vacuous counterfactuals: after accepting ¬A, \u0001A would be forced to look for ¬A ∧\u0001A-worlds! On the shifting approach if A is true in w, then (if \u0001A) ((if \u0001B)C) would require that all the B-worlds closest to w according to f JAK are C-worlds. These closest worlds would all have to be A ∧ B-worlds. However, unembedded, (if \u0001B)C will be evaluated with respect to f , which will require that the B-worlds closest to w according to f are C-worlds. The difference is that these needn't all be A ∧ B-worlds. Indeed, f can select a ¬A ∧ B ∧ ¬C-world. Since there are no genuine counterexamples to modus ponens, I regard this response as a dead-end. 29 The third possibility is to deny Preservation. This position gains support from examples like this: (23) Context : We see something off in the distance rummaging in a garbage bin. We agree it's a dog. I'm fond of pointing out how ecologically sound dogs indiscriminating dietary habits are. 29 The McGee (1985) 'counterexamples' to modus ponens are easily diagnosed and diffused on the dynamic semantics for conditionals described in §3.2 (Gillies 2004: 592-5). The similar subjunctive case from Briggs (2012: §3.1) only arises in a structural equations framework, e.g. Pearl (2000: Ch.7). Since that is my preferred analysis of f , it is fortunate that my version of the structural equations semantics circumvents this problem by rendering the complex subjunctive false (Starr 2012). W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.4 The Semantics of Counterfactual Expansion \u0001 a. If that dog were human, it would eat even more garbage. b. [You take out your binoculars.] No way, look, it is a human! c. Okay, well, if it were a dog and that dog were a human, then it would eat even more garbage. Consider the consequent of (23c). It is clear that when we come around to evaluating this claim, the envisioned creature is not a dog, but rather a dogturned-human. After all, you would miss my point if you construed me as saying some dog would eat more garbage. Accordingly, it seems like this instance of Preservation is false in the context of (23): (24) If it were a dog and that dog were human, then it would be a dog This failure of Preservation has a specific feature: there is no world where both antecedents are true. In this case, it would seem that the second antecedent wins out. After all, it is at least clear that (25) sounds better than (24). (25) If it were a dog and that dog were human, then it would be human This is what the current semantics predicts: Right Preservation \u000f (if \u0001α ∧\u0001β) β No Left Preservation 2 (if \u0001α ∧\u0001β)α But there is still a story to be told about the cases where Left Preservation seems plausible. Those are cases where adopting β doesn't force you to give up α. Redefining f in a way that builds on the following idea seems promising: when evaluating \u0001α you preserve any truths that don't depend on the falsity of α. The structural equations approach I favor is an example of such an approach (Pearl 2000; Starr 2013b). In this setting, \u0001β will only take you to ¬α-worlds from an α-world if α's truth depended on β being false, e.g. if α is 'Side A of the teeter-totter is up' and β is 'Side B of the teeter-totter is up'. If f had this feature, a restricted version of Left Preservation would hold: Limited Left Preservation If ∃w \u000f α ∧ β, then ∀cf : cf \u000f (if \u0001α ∧\u0001β) β While I spell out the details of this approach to subjunctives in Starr (2013b), what I've said here should suffice to show that there is a workable alternative to either giving up modus ponens, misrepresenting subjunctive antecedents by W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.5 Unification giving \u0001 wide scope or misrepresenting subjunctive antecedents by leaving out \u0001 altogether. I grant that the natural language examples bearing on Preservation are nuanced, but given how implausible the alternatives are, I believe this nuanced data adequately motivates the position I have just described. 3.5 Unification The semantics for conditionals offered in §3.2 was originally proposed for indicative conditionals, but when combined with the semantics for \u0001 from §3.4 it yields a plausible semantics for subjunctive conditionals too. This is not immediately obvious, since indicative conditionals were assumed to presuppose that their antecedent was compatible with c and this is not at all plausible for subjunctive conditionals. However, by plugging a subjunctive antecedent into that semantics, it becomes clear that this feature does not pose a problem. (26) cf [(if \u0001α)ψ] =  cf if cf [\u0001α] 6= ∅f & cf [\u0001α] \u000f ψ ∅ if cf [\u0001α] 6= ∅f & cf [\u0001α] 2 ψ Undefined otherwise An indicative would presuppose that cf [α] 6= ∅f , but a subjunctive has a different antecedent and so a different presupposition too: cf [\u0001α] 6= ∅f . This presupposition can be met even when there are no α-worlds in cf . As long as f can find an α-world similar to one of the ¬α-worlds in cf , cf [\u0001α] 6= ∅. Subjunctive Visibility Presupposition • (if \u0001α)ψ presupposes that for some w ∈ cf , f(w, JαK) 6= ∅. • (if \u0001α)ψ presupposes that an α-world is visible from cf . Conditionals with antecedents like \u0001(α ∧ ¬α) will therefore be infelicitous, which seems at least as reasonable as rendering them vacuously true. This uniform analysis embodies Stalnaker's Distinction (§2.1) perfectly. Indicative conditionals concern only the antecedent worlds within c, while subjunctives concern antecedent worlds that may lie outside of c. This is because it is always true that cf [A] ⊆ c, but for certain cf 's, cf [\u0001A] * c. Embodying this distinction allows the present theory to explain the indicative and subjunctive contrasts discussed in §2 while validating modus ponens and tying W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.5 Unification these contrasts to the specific linguistic differences between the two varieties of conditionals. The present theory, unlike Stalnaker's Distinction alone, helps explain the oddity of (27). (27) # Bob always danced. If Bob had danced, Leland would have danced. The first sentence limits the live possibilities to ones where Bob danced. The second sentence, according to Stalnaker's Distinction, suggests that some relevant Bob dancing-worlds may be beyond these live possibilities. But the current theory predicts that what the subjunctive actually asserts is at odds with this suggestion. After updating with the first sentence cf [B], only B-worlds remain. However, in this context the antecedent of the subjunctive \u0001B will only concern those live B-worlds. Why? By Centering, cf [B][\u0001B] = cf [B]. So selecting the subjunctive form in (27) suggests that some of the relevant Bworlds may be counterfactual (outside cf [B]), and it goes on to say that none of them are counterfactual and that they are all L-worlds. While this is not a fully rigorous explanation, it illustrates that there is a clear tension on which a more detailed explanation could be based. This uniform semantics amounts to an analysis which may have initially seemed impossible. It provides a strict analysis of indicative conditionals, but a variablystrict analysis of subjunctive conditionals. However, it does so with the same meaning for the if...then... structure. An indicative (if α)ψ says that ¬α ∨ ψ holds throughout c. But a subjunctive (if \u0001α)ψ says that ¬α∨ψ holds throughout c[\u0001α]. In this sense, the set of worlds over which a subjunctive expresses a necessity varies depending on which antecedent is being considered. Hence, it is variably-strict. Logically, this difference impacts two inference patterns. Antecedent Strengthening (if \u0001α)ψ \u000f (if \u0001α ∧\u0001β)ψ Transitivity (if \u0001α1)α2, (if \u0001α2)ψ \u000f (if \u0001α1)ψ W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.5 Unification Strict analyses validate both while variably-strict analyses validate neither. 30 Antecedent Strengthening is indeed invalid on the present semantics. This pattern fails precisely because \u0001α2 may expand beyond the initially closest α1-worlds, and these may not be ψ-worlds. The failure of transitivity stems from the fact that it might be that (i) when you expand cf with α1 you only get α2-worlds and (ii) when you expand cf with α2 you only get ψ-worlds, but (iii) when you expand cf with α1 you get only ψ-worlds. Just consider an everyday light controlled by two binary switches. The light is on just in case the two switches are not in the same position. In the actual world, switch 1 is down, 2 is up and the light is on. In the minimally different world where switch 1 is up, 2 should remain up. The minimally different world where switch 2 is up is the actual world and the light is on. Yet, it does not follow that the minimally different world where switch 1 is up is a world where the light is on. Indeed, that is a world where both switches are up so the light is off. With this said, it is quite natural to interpret sequences of conditionals in a different way that leads to Transitivity sounding plausible. Rather than interpreting the second conditional with respect to cf , it is natural to hear it as elaborating on the α2-worlds mentioned by the consequent of the first conditional. In this case, the second conditional is interpreted with respect to cf [\u0001α1][α2]. So, \u0001α2 will just (by Strong Centering) give us back that same set of worlds, so if all of them are ψ-worlds, it would have to follow that all of the worlds in cf [\u0001α1] are ψ worlds. In that case, (if \u0001α1)ψ will follow. Weak Transitivity is valid: Weak Transitivity (if \u0001α1)α2, (if \u0001α1) ((if \u0001α2)ψ) \u000f (if \u0001α1)ψ This method of interpreting sequences of conditionals could be thought of as modal anaphora: one conditional sets up one set of possibilities and the subsequent one elaborates on it. While this is a prominent way of interpreting conditionals, it is not the way of connecting claims target by the dynamic no30 Some strict accounts of subjunctive conditionals invalidate these patterns, but in a very specific case (e.g. Gillies 2007; von Fintel 2001). They rely on a case where the presuppositions of the premise are met but the conclusion's are not and cannot be accommodated. Thus, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion (and hence isn't dynamically valid either). However, the Strawsonian definition of entailment motivated in §3.2 does not count cases like this for or against an inference pattern. On this definition any strict analysis will validate Antecedent Strengthening and Transitivity. By contrast, on my semantics these patterns aren't even valid in the Strawsonian sense. W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.5 Unification tion of logical consequence. Logical consequence is simply sequentially taking in the information semantically provided by each premise. While there is often more to understanding the structure of a discourse, one might think this additional structure is more appropriately handled in the pragmatic analysis of discourse. In §4.2 I will articulate one benefit of thinking this way and spell out formally how a pragmatic analysis of discourse structure could capture what is going on in Transitivity inferences that sound correct. There is a prominent, and positive, difference between the proposed logic of subjunctives and the Lewis-Stalnaker analysis. This concerns subjunctives with disjunctive antecedents, and will be discussed in §4.1. Indicative and subjunctive conditionals can diverge in their truth-conditions. Since indicative conditionals are truth-valueless in worlds where their antecedents are false (§3.2), this had better be true on the proposed analysis. As mentioned earlier in this section, subjunctives still have a presupposition about the truth of their antecedent, but it is much weaker: (if \u0001α)ψ presupposes that for some w ∈ cf , f(w, JαK) 6= ∅. This difference has an important consequence for the truth-conditions of subjunctives. While indicative conditional propositions are rarely defined (unless their antecedent is a tautology), subjunctive propositions are routinely defined, provided an f is employed which can find an α-world most similar to any given world. This follows from the definitions of truth and propositions from §3.1 and the semantics for subjunctive conditionals proposed above. Fact 1 (Simple Subjunctive Conditional Propositions) For non-conditional, non-modal ψ: (1) J(if \u0001α)ψKf is well-defined if ∀w ∈ W , f(w, JαK) 6= ∅ (2) When defined, J(if \u0001α)ψKf = {w | f(w, JαK) ⊆ JψKf} The second part of this fact makes clear that on the present analysis subjunctive conditionals have the same truth-conditions as on the original LewisStalnaker account. This certainly makes clear that the truth-conditions of indicative and subjunctive conditionals are predicted to diverge on the present analysis, but it does not really capture the difference between (28a) and (28b) noted by Adams (1975b), and others following him. (28) a. If Oswald didn't kill Kennedy, someone else did b. If Oswald hadn't killed Kennedy, someone else would have W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.5 Unification Adams says that (28a) is clearly true, but that, putting aside a massive conspiracy, (28b) is not. On the present analysis, (28a) is only true if, in the actual world Oswald didn't kill Kennedy and someone else did. But the subjunctive would also be true, since f is assumed to obey Strong Centering. However, it is clear in the case Adams is describing, we are to evaluate the conditionals in a state of uncertainty. We know that Kennedy was murdered, and we think that Oswald probably killed Kennedy, but there's a slight chance he didn't. (28a) then says that in all of these worlds where Oswald didn't kill Kennedy, someone else did, since in all of those worlds Kennedy was murdered. This is captured on the present analysis not by talking about the truth of (28a) but about the fact that the context, as set up by our cultural knowledge, supports the indicative conditional. By contrast, (28b) requires something far stronger to be supported by the context. Like the indicative, it requires that someone else killed Kennedy in all of the live worlds where Oswald didn't. But it also requires that for each live world where Oswald did kill Kennedy, the most similar world where Oswald didn't commit this murder, someone else would have carried it out in his stead. Clearly any f which does not observe the opinions of conspiracy theorists will lead to (28b) not being supported. The final topic I wish to mention is the fact that the present analysis does not, so far, explicitly represent the contribution of the modals that appear in the consequent of subjunctive conditionals. As it turns out, this is harmless for would conditionals. Would is standardly analyzed to be a combination of a necessity modal woll with past tense (will being woll plus future tense). But the same data that led us to believe that the past tense in antecedents does not receive a genuinely past tense meaning also applies to the past tense component of would. (29) If I were to run a marathon tomorrow, my sister would congratulate me afterwards In (29) it is clear that the congratulations is not only in the future of the utterance time, but also in the future of the marathon running. Thus, it cannot be that the past tense component of would is contributing a real past tense meaning. So I propose to analyze would in terms of a combination of necessity and counterfactual expansion: would A translates as \u0001 A. For , I have in mind the standard dynamic meaning for epistemic modals (Veltman 1996): W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.5 Unification Definition 10 (Necessity and Possibility 3) • cf [\u001fφ] = {w ∈ c | cf \u000f φ}f ◦ φ tests that cf entails φ • cf [3φ] = {w ∈ c | cf [φ] 6= ∅}f ◦ 3φ tests that cf is consistent with φ Sticking \u0001 under this has no real effect, assuming Strong Centering. If A holds for cf , then A is true in every world in cf . But then cf [\u0001A] = cf . So, the \u0001 doesn't really add anything. Furthermore, on the present semantics of conditionals, it can be proven that (if φ)ψ is equivalent to (if φ)\u001fψ. So it is harmless to represent a would -subjunctive as (if \u0001A)B rather than (if \u0001A)\u001f\u0001 B. It does, however, make a difference for should, could and mightsubjunctives. Adding \u0001 under 3 is not redundant. An update with 3B will fail when there are no live B-worlds in cf . However, updating with 3\u0001 B will not. This instead tests that there is at least one world in cf [\u0001B]. As long as f can find some B-world similar to one of the live ¬B-worlds, this test will be passed. So, the antecedent of (if \u0001A)3\u0001 B will temporarily shift the context to the A-worlds most similar to some live possibility. The consequent will then test that there is at least one world among these which is either a B-world, or that some world f -similar to it is a B-world. In this last step it becomes clear that (if \u0001A)3\u0001 B does not require a B-world in cf [\u0001A]: it can expand to find one when necessary. By contrast ¬(if \u0001A)\u001f\u0001 ¬B requires that there are some B-worlds in cf [\u0001A]. So (if \u0001A)3\u0001 B does not entail ¬(if \u0001A)\u001f\u0001 ¬B. However, the opposite does hold since if there are some B-worlds in cf [\u0001A], then by Strong Centering c[\u0001A][\u0001B] will contain at least those worlds and hence be non-empty. So unlike Lewis (1973), the present analysis does not validate Duality, yet unlike Stalnaker (1984: Ch.7), we are not forced to analyze might and could -subjunctives as involving a wide-scope epistemic modal. While the present approach improves on both by giving a genuinely compositional analysis of subjunctives, I regard it as still tentative. There are ways to regain Duality in the present system and a more thorough discussion of whether or not Duality is desirable is necessary, but beyond the scope of this paper. W. Starr ⁄⁄  3.6 Dynamic Semantics and Counterfactual Expansion 3.6 Dynamic Semantics and Counterfactual Expansion Why exactly did the analysis of conditionals presented above need a dynamic conception of meaning? The discussion in §§3.2 and 3.3 gave some general motivation for a dynamic analysis by illustrating that it offers an interesting and powerful perspective on logic and communicative role of conditionals. But it is unclear that those benefits are exclusive to a dynamic approach, even if they are particularly natural from that perspective. As I mentioned at the end §3.3 there is a more explicit argument that can be made for a dynamic semantics and it hinges on the semantics of \u0001. Suppose one adopted a static strict conditional semantics. Static Strict Conditional J(if φ)ψKc = {w ∈ c | c ∩ JφKc ⊆ JψKc∩JφKc} The difference between subjunctive and indicative conditionals that needs to be captured is that subjunctives allow access to antecedent worlds outside c. This difference needs to come from the semantics of \u0001, which will occur somewhere in φ. But there is a clear problem. No matter which proposition JφK turns out to be, c∩ JφK will be limited to c-worlds. So there is no propositional semantics that can be assigned to \u0001α such that (if \u0001α)ψ accesses α-worlds outside c but (if α)ψ accesses α-worlds within c. The problem is obviously that the conditional semantics itself builds in the relativization to c needed for indicative conditionals. An alternative approach is to begin with a conditional semantics that does not have this restriction: Static Strict Conditional v2 J(if φ)ψKc = {w ∈ c | JφKc ⊆ JψKJφKc} One could then claim indicatives contain an 'indicative mood operator' \u0003 such that J\u0003αKc = c ∩ JαK, while giving a semantics for \u0001α that can reach beyond c-worlds. Unfortunately, there is no morphological evidence for this indicative mood operator, let alone the cross-linguistic evidence justifying the \u0001 operator. Furthermore, as it stands the conditional propositions assigned by both static proposals here are very problematic. They are restricted to c-worlds, which means they are false everywhere outside c and never provide information when asserted in c. This sits uncomfortably with the static picture and not even (if φ)φ will come out as a logical truth. If this restriction is lifted, all conditionals become logical truths or falsities. By embracing a dynamic semantics for \u0001 one can satisfy these linguistic and logical constraints with W. Starr ⁄⁄  ease. This is a powerful consideration in its favor. 4 Disjunctive Antecedents and Reverse Sobel Sequences Here, I will use the analysis of subjunctive conditionals from §2 to shed light on two phenomena used recently to motivate a strict analysis of subjunctive conditionals: disjunctive antecedents and reverse Sobel sequences. In both cases, the discussion will have to be brief and preliminary. While the approach outlined below improves on existing ones, I will also mention some data that are not as easily explained by any existing account. 4.1 Disjunctive Antecedents Many authors have noted that the Lewis-Stalnaker semantics yields an unsatisfying analysis of subjunctive conditionals with disjunctive antecedents. 31 While the inference from (30a) to (30b) sounds impeccable, the Lewis-Stalnaker logic maintains that SDA is invalid. (30) a. If Bob had danced or Sarah had sang, Andy would have cried b. So, if Bob had danced, Andy would have cried, and if Sarah had sang, Andy would have cried Simplification of Disjunctive Antecedents (SDA) (φ1 ∨ φ2) > ψ \u000f (φ1 > ψ) ∧ (φ2 > ψ) This is not a correctable quirk, but a consequence of the basic idea behind the Lewis-Stalnaker semantics. Suppose that the most similar φ1-worlds are ψ-worlds, but the most similar φ2-worlds are ¬ψ-worlds. Since every φ1-world is a φ1 ∨ φ2-world, it follows that (φ1 ∨ φ2) > ψ. SDA would allow it to follow that φ2 > ψ, but by assumption φ2 > ¬ψ. Several responses to this problem have been explored in the literature. Some, like Nute (1975), Warmbrōd (1981a: §3) and Lycan (2001: 42-6), suggest changing or replacing the Lewis-Stalnaker semantics. Others, like Loewer (1976) and Nute (1980), try to address the problem pragmatically. As Warmbrōd (1981a) and Lycan (2001) observe, their strict-conditional accounts are by far the most 31 E.g. Fine (1975: 453-4), Nute (1975), Loewer (1976), Ellis et al. (1977). W. Starr ⁄⁄  4.1 Disjunctive Antecedents successful. Below I will show that the variably-strict analysis developed in §2 delivers an equally appealing analysis of disjunctive antecedents. On the theory advanced in §2, (30a) corresponds to (if (\u0001b ∨\u0001s)) a. The crucial point is that \u0001 occurs within each disjunct. Recall that the source of counterfactuality \u0001, has the syntax of a tense morpheme. As such, it does not take scope over compound sentences but rather attaches directly to a verb. Within a propositional formal language, the best one can do to model this is allowing \u0001 to attach to literals (atomics and negations thereof). Thus, a disjunctive antecedent does not concern the most similar b ∨ s-worlds but rather the union - that is what ∨ does - of the most similar b-worlds and the most similar s-worlds. As a result, (if (\u0001b ∨\u0001s)) a does not test that all of the most similar b ∨ s-worlds are a-worlds. Instead, it tests that among the most similar b-worlds and the most similar s-worlds there are only a-worlds. This clearly entails that the most similar b-worlds are a-worlds and that the most similar s-worlds are a-worlds, and hence that the inference in (30) is valid. Indeed, the logic that follows from the semantics in §3.5 delivers: 32 Fact 2 (SDA is Valid) For any literals α and β (if (\u0001α ∨\u0001β))ψ \u000f ((if \u0001α)ψ) ∧ ((if \u0001β)ψ) (proof in Appendix) The problem of disjunctive antecedents thereby emerges as an artifact of representing the distinct morphological components of a subjunctive conditional as a single idiomatic connective, though two concerns still need to be addressed. 33 McKay & van Inwagen (1977) have claimed that there are counterexamples to SDA, since the inference in (31) sounds suspicious. (31) a. If Spain had fought for the Axis or the Allies, she would have fought for the Axis b. # So, if Spain had fought for the Allies, she would have fought for the Axis 32 More generally, if φ1 and φ2 are formulas built up from literals embedded under \u0001 by ∨ and ∧, then (if (φ1 ∨ φ2))ψ \u000f ((if φ1)ψ) ∧ ((if φ2)ψ). 33 Another raised by Fine (1975: 453-4) is that SDA leads to Antecedent Strengthening by the substitution of equivalents in the antecedent. p and (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ ¬q) are equivalent, so from p > r, ((p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ ¬q)) > r follows by substitution of equivalents. Then by SDA (p ∧ q) > r. But \u0001p and \u0001((p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ ¬q)) are not equivalent. W. Starr ⁄⁄  4.1 Disjunctive Antecedents But as Warmbrōd (1981a: 284) notes, (31b) can be analyzed, like the alleged counterexamples discussed in §3.2, as a conditional with a failed presupposition. For (31a) to be accepted, there cannot be any accessible worlds in which Spain fought for the Allies. But then (31b) is bad because it fails to have its visibility presupposition (see §3.5) met. So embracing the validity of SDA under a Strawsonian definition of consequence is compatible with this example. This analysis is confirmed by the infelicity of (31a) after granting that Spain could have fought for the Allies: (32) Spain didn't fight on either the Allied or Axis side, but she could have ended up with the Allies. # Nevertheless, if she had fought for the Axis or the Allies, she would have fought for the Axis. Yet more evidence can be extracted from the infelicity of (33). (33) # If Spain had fought for the Axis or if Spain had fought for the Allies, she would have fought for the Axis The most plausible explanation of this is that both if -clauses carry a visibility presupposition. Presuppositions project through disjunction, so the complex antecedent has both visibility presuppositions. Since the second cannot met while making the conditional acceptable, the sentence is infelicitous. 34 This analysis of (31) may seem to be in tension with the felicity of (34b), since it clearly admits of a possibility where Spain fought for the Allies. 35 (34) a. If Spain had fought for the Axis or the Allies, she would have fought for the Axis b. If Spain had fought for the Allies, she would have been obliterated by the Axis forces in Italy 34 One might instead have the hunch that the difference between (33) and (31a) traces to the distinction between (if \u0001(α ∨ β))ψ and (if \u0001α ∨\u0001β)ψ. But recall that \u0001 is coming from either the past tense or have. So one would expect If Spain had fourth for the Axis or Spain had fought for the Allies, she would have fought for the Axis to be just as bad as (33). Though it is subtle, this conditional strikes me as at least significantly better than (33). I return to \u0001(α ∨ β) versus \u0001α ∨\u0001β shortly. 35 I thank James Shaw for raising this issue. W. Starr ⁄⁄  4.1 Disjunctive Antecedents However, this pattern can be accommodated by saying that a different f is at work in (34b) and (34a). The question is then why we can switch to a different f in (34b) but not in (31b). I believe the answer stems from the fact that (34b) occurs as an explanation of (34a) while (31b) occurs as the conclusion drawn from (31a). An inference requires f to remain constant to avoid equivocation. But explanation needed have that structure. One can easily view (34b) as explaining why an f which admits the possibility of Spain fighting for the Allies is excluded: Spain would have been obliterated. As such, (34b) should not be seen as exploiting the same selection function as (34a), but rather justifying the kind of selection function needed to make (34a) come out true. A lingering concern is that the problem of SDA has been solved by unjustifiable syntactic fiat. While (35) is predicted, (36) is not for the same reasons that Lewis and Stalnaker do not predict SDA. (35) (if \u0001A ∨\u0001B)C \u000f (if \u0001A)C ∧ (if \u0001B)C (36) (if \u0001(A ∨ B))C \u000f (if \u0001A)C ∧ (if \u0001B)C Am I just denying that disjunctive antecedents are ever represented as \u0001(A∨ B)? But surely this is a plausible representation for the conditionals in (37) where disjunction appears under \u0001. (37) a. If Kathy or Grace had attended my talk, I would have been refuted b. X : Bill saw a bear or a coyote. Y : No, if that were true, he would have taken a picture. After all, or in the antecedent of (37a) plausibly scopes under past tense and have. Modal anaphora to a disjunctive proposition seems to accomplish the same thing in (37b). It is possible, however, to render \u0001(α ∨ β) and \u0001α ∨\u0001β equivalent. One way is to adopt an alternative semantics for disjunction (Aloni 2003; Simons 2005). The basic idea is that disjunctions do not present a single disjunctive proposition, but rather a set of propositions; one for each disjunct. The \u0001 operator can then be made to distribute over each proposition in this set. This proposal is formalized in the appendix (see Definition 24 and Remark 5), where it is also proven that it renders (if \u0001(α ∨ β))ψ and (if \u0001α ∨\u0001β)ψ are equivalent. 36 However, this analysis now seems to me insufficiently general, 36 Alonso-Ovalle (2006, 2009) also presents a (more complex) analysis using alternative semantics. This analysis does not use an operator like \u0001 to apply the selection W. Starr ⁄⁄  4.1 Disjunctive Antecedents since negated conjunctions give rise to the same issue (Nute 1980: 33). 37 (38) a. If Nixon and Agnew had not both resigned, Ford would never have become President b. If Nixon had not resigned, Ford would never have become President c. If Agnew had not resigned, Ford would never have become President (39) a. If Elvis hadn't drank and smoked, he would have lived longer b. If Elvis hadn't drank, he would have lived longer c. If Elvis hadn't smoked, he would have lived longer In both cases, (b) and (c) intuitively follow from (a). In the successful analysis of narrow scope disjunctive antecedents (where \u0001 scopes under ∨), alternatives were not necessary. Why did this analysis work, and why doesn't this success extend to wide scope disjunctive antecedents (where \u0001 scopes over ∨?) The analysis worked because disjunction unions two updates, each of which has \u0001 being applied to that disjunct. Furthermore, since each antecedent in the conclusion of SDA carries a visibility presupposition, each case where \u0001 is applied to a disjunct in the premise must yield a non-empty set of worlds. However, when \u0001 takes wide scope, it does not take into account the structure of the updates induced by its scope. Instead of defining cf [\u0001α] in terms of [α], it was defined in terms of JαK. Although the latter set of worlds is determined by [α], [α] itself has more structure when α contains connectives. For example, [A ∨ B] involves merging the parallel processing of A and B. If cf [\u0001α] could be defined to exploit this kind of structure, say to apply an expansion to subupdates, I believe a general solution could be arrived at. It is tricky in the function to alternatives. It instead builds an appeal to the selection function into the basic conditional semantics. This will not lead to an adequate uniform theory of conditionals for the reasons discussed in §2.3. The lack of \u0001 and dynamic consequence in this analysis also prevents it from having a compelling response to worries about the substitution of equivalents in antecedents (see note 33). 37 Fine (2012b: 47) also voices this worry, and additionally mentions examples with existential quantification as a worry. Since many also adopt an alternative semantics for existential quantification, that additional worry is mute. Fine (2012a,b) offers a different semantics for subjunctive conditionals altogether that validates SDA. Fine (2012b: 48) sketches an inchoate version of the Warmbrōd (1981a: 284)-style reply to McKay & van Inwagen (1977) detailed above. The Fine (2012a) semantics shares many similarities to my preferred approach mentioned above (Starr 2013b), but does not integrate well into the kind of uniform theory developed here. W. Starr ⁄⁄  4.2 Reverse Sobel Sequences current setting to make this work for negation, but with additional resources it may be possible. This project is taken up in Starr (2013b) where I develop a semantics based on structural equations rather than comparative similarity. 4.2 Reverse Sobel Sequences Dynamic strict conditional analyses have been developed to explain the contrast in (40) and (41) between Sobel sequences and reverse Sobel Sequences (von Fintel 2001; Gillies 2007). (40) a. If Sophie had gone to the parade, she would have seen Pedro dance b. But of course, if Sophie had gone to the parade and been stuck behind someone tall, she would not have seen Pedro dance (41) a. If Sophie had gone to the parade and been stuck behind someone tall, she would not have seen Pedro dance b. # But of course, if Sophie had gone to the parade, she would have seen Pedro dance However, the dynamic variably-strict analysis offered here offers a different explanation of this contrast. This analysis proposes that this is an instance of modal subordination, a phenomena where modals and pronouns are interpreted against a salient body of information other than c (Roberts 1989; Frank & Kamp 1997; Stone 1999). Consider the pronoun it in (42c). (42) a. Your cabin wasn't raided by a coyote. b. But if a coyote had raided your cabin, it would've eaten your dinner. c. It would have eaten your meat first. This anaphoric element requires (42c) to be interpreted against a background where there is a coyote who entered your cabin and ate your dinner. Since (42a) eliminates any such worlds from c, c cannot be this background. A natural idea is that (42b) introduces a counterfactual set of worlds where a coyote raided your cabin and eats your dinner, call it r. The would in (42c) helps indicate that the sentence is to be interpreted against a salient set of worlds other than c. In this example, r is the only alternative. To fill out this story, it is necessary to have a model of information that explicitly encodes eligible referents for pronouns, i.e. an assignment function. But this is not necessary for W. Starr ⁄⁄  4.2 Reverse Sobel Sequences my purposes. I just wish to claim that conditionals introduce hypothetical sets of worlds other than c, and that these too are recorded in context. Adapting Kaufmann (2000), I proposed just such a theory in Starr (2011) to capture the fact that if simultaneously functions in conditionals and embedded questions. Abstracting away from the need for Cf rather than cf , the idea is that sentences do not merely operate on cf , but on a sequence consisting of cf plus additional, hypothetical states, 〈cf , 〈if ′ , * * * 〉〉. 38 The information being taken for granted cf cf [Cα][ψ] Fig. 1. The Result of a Successful Update with (if \u0001α)ψ (c) is always the leftmost element. Successfully updating with conditionals like (42a), represented (if \u0001c) d, leave cf as it was, having guaranteed that all of the most similar coyote-raiding-your-cabin worlds are coyote-ate-your-dinner worlds. However, the subordinate context cf [\u0001c][d] generated by that update remains in the output state of that update. (42c) supports this analysis, since it anaphorically targets the subordinate context. While a normal update with a subsequent sentence like (42c) targets cf , there is a different way of relating the assertion of m to the context at work here. Here, the subordinate context cf [\u0001c][d] gets tested but the result of this test has implications for cf as well. I called this kind of update Conclusion in Starr (2011), since it is akin to drawing a conclusion at the end of a line of suppositional reasoning. Such an act relates an assertion to a hypothetical body of information, but does so in a way that has implications for the information actually being taken for granted. The following definition characterizes this operation. Definition 11 (Conclusion) Where s = 〈cf , 〈c0f0 , . . . 〈c n fn〉 * * * 〉〉: s ↑ ψ = 〈{w ∈ c | 〈cnfn〉 \u000f ψ}f , 〈c 0 f0 , . . . 〈cnfn , 〈c n fn〉[ψ]〉 * * * 〉〉 38 〈cf 〉 is a state and if s is a state then 〈c′f ′ , s〉 is a state. This recursive structure allows one meaning for φ to be applied to both 〈cf , 〈c′f ′〉〉 and it's sub-state 〈c′f ′〉. This is needed for conditionals in the consequent of a conditional. W. Starr ⁄⁄  4.2 Reverse Sobel Sequences On this analysis the intuitive interpretation of (42) is s[¬c][(if \u0001c) d] ↑ m, not s[¬c][(if \u0001c) d][m]. While the latter is contradictory the former is flawless. More broadly construed, the idea is that language users track different bodies of information. The intended structure of a given discourse may relate subsequent utterances to the contextual possibilities (cf ) or the most recently introduced hypothetical possibilities (cnfn). Understanding when a speaker is relating them one way rather than another will combine linguistic cues, e.g. would, with contextual information, e.g. ¬c, and general principles of practical rationality. This general way of thinking about the structure of discourse yields a compelling account of modal subordination. I believe it also explains the contrast between Sobel sequences and their reversed counterparts. Formalized, the Sobel sequence (40) comes out as (43) and it's reversed counterpart (41) comes out as (44). (43) a. (if \u0001s) d b. (if \u0001s ∧\u0001t)¬d (44) a. (if \u0001s ∧\u0001t)¬d b. # (if \u0001s) d According to the semantics advanced above both s[(if \u0001s) d][(if \u0001s ∧\u0001t)¬d] and s[(if \u0001s ∧\u0001t)¬d][(if \u0001s) d] are consistent updates. So the semantics by itself does not account for the asymmetry. However, once an alternative structure is countenanced for discourse (44), namely s[(if \u0001s ∧\u0001t)¬d ↑ (if \u0001s) d, an alternative account is possible. The sequence of changes imposed by this structure does yield inconsistency. On this analysis, this discourse tests whether cf [\u0001s][\u0001t][¬d][\u0001s] \u000f d. cf [\u0001s] will deliver a set of s-worlds, some of which may be outside cf . cf [\u0001s][\u0001t] will refine that set to the s ∧ t-worlds. Since cf was successfully updated with (44a), these s ∧ t-worlds must be ¬d-worlds. So updating this set with ¬d has no effect. Updating this set with \u0001s will also be ineffectual, since all the worlds in that set are already s-worlds. Clearly this set does not support d since every world in it is a ¬d world. Hence, the test imposed by (44) is failed and cf is reduced to ∅, the contradictory body of information. That is why (44) is infelicitous. By contrast, (43) is consistent no matter how its discourse structure is interpreted. W. Starr ⁄⁄  4.2 Reverse Sobel Sequences There is additional support for this approach to reverse Sobel sequences. The contrast between Sobel sequences and their reversals becomes much sharper when the discourse structure is made explicit with anaphoric pronouns. (45) a. If Sophie had bought a cupcake, she would have eaten it b. But of course, if Sophie had bought it but then dropped it in the sewer, she would not have eaten it (46) a. If Sophie had bought a cupcake but then dropped it in the sewer, she would not have eaten it b. # But of course, if Sophie had bought it, she would have eaten it The occurrences of it in (45b) must be modally subordinated to the hypothetical context set up by (45). This requires a discourse structure where the sentences are not simply updated in sequence, but one like Conclusion where the second sentence targets the hypothetical context. There is a pressing question that this approach must address. If there are two potential discourse structures that can be read into reverse Sobel sequences, why do we so naturally fall into the subordination-style interpretation, particularly in cases like (41) where the alternative interpretation is felicitous? Although there are two structures that can be assigned to a discourse like (41), they are not equally plausible. When a possibility involving Sophie going to the parade is evoked and a subsequent sentence also makes reference to such a possibility, there is a strong presumption that the second sentence is commenting on the topic raised by the first. I take this to be a clear truth about the evolution of discourse, but one which only a far more sophisticated theory and discussion of discourse structure could predict. Unless there is something to explicitly defeat this presumption, it will be very difficult to assign a structure to (45) where the sentences are simply updated in sequence. But as (Moss to appear: §4) details, there are such cases. Moss imagines a case where the speaker wants to indirectly convey the information that Mary would have turned down a marriage proposal from John. (47) a. If John had proposed to Mary and she had said yes, he would have been really happy b. But if John had proposed to Mary, he would have been really unhappy W. Starr ⁄⁄  The antecedents in (47) must be about different scenarios. The second scenario of John proposing can't be one where Mary says yes. So (47b) is not being interpreted against the hypothetical possibilities set up by (47) but just the contextual possibilities. This is evidenced in the drastic failure of anaphorically linking a parallel pair of conditionals. (48) Although John was seriously considering a proposal to Mary, he didn't end up proposing. He never even bought a ring. (49) a. If John had offered Mary an engagement ring and she had said yes, he would have been really happy b. # But if John had offered it to Mary, he would have been really unhappy While (47) is a surprise for the von Fintel-Gillies theories, (49) is a surprise for Moss's approach, which is built on a generalization about when it is epistemic responsibility to utter certain sentences. The basic idea is that it is epistemically irresponsible to assert propositions that are incompatible with salient possibilities the agent cannot rule out. This disallows (41) but allows (47) since the speaker can rule out the possibility that John will proposed to Mary and she will say yes. But by the same lights, one should be able to utter (49b). Both cases can be handled by the approach here, though I must admit that more needs to be said about the theory of discourse structure before victory is declared. I simply wish to mention here that the present analysis of subjunctive conditionals plus independently motivated assumptions about the structure of discourse and modal subordination suffices to explain the phenomena of reverse Sobel sequences. 39 5 Conclusion This paper has developed and unified ideas a wide range of ideas: (a) subjunctive antecedents contain a modal operator (Isard 1974; Lyons 1977; Iatridou 2000; Schulz 2007: Ch.6) 39 Like von Fintel's theory, the apparatus here also allows one to explain the intuitive validity of many cases of transitivity as well as the asymmetries those inferences exhibit, but that too must be reserved for another occasion. W. Starr ⁄⁄  (b) subjunctive antecedents concern worlds that may be outside c (Stalnaker 1975; von Fintel 1999b) (c) indicatives presuppose their antecedent is compatible with c (Stalnaker 1975; Adams 1975b; Gillies 2009) (d) attending to the felicity conditions of conditionals impacts the debate about their logic Warmbrōd (1981b); Veltman (1986); Gillies (2009) (e) understanding the interaction of the modal operator in subjunctive antecedents is the key to understanding disjunctive antecedents (Here); alternative semantics may help some (Alonso-Ovalle 2009) (d) sequences of conditionals involve modal anaphora (Stone 1999; Brasoveanu 2010) Previous work has either offered no formal semantics to go with (a), has not unified that semantics with (b) or shown how it could fit into a theory that accepts (c) and (d). As was argued above, alternative semantics is not enough for (e). It must be combined at least with (a) to yield a compelling account of disjunctive antecedents. No existing approach has attempted to unify Sobel sequences with (d). While I have significantly developed many of these ideas here, the main achievement is their smooth integration into one simple and general picture about the semantics of conditionals. The semantics for \u0001 encoded the idea that subjunctive, unlike indicative, conditionals can involve a revision of an agent's information. However, it is quite important to qualify by noting that this kind of revision does not seem to be the same kind of revision we engage in when we learn our beliefs are false. Suppose you've just come into your office, flipped the switch up and the light is now on. You'd obviously accept (50). (50) If this switch were down, the light would be off Yet, if you turned around and saw that the light switch was actually down, you wouldn't come to accept the claim that the light is off. You'd more likely believe the light switch was inoperative and a motion detector had been installed; or maybe that your office is haunted. What these kind of examples illustrate is that subjunctive conditionals seem to provide a very local manipulation of a particular fact while general belief revision is a more global process. A semantics for \u0001 based on manipulating structural equations (Pearl 2000; Thomason 2007) is a promising way to respect this distinction while W. Starr ⁄⁄  preserving the analysis sketched above. Section §4 vindicated a variably-strict analysis in the face of some of the most important empirical challenges it has encountered. In terms of adjudicating between strict and variably-strict analyses this is an interesting result but as said in the introduction, my motivations are more general. I believe that f should not be analyzed in terms of similarity, but rather in terms of dependence, using the framework of structural equations. I think that only this approach can draw the deep connections between counterfactuals, belief revision and the structure of the natural world that have spurred their investigation in the philosophy of science and artificial intelligence. Like the similarity analysis, this will result in a variably-strict theory. By addressing some of the empirical problems for that approach, I hope to have brought us one step closer to addressing the questions about subjunctive conditionals that have made them a persistent interest of philosophers and cognitive scientists. This paper has illustrated a fruitful application of a dynamic approach to semantics where the meaning of a morpheme is not to be identified with its content (or even its character). Its meaning is the characteristic effect it has on the mental states of language users. Sentences can be associated with contents, since these states have contents. But the fundamental notions of semantics – word meaning, compositionality, entailment and veracity (truth or support) – are richer than a content-based theory can capture. It is always appropriate to regard new approaches critically and cautiously. But, I hope this work will encourage other philosophers to explore the resources provided by dynamic approaches and seriously consider it as not just a different technical apparatus, but a different and interesting perspective in the theory of meaning.

Starr ⁄⁄  A.1 Syntax and Semantics Remark 1 This does not permit indicative conditionals to nest in subjunctive conditionals or vice-versa, though that could be easily achieved.

Definition 19 (Support, Truth in w) (1) Support Cf \u000f φ⇔ ⋃ (Cf [φ]) = ⋃ Cf (2) Truth in w,f w, f \u000f φ⇔ {{w}}f [φ] = {{w}}f Definition 20 (Propositional Content) JφKf = {w | w, f \u000f φ} Definition 21 (Inquisitive Content) bφcf = C ′ ⇐⇒ {W}f [φ] = 〈C ′, f〉 Remark 4 Since \u0001 is the only operator sensitive to f , I will often omit f when writing bφc and JφK for φ that do not contain it. Definition 22 (Entailment) φ1, . . . , φn \u000f ψ ⇔ ∀Cf : Cf [φ1] * * * [φn] \u000f ψ • If Cf [φ1] * * * [φn][ψ] is defined. Definition 23 (Conditional Semantics) Cf [(if φ)ψ] =  {a ∈ C | Cf [φ] \u000f ψ}f if ⋃ (Cf [φ]) 6= ∅ Undefined otherwise Definition 24 (Alternative Counterfactual Expansion \u0001) Let f be a selection function and c = ⋃ C: Cf [\u0001α] = {{w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, a)} | a ∈ bαc}f W. Starr ⁄⁄  A.1 Syntax and Semantics Remark 5 To illustrate the definition, consider Cf [\u0001A]: Cf [\u0001A] = {{w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, a)} | a ∈ bAc}f = {{w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, JAK)}}f The second line follows since bAc = {JAK}. By the meaning of ∨, Cf [\u0001A ∨\u0001B] = Cf [\u0001A] ∪ Cf [\u0001B]. From the previous example it should be clear that this results in (A.1), the set of alternatives which were previously unioned in (??). (A.1) {{w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, JAK)}, {w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, JBK)}}f As desired, Cf [\u0001(A ∨ B)] will yield the same result. Cf [\u0001(A ∨ B)] = {{w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, a)} | a ∈ bA ∨ Bc}f = {{w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, JAK)}, {w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, JBK)}}f In this case, the second line follows since bA ∨ Bc = {JAK, JBK}. Thus, evaluating a disjunctive antecedent comes to the same thing whether the disjunction takes wide or narrow scope. It comes to evaluating whether or not the expanded set of alternatives supports the consequent. This raises a pertinent question: I've said what it takes for a set of worlds to support a sentence, but what does it take for a set of alternatives to support a sentence? Requiring that C[φ] = C produces an interesting but more fine-grained notion of support, requiring not only that φ provided no new information, but also introduced no new alternatives. To capture the old notion of support, I want to say that the underlying set of worlds is the same in C as in C[φ]. This is accomplished in Definition 22. W. Starr ⁄⁄  A.2 Results A.2 Results Fact 3 (Simple Subjunctive Conditional Propositions) For ψ ∈ WffA and free of 3 and , where bαc = {a0, . . . , an}: (1) J(if \u0001α)ψKf is well-defined iff ∀w ∈ W , ∃a ∈ bαc : f(w, a) 6= ∅ By Def's 20, 19.2, 23 and 24, J(if \u0001α)ψKf = {w | {f(w, a0), . . . , f(w, an)}f \u000f ψ} when defined. By Def 23, this is defined if and only if for all w ∈ W,⋃{f(w, a0), . . . , f(w, an)} 6= ∅. This holds at an arbitrary w iff ∃a ∈ bαc : f(w, a) 6= ∅. (2) When defined, J(if \u0001α)ψKf = {w | ⋃{f(w, a0), . . . , f(w, an)} ⊆ JψKf} As previously noted, J(if \u0001α)ψKf = {w | {f(w, a0), . . . , f(w, an)}f \u000f ψ}. ψ is neither conditional nor modal, so ∀Cf : Cf \u000f ψ iff ⋃ C ⊆ JψKf . Fact 4 (Import-Export) (if φ1) ((if φ2)ψ) \u000f \u000f (if φ1 ∧ φ2)ψ Proof When both forms are defined, they amount to the same update: Cf [(if φ1) ((if φ2)ψ)] = {a ∈ Cf | Cf [φ1] \u000f (if φ2)ψ}f = {a ∈ Cf | ⋃ (Cf [φ1][(if φ2)ψ]) = ⋃ (Cf [φ1])}f = {a ∈ Cf | ⋃ {a′ ∈ Cf [φ1] | Cf [φ1][φ2] \u000f ψ} = ⋃ (Cf [φ1])}f = {a ∈ Cf | Cf [φ1][φ2] \u000f ψ}f = {a ∈ Cf | Cf [φ1 ∧ φ2] \u000f ψ}f = Cf [(if φ1 ∧ φ2)ψ] Cases of undefinedness do not count towards validity and may be disregarded. Fact 5 (Modus Ponens) (if φ)ψ, φ \u000f ψ Proof Either Cf [(if φ)ψ] = Cf or Cf [(if φ)ψ] = ∅f . In the former case, Cf [φ] \u000f ψ and the condition needed for the entailment, ⋃ (Cf [(if φ)ψ][φ][ψ]) =⋃ (Cf [(if φ)ψ][φ]), is equivalent to ⋃ (Cf [φ][ψ]) = ⋃ (Cf [φ]). But since Cf [φ] \u000f ψ, this obtains. In the latter case Cf [(if φ)ψ][φ][ψ] = ∅f = Cf [(if φ)ψ][φ], so the entailment must also hold. Definition 25 (Persistence) φ is persistent iff C ′f \u000f φ if Cf \u000f φ and ⋃ C ′ ⊆⋃ C. (I.e. φ's support persists after more information comes in.) Fact 6 In general, 3φ is not persistent. Take a c containing many worlds but only one φ-world w. Then {c}f \u000f 3φ, but c− {w} ⊆ c and {c− {w}}f 2 3φ. W. Starr ⁄⁄  REFERENCES Fact 7 (Disj. Ants. 1) For persistent ψ, (if φ1 ∨ φ2)ψ \u000f (if φ1)ψ ∧ (if φ2)ψ Proof The premise tests that Cf [φ1] ∪ Cf [φ2] \u000f ψ. The conclusion presupposes that ⋃ (Cf [φ1]) 6= ∅ and ⋃ (Cf [φ2]) 6= ∅, and tests that Cf [φ1] \u000f ψ and Cf [φ2] \u000f ψ. Since ⋃ (Cf [φ1]) ⊆ ( ⋃ (Cf [φ1]) ∪ ⋃ (Cf [φ2])) and ⋃ (Cf [φ2]) ⊆ ( ⋃ (Cf [φ1]) ∪ ⋃ (c[φ2])), this test must be successful when ψ is persistent but may not be successful when ψ isn't persistent. Remark 6 (if p ∨ ¬p)3p 2 ((if p)3p) ∧ ((if ¬p)3p). If there are both p and ¬p worlds in c all presuppositions will be met and the premise will successfully test c. The second conjunct of the conclusion won't. Remark 7 While Fact 8 is limited to atomic α and β, it could be proven inductively for any α, β ∈ WffA, but I omit that lengthy proof here. Fact 8 (Disj. Ants. 2) For persistent ψ and atomic α, β, (if \u0001(α ∨ β))ψ \u000f (if \u0001α)ψ ∧ (if \u0001β)ψ Proof The premise tests that Cf [\u0001(α∨β)] \u000f ψ. By Definition 24, Cf [\u0001(α∨ β)] = {{w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, a)} | a ∈ bα ∨ βc}f . By Definitions 18.4, 18.1 and 21, bα ∨ βc = {JαK, JβK}, so the first line below follows. Cf [\u0001(α ∨ β)] = {{w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, JαK)}, {w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, JβK)}}f = {{w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, JαK)}}f ∪ {{w′ | ∃w ∈ c : w′ ∈ f(w, JβK)}}f = Cf [\u0001α] ∪ Cf [\u0001β] = Cf [\u0001α ∨\u0001β] The second line follows by set theory, and the last two by Definitions 24 and 18.4, respectively. From this equality and Fact 7, the entailment follows. References Adams, E. W. (1975a). 'Counterfactual Conditionals and Prior Probabilities'. In Hooker, C.

A Note on Eternity Ciro De Florio1 • Aldo Frigerio1 \u0002 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2016 Abstract The timeless solution to the problem of divine foreknowledge and human freedom has many advantages. Still, the relationship between a timeless God and temporal beings is problematic in a number of ways. In this paper, we focus on the specific problems the timeless view has to deal with when certain assumptions on the metaphysics of time are taken on board. It is shown that on static conception of time God's omniscience is easily accounted for, but human freedom is threatened, while a dynamic conception has no problems with human freedom, but, on this view, some truths seem not to be knowable by a timeless God. We propose Fragmentalism as a metaphysics of time in which the divine timeless knowledge of temporal events and human freedom can be reconciled. Keywords Divine omniscience \u0002 Eternalism \u0002 Fragmentalism \u0002 Temporal logic 1 Introduction Eternity is definitely a very difficult topic. With reference to (Sellars 1962, p. 527), William Craig writes: An eminent philosopher has remarked that ''the problem of time'' is virtually unrivaled in ''the extent to which it inexorably brings into play all the major concerns of philosophy''. Combine the problem of time with ''the problem of God,'' as the study of divine eternity requires, and you have a subject matter which would exhaust a lifetime of study. (Craig 2001, p. iii) Even confining ourselves only to recent contributes within the very conspicuous literature on this matter, we can identify at least three large families of problems. First of all, there is the problem of distinguishing the ways in which God and other timeless entities, such as abstract objects, eternally exist. In which sense is God out of time? Is He out of time in the same manner in which the number 4 is considered out of time? Note that the questions discussed in philosophy of mathematics since Benacerraf (see Benacerraf 1973) share interesting analogies with the topic of the interaction of a timeless God with temporal and spatial entities. One of the classical problems Benacerraf dealt with is how it is possible to characterize mathematical knowledge-i.e. knowledge of abstract properties and relations-in a naturalistic framework. Mathematical objects are abstract, timeless, non-spatial entities and, therefore, they are causally ineffective. Then, it is not clear how human beings, that are part of the temporal and spatial net, can acquire knowledge on the domain in question. Similarly, on the timeless account of God's existence, it is not clear how He can causally interact with spatial and temporal entities. In fact, the problem of the cross-relations between God and temporal entities is even more pressing: while it is possible to paraphrase mathematical language in order to show that its ontological commitment is actually less demanding for a naturalist account of knowledge, the same argumentative move is not available to an advocate of the timeless view of God. Another question, which has been discussed for a long time, concerns the nature of eternity itself. In particular, & Ciro De Florio ciro.deflorio@unicatt.it Aldo Frigerio aldo.frigerio@unicatt.it 1 Department of Philosophy, Catholic University of Milan, L.go Gemelli, 1, 20123 Milan, Italy 123 Topoi DOI 10.1007/s11245-016-9376-1 Author's personal copy one can inquire how a timeless entity can have a life, that is, how it can be in states that have a duration. A possible strategy is to claim that God's life has a simple extension, devoid of parts. Another way to answer is by calling into question the assumption that a personal being cannot have a punctual life, without any duration. A third family of problems specifically regards the relationship between a timeless God and the entities that exist in time. This paper will look into some of these problems. In particular, God's timeless conception will be compared with some metaphysical accounts of time. The paper is divided into five sections: in the next section, the timeless solution to the problem of divine omniscience and human freedom is reviewed. In Sect. 3 the relationship between God's timeless conception and a static metaphysics of time is analyzed. In Sect. 4 we provide some attempts to reconcile a genuinely dynamic conception of time with an atemporal view of God. Finally, Sect. 5 contains our proposal. 2 Timeless Solution to the Dilemma of God's Foreknowledge and Human Freedom The problem of divine foreknowledge and human freedom can be summed up as follows: God is omniscient and, therefore, He knows today what John will do on 3rd March 2026. In particular, assume that God knows that on 3rd March 2026 John decides to mow his lawn. Is John free to decide to mow his lawn or not? If John decided not to mow his lawn, then God's present belief would be false and, thus, He would not be omniscient. But, if John cannot do but to mow his lawn, he cannot be considered free. God's omniscience seems to be a limit to human beings' freedom. A possible solution to this problem is to state that God's knowledge is not in time. It is inappropriate to say that God knows something today because God is a timeless entity. He atemporally ''sees'' John's free act exactly as John's birth, his death, and every event that makes the world history. On this view, John can choose to mow his lawn or not because his choice has no influence on God's past beliefs, which do not properly exist. Some critics of this solution (cf., for instance, Zagzebski 1991) have objected that a fatalist argument can be mounted also in this case. The idea, in a nutshell, is that if God timelessly knows that John decides to mow his lawn- let us call p the proposition describing this state of affairs- the truth of p is fixed ab aeterno. It is, therefore, not in John's power to choose not to mow his lawn, making :p true. A possible response to this objection (cf. for example Rogers 2007) is to underline that God knows that John mows his lawn because John freely chooses to mow his lawn. Therefore, necessity of p does not undermine the agent's freedom. It is the agent herself who, by choosing p, makes p necessary. Now, since God is eternal, He is copresent with every time and knows every time as if it were present; therefore, God knows every action performed by the agent at every time. Nevertheless, this knowledge does not clash with the agent's freedom because it depends on the agent's choice. If we see an agent a performing an action p, then we know that a performs p and that p has a consequent necessity. Yet, this is not in contrast with a's freedom. The same is true for God: He eternally sees every point in time and thus He sees a performing p at t. So p has a consequent necessity at t, but neither God's knowledge nor the consequent necessity of p are in contrast with John's freedom. The timeless solution appears to be an interesting proposal to solve the dilemma of divine omniscience and human freedom. In fact, one of the main reasons to adopt a timeless conception of God is because it reconciles omniscience with freedom. However, we will see that this solution has to face the problem of the metaphysical relationship between an eternal entity and temporal entities and, in particular, the relationship between God's timeless knowledge and the temporal entities that are known. Under assumptions, these relationships seem to undermine human freedom. 3 God's Knowledge and the Static View of Time The metaphysics of time one is assuming is crucial when inquiring the relationship between an eternal entity-like God-and the temporal states of affairs.1 We will distinguish below, rather roughly, two very general options regarding the metaphysics of time: the static (or eternalist) conception and the dynamic conception.2 The eternalist conception seems to be particularly consonant with the idea of an omniscient and timeless God. However, the advocates of this conception have to deal 1 Obviously, the assumed metaphysics of time is not relevant when the intrinsic nature of a timeless God has to be characterized. By definition, an entity that is outside time is compatible with presentism, eternalism and the conceptions that are intermediate between these two (growing block theory, moving spotlight, etc.). It is, of course, necessary to formulate the different metaphysics of time in such a way that they do not exclude that something outside time can exist. For instance, if the main thesis of presentism is: only present entities exist (cf., for example, Crisp 2003), this axiom should be reformulated as: all that exists in time exists in the present. 2 We prefer not to use the A-theory–B-theory terminology here because it could be difficult to ascribe some positions to these classes. Consider, for instance, the moving spotlight theory. According to this view, all temporal things exist eternally. However, the present has a privileged ontological status and determines the objective time flow. This position has some features of both the A-theory (the present is ontologically privileged and time flows objectively) and the B-theory (future and past facts exist eternally). C. De Florio, A. Frigerio 123 Author's personal copy with one main issue: the fatalist threat. Let us see this point in detail. In our discussion we will presuppose a rather shared principle, the Truthmaker Principle: (TM) Every truth requires a truthmaker, an existing state of affairs (or 'fact') that necessitates and thereby grounds its truth.3 God is conceived as out of time and, thus, His knowledge cannot change and evolve in any way. Now, since God is omniscient, He knows every truth. For (TM), if God knows p, then there exists a truthmaker that makes p true. The matter becomes particularly intriguing when we assume that God (atemporally) knows the future course of history.4 Let us assume that God eternally knows that John mows his lawn on 3rd March 2026. Since knowledge is factive, it is true that John mows his lawn on 3rd March 2026. This proposition is true, therefore a truthmaker that makes the proposition true must exist. Under some assumptions, the truthmaker cannot be a present state of affairs, because at the present nothing determines John's future free choice. John's future free choice must, in a certain sense, already exist. The thesis that all facts-past, present, future ones- exist is usually called ''block universe theory''. The whole history of the world is already given and the only temporal relations are the relations ''earlier than'', ''simultaneous with'', etc. that characterize the B-series. God's omniscience and eternity seem to imply a static view of time. However, it is not clear whether such a view allows for a libertarian conception of freedom.5 If every choice is already given, it is not indeterminate today whether John will perform p or not in the future. If nothing is indeterminate, no room seems to be left for libertarian freedom. A first solution is to accept a compatibilist view of freedom. On this view, the problem of divine prescience and human freedom rapidly dissolves. However, here we would like to investigate the solutions that hold a stronger conception of freedom, that is the libertarian conception. 4 God's Knowledge and the Dynamic View of Time Only few advocates of the eternalist conception of God are ready to pay the price of a block universe because such a view of time seems to undermine a strong conception of freedom. Consider the two following thesis: 1. God exists in a timeless manner and He has a particular relationship with the temporal entities. 2. Time flows and the becoming of temporal entities is a real dimension of being. In this section we will discuss two significant proposals that hold these two points: Stump and Kretzmann's and Leftow's positions. We will see, however, that, their merits notwithstanding, they suffer some problems. 4.1 Simultaneity and Eternity Stump and Kretzmann believe that time and eternity are separate ontological dimensions. The eternal events cannot be temporal and, conversely, the temporal events cannot be eternal. Since there are two categories of events (temporal and eternal), there must be two simultaneity relations, one for the temporal events and the other for the eternal events: (T) T-simultaneity = existence or occurrence at one and the same time (E) E-simultaneity = existence or occurrence at one and the same eternal present (Stump and Kretzmann 1981, p. 435) In order to characterize the relationship between the eternal God and the temporal world, Stump e Kretzmann postulate a third type of simultaneity, called ET-simultaneity: (ET) For every x and for every y, x and y are ETsimultaneous iff (1) either x is eternal and y is temporal, or vice versa; and (2) for some observer, A, in the unique eternal reference frame, x and y are both present-i.e. either x is eternally present and y is observed as temporally present, or vice versa; and 3 For this formulation, (Rhoda 2009, p. 41). On this topic, we refer, among others, to Armstrong (2004), Beebee and Dodd (2005), Lowe and Rami (2009). 4 Admittedly, on the ground of the definition of knowledge and from that of truthmaking, one could consistently claim that, since today it is neither true nor false that John will make p tomorrow, there is no actual truthmaking that makes the proposition true (or its contradictory true). Accordingly, one should affirm that even God does not know the outcome of John's decision today, because this is indeterminate at the present. God will learn tomorrow what John will decide tomorrow because He will see his decision. However, this conception requires a temporal God, who changes His beliefs on the basis of what happens in time. 5 On this point, W.L. Craig notices an interpretative problem in Thomas Aquinas' position. Although it is reasonable to believe that Thomas considered becoming an objective feature of reality and embraced a dynamic view of time, his doctrine on future contingents is intelligible only if a tenseless theory of time is assumed: ''[...] The entire temporal series would seem to exist timelessly, on the analogy of a spatial extension, and as such is known by God'' (Craig 1988, p. 117). A Note on Eternity 123 Author's personal copy (3) for some observer, B, in one of the infinitely many temporal reference frames, x and y are both present-i.e. either x is observed as eternally present and y is temporally present, or vice versa. (Stump and Kretzmann 1981, p. 439) The relation of ET-simultaneity is symmetric (if x is ETsimultaneous with y, then y is ET-simultaneous with x), but also irreflexive and intransitive. If it were transitive, absurd conclusions would follow: since time t is ET-simultaneous with God and God is ET-simultaneous with another time t', it would follow that t and t' are ET-simultaneous. A possible problem concerns the temporal/eternal existence of events. Stump and Kretzmann mention the following example. Suppose that in His eternal present God is simultaneous-ET-simultaneous-with Richard Nixon when he was alive on 9th August 1974. However, God is also simultaneous with Richard Nixon at the moment of his death on 22th April 1994.6 From the point of view of God's eternal present, Nixon is both alive and dead, which is absurd. Stump and Kretzmann respond that: One and the same eternal present is ET-simultaneous with Nixon's being alive and is also ET-simultaneous with Nixon's dying; so Nixon's life is ET-simultaneous with and hence present to an eternal entity, and Nixon's death is ET-simultaneous with and hence present to an eternal entity, although Nixon's life and Nixon's death are themselves neither eternal nor simultaneous (Stump and Kretzmann 1981, p. 443) Stump and Kretzmann's view has received numerous criticisms. It has been claimed that their position is obscure (Fitzgerald 1985; Helm 2011) or that it introduces a concept (that of ET-simultaneity) that is entirely ad hoc and that does not offer any explanation of the metaphysical relationship between eternity and time (Yates 1990; Helm 2011). However, we do not believe these criticisms to be appropriate: the ET-simultaneity relation is neither obscure nor unjustified. The basic idea is that there are two dimensions-the temporal and eternal dimensions-and three different kinds of relationships that characterize the relations among temporal things, those among eternal things and those between temporal and eternal things. In fact, no account claiming that God is outside time can dispense with these three kinds of relationships.7 What seems a more serious difficulty for Stump and Kretzmann's position is that the relation of ET-simultaneous is completely unanalyzed. In fact, such relation is substantiated in a different way according to the accepted metaphysics of time. For example, consider the static block-universe. Then, ET-simultaneous is a relation between static and non-dynamical things and can be conceived as stable and a-temporal. Instead, let us assume a non-dynamic metaphysics of time according to which the present time is privileged compared to the other times. Since there is a variable privileged time (the present), how can God have the same ET-simultaneous relation with every time? The present is distinct from the other times and this fact represents an important feature of temporal reality. How can God have the same identical relationship with the present time and with the other times? Only two alternatives seem to be open: either we affirm that God does not know an ontological trait of the world-for instance, the fact that it is 4 o'clock now-or we affirm that the dynamicity of time is an illusion. However, both these alternatives are unpalatable. So, the question is whether it is possible to reconcile the temporal dynamic with the fact that God has the same relationship with every time. Since Stump and Kretzmann do not analyze the ET-simultaneous relation in any way, these problems remain unsolved. 4.2 Leftow's Position Brian Leftow puts forward an alternative solution. His basic intuition is that the events are, in a way, both temporal and eternal. Consequently, God, who lives in the eternity, sees events under the eternal respect while they are temporally present to us. Leftow characterizes the eternal dimension by means of an analogy according to which space is to time as time is to eternity. The analogy is rather articulated (Leftow 2009, pp. 212–213) but we will just focus on a few points: as all the spatial points co-exist in a unique instant of time, so all the temporal points co-exist (and, in a sense, are contained) in the eternity. Particularly, just as entities with spatial features remain so when they exist in time, so entities with temporal features remain so when they exist in eternity. Reality is, according to Leftow, structured in an eternal dimension which includes God and the temporal things that exist at once. Therefore, God and the world are 6 Richard Nixon died in 1994, after the publication of Stump and Kretzmann's paper. We have changed the example in light of this. 7 Stump and Kretzmann's theory is a more formal version of a classical way of representing the relationships between temporality and eternity, which goes back at least to Boethius: that of a circle with a point in the center. The circle represents the temporal series while the central point is God's eternal perspective, which has the same Footnote 7 continued relation with every point of the circle. In this representation there are two kinds of points: those on the circle and that in the center. They represent the two dimensions: temporality and eternity. The relations TS and ES are represented by the relations between the things that are on circle and those that are in the center respectively. The existence of the radii of the circle justifies the third kind of relationship-the ETS relation. C. De Florio, A. Frigerio 123 Author's personal copy simultaneous in the eternity but nevertheless the world does not lose its genuine temporal properties. In order to explain how an event can be both temporally located and eternally present, Leftow assumes a particular interpretation of Special Relativity according to which the concept of simultaneity is relative to a framework. It is both scientific and philosophical folklore that one of the consequences of the Special Relativity Theory is the relativization of the concept of simultaneity between events to different inertial systems. Leftow's philosophical intuition proposes to extend the relativity of simultaneity to the concept of actuality of the events: If simultaneity and presentness are relative to reference frames, then if present events are actual in some way in which future events are not, this sort of actuality is itself relative to reference frames. Thus, there is a (strictly limited) sense in which the relativity of simultaneity entails a relativity of actuality. (Leftow 2009, p. 232) We shall not discuss here the plausibility of this particular interpretation of the Theory of Special Relativity even if- obviously-a good deal of philosophical work should be done in order to show the very possibility of extending to actuality what it holds for the simultaneity. Robinson sums up: [A]lthough all events of all times are present at once in eternity, it does not follow that all events of all times are present at once in time or in any temporal reference frame. Although in eternity time is tenseless, it does not follow that in time time is tenseless. (Robinson 1995, p. 133) Unlike Stump and Kretzmann's account, which state just one ontological dimension for the mundane events-that is, the temporal one-Leftow provides a sort of ontological reduplication: things exist in time and in eternity. A first problem of such a view concerns human freedom. If it is eternally true that Obama drinks a beer on 24th May 2032, is Obama really free of doing otherwise on that day? We shall not seriously take into account this problem, but we believe that Rogers gave an adequate answer to it, by carefully distinguish between eternity and necessity (Rogers 2007). The fact that it is eternally true that Obama drinks a beer on 24th May 2032 does not mean that this fact is necessary. Obama could act differently, and in that case, it would be not eternally true that Obama has his beer at that time, but instead the negation of that proposition would be true. Moreover, it is necessary to distinguish between ''eternal'' and ''since always''. From the notion of eternity does not follow that the events are fixed ''from the beginning'', with the consequence that it would be already true from the beginning of time that Obama drinks a beer on 24th May 2032. In the a-temporal dimension, that event is so and so just because Obama chooses in that way in the temporal dimension.8 Another problem of Leftow's proposal seems to be more complicated. Leftow advocates a dynamic conception of time. This means that there is a privileged instant (the present), that this privileged instant changes and that this fact is a genuine ontological feature of reality. This is true for those who accept presentism and for those who accept a version of the moving spotlight theory: in both cases the temporal reality is characterized by a privileged instant with respect to the others. However, in God's eternal framework all the times are on a par and there is no privileged instant. By definition, there is no dynamicity. There seems to be a feature of reality that is not grasped by God. Notice that it is not possible to say that the dynamic status of temporal reality is just an illusion and that only the eternal dimension obtains. This would be in contrast with Leftow's proposal: it would lead us to a static conception of temporality. The privileged instant, on the contrary, is not an illusion and, therefore, the dynamicity is something that essentially characterizes the temporal reality. Often this problem is emphatically set by stating that a timeless God cannot know what time it is. If one accepts the idea that the dynamicity of time is an illusion, in other terms, if one accepts a block universe, this is not a problem. But if one is ready to say that the universe is dynamic, then the fact that it is 4 o' clock and not 5 o' clock, or that now Obama is drinking his beer, is an actual feature of the reality which a timeless God cannot access since for Him all times are on a par. And if there is something real which God does not know that could represent a problem for His omniscience. At first glance, in Leftow's framework, there is no way to escape this problem. Let us briefly sum up what has been stated so far. Two problems emerge within the tenseless conception of divine knowledge. Firstly, if it is eternally true that an agent does p at time t, it seems that the agent cannot do otherwise and, then, this position would imply the theological fatalism. Secondly, assuming a dynamic conception of time, there is an instant, the present, which is privileged. But from the eternal point of view of God, no time is privileged, therefore it seems that God does not grasp an aspect of reality. Stump and Kretzmann's solution from one hand and Leftow's, from the other, do not provide an adequate solution to the second problem. We believe, however, that by assuming a fragmentalist conception of time a solution can be found. The next section will discuss this topic. 8 This solution has a price: it admits a grounding relation between the free choices of a temporal entity (Obama) and an eternal state of affairs (divine knowledge). This relation has to be a-temporal even if it seems to be alike to a causal relation which can hardly be considered out of time. A Note on Eternity 123 Author's personal copy 5 Divine Knowledge and Fragmentalism In the previous paragraphs we have seen that it is not easy to characterize a timeless account of divine knowledge; here, we will provide a tentative answer by referring-at least partially-to Kit Fine's account in philosophy of time known as Fragmentalism (Fine 2005; see also Lipman 2015).9 We will proceed as follows: we will state four general theses concerning our version of Fragmentalism and then we will offer a timeless account of divine knowledge. (T1) Temporal reality is fragmented It is important not to equivocate, here: (T1) does not mean that there is something, i.e. the temporal reality, whose parts are fragments of it. On the contrary, this is exactly the thesis Fragmentalism denies: reality is originally fragmented. What exists in a proper sense, in any instant, is a fragment. And-as we will see below-it is not possible to coherently refer to something as ''all fragments''. (T2) Every fragment is constituted by tensed facts: past, present and future facts So, time is ''real'' since there exist genuine A-properties. In every fragment, there exists a set of present facts, the ''now'' of the fragment. In the next fragment, part of the future facts of the previous fragment are present facts, present facts are past and so on. (T3) Fragments are incompatible This would be not surprising. Let us assume that now Obama is standing. In another fragment, Obama is sitting; so, the two fragments are not compatible. (Lipman 2015) developed a logical framework in which one can handle two types of consistency which he calls, respectively, coherence and coherence*. The idea, in a nutshell, is the following: he provides a semantic to a dyadic connective '•' whose intended meaning is ''is compatible with''. This allows us to say that whilst it is not logically contradictory that Obama is sitting and Obama is standing, since there can be two fragments in which these states of affairs obtain, the two facts are incompatible since there is no fragment in which both states of affairs obtain.10 (T4) Fragments are not internally complete This is the most relevant difference with respect to Fine's system. To guarantee freedom in the libertarian sense, we assume that the facts of a fragment are not a maximal set; there are undetermined regions, i.e. those dependent on the agent's free decisions. Our metaphysical framework is then-very roughly- described by (T1–T4). How does God eternally know? The idea is that God simultaneously sees each fragment. Let K(g,p) be the eternal fact that God knows the proposition p. And this holds for all true propositions, given God's omniscience. p is true in virtue of a truthmaker, that is, a fact which makes it true. So, God eternally knows that Obama drinks a beer in 2032 because Obama freely chooses to have a beer. Today Obama has not chosen yet and the proposition relative to this fragment is neither true nor false: it is about a region of the future which is ontologically undetermined. But if Obama decides to have such beer, then this fact is actual-in a certain fragment-and the proposition is true relative to that fragment. There exists no ontologically dimension beyond the temporal one, as it happens in Leftow's proposal. Obama does not have a modality of eternal existence, in addition to the temporal existence. Obama just exists in time and the existence in time is fragmented. We said that a fundamental problem for the eternist accounts is to preserve the timelessness of divine knowledge together with free acts. These two facts seem to contradict each other: if God eternally knows a free act F, F has to be, in a way, determinate and then F cannot be really free. Fragmentalism answers to this dilemma by stating that F-as any mundane reality-is never determinate or indeterminate simpliciter but always with respect to a fragment. Therefore, F is not determinate in a given fragment but it is in another. And the reason of its determinateness is the agent's free action. That decision exists as a present fact and as a past fact. But it is not necessary, since its nature is decided by the agent. On the proposed view, even if God is conceived as eternal and even if the reality is dynamic, God has a full access to the temporal reality and there is no feature of reality He cannot know. For every fragment has a privileged instant, the ''now'', and God knows which instant is privileged in any fragment. Obviously, from an eternal point of view, there are many ''nows'', all incompatible; but this is not a problem for the fragmentalist since this is her basic intuition: temporal reality is fragmented. Contrary to the more traditional dynamic conceptions of reality, in this framework any fragment has its now; therefore, there is no aspect of reality that God cannot know. There are (at least) three possible objections to our account: 9 We are not interested in a faithful construal of Fine's position; rather, we will exploit some intuitions of fragmentalism which we think illuminating to solve the problem of divine timeless knowledge. 10 Lipman's system has weird consequences: for instance, from A•B does not follow A. C. De Florio, A. Frigerio 123 Author's personal copy 1. A first objection is that Fragmentalism is not a real dynamic conception of time. There is no real passage from one fragment to another but there is just a fragmented temporal reality which is intrinsically static. So, the success of Fragmentalism is illusory; it solves the problems the dynamic conceptions deal with just because it is not a dynamic conception but an eternalism in disguise. One can answer to that by noting that the Fragmentalism's conception of time is quite far from the block universe view of eternalism. The tensed properties of facts are different within the various fragments and through these properties it is possible to reconstruct a sort of passage of time. For instance, in fragment f1 a fact s can hold the tensed property of being future, in fragment f2 the property of being present and in fragment f3 that of being past. It is therefore possible to reconstruct the passage of time according to which s is future, then present, then past by means of the tensed properties of the fragments f1, f2 and f3. 2. There is no-since there cannot be-a coherent description of God's contents of knowledge. Let us elaborate. The indeterminist conception we assumed entails the following: let f1 and f2 be two fragments; let us describe the fact that Obama drinks a beer A, and the fact that Obama does not drink a beer :A. Let us employ P, N, F as tensed attributes meaning respectively past, present and future. Given the indeterminism we have that in f1, N(:F(A)) and N(:F(:A)), namely, today it is not a fact that in the future Obama will drink a beer and it is not a fact that in the future Obama will not drink a beer. Things obviously change in f2. Obama (freely) chooses to drink a beer and then we have N(A). But if it is currently true that N(A), then it must be a past fact in f2 that Obama would drink a beer, that is P(F(A)). Therefore God knows that :F(A), that :F(:A) and that A. The ground of His knowledge in the first two cases is the fact that Obama has not chosen yet, while in the third case, that Obama has chosen. Since God's knowledge is always actual (eternity as extended present) God sees things as present, which are, in turn, present, past, and future. On this account, God sees both the indeterminateness of A and its actuality. He sees them in two different fragments. However, according to Fragmentalism, the various fragments are incompatible; so, the fact that A is indeterminate in the fragment f1 and actual in the fragment f2 is not troublesome In a certain sense, even our knowledge is structured in this way: we know that yesterday it was indeterminate that Obama would drink a beer today, but we know that it is not indeterminate today that Obama is drinking now a beer and then that today is determinate that it was true yesterday that Obama would drink a beer today. 3. One could maintain that throughout the fragments there exists a true future: there is a set of facts which, at the end of the day, will be actual despite the indeterminateness within a single fragment. Sure, it is indeterminate whether today Obama will drink his beer but Obama is going to choose something and his choice is actual in a certain fragment. So, as in the Ockhamist accounts, there exists ''today'' the sequence of true future propositions: the Thin Red Line (TRL), quoting Belnap's expression (Belnap et al. 2001). Here, there is a an objective tension: on one hand, Fragmentalism is not committed to the existence of TRL since all that exists there exists in the fragments and, by definition, the TRL is a section of the fragments; but on the other hand, we should concede that God knows the TRL and then it exists-in a sense. Our aim is not to characterize the reality sub specie aeternitatis; rather, we would like to provide an account of timeless divine knowledge which is compatible with free agents and a genuine dynamism of time. Moreover, we think, that the existence-in a sense-of a real future and God's knowledge of this future is a minimal condition not to misinterpret the intuitive concept of omniscience which grounds the classical theism. According to this definition, a nonomniscient God could not be provident, with all the consequences. 6 Conclusions In this work, we have discussed the timeless account of divine knowledge. Traditionally, there are good reasons to believe that God does not exist in time and that, consequently, His modality of knowledge is timeless. That is, God does not foreknow the future but He sees any instant as if it were present. Among the reasons to advocate this view, it is particularly relevant the fact that it gives a coherent account of the divine omniscience and human freedom. However, some questions can be triggered by the eternist solution. First of all, it is reasonable to presuppose a God who does not exist in time only if the time is real. If we adopt a static metaphysics of time, like, for instance, the block-universe view, then it is not complicated to characterize the relationship between the eternal God and temporal reality. But it is, indeed, a cheap victory: since the passage of time is not real, the modality of existence of God and of the world are not so different. Much more demanding is trying to reconcile a dynamic metaphysics of time-where the flow of time is a genuine feature of reality-with a timeless conception of God. A Note on Eternity 123 Author's personal copy Ironically, the most puzzling problems are the free actions and the divine knowledge of the tensed aspects of the world. We have seen how two important and influential contributes (by Stump and Kretzmann, and Leftow) show, in our opinion, some intrinsic flaws. Our proposal is to advocate a different conception of time, that is a version of Kit Fine's Fragmentalism. Even if this theoretical option has relevant theoretical costs, we believe it to be more suitable as far as God's eternal knowledge is concerned. This account preserves two hardly compatible aspects: on the one hand reality is intrinsically temporal (and for that reason, Fine himself defined his theory as a form of nonstandard A-theory); on the other, God holds the same relationship with all the temporal facts, that is, He sees reality as (eternally) present. Fragmentalism does not lack internal problems; however, we are not interested in a defence of this particular metaphysics of time. What we would like to argue for is that, if accepted, the Fragmentalism provides the best metaphysical framework to account for a timeless view of divine knowledge.

A problem for predicativism solved by predicativism DELIA GRAFF FARA Consider the following sentences: (1) In every race, the colt won; (2) In every race, John won. John Hawthorne and David Manley (2012, 236) say that the difference between these two sentences raises a problem for Predicativism about names.1 According to the currently more standard version of Predicativism about names, a bare singular name in argument position, like 'John' in (2), is embedded in (what I call) a denuded definite description, a definite description 'Øthe John', where 'Øthe' is an unpronounced definite article. The problem is supposed to be that (1) permits a covarying reading that allows for different races to have been won by different colts, while (2) does not permit a covarying reading-it can be true only if there is a single John that won every race. But, the objection runs, if the name 'John' is really embedded in a denuded definite description 'Øthe John', then the two sentences are structurally parallel and should not differ with respect to covariation. Appealing to Jason Stanley's 'Nominal Restriction' (the 2005 version), I show that the difference between the two sentences above not only does not raise a problem for Predicativism but is actually predicted by it. Let me start out by making a different comparison: (2) In every race, John won; (3) In every race, the John won. For an utterance of (2) to be meaningful, there must be a particular John being talked about. The truth of such an utterance requires that particular Analysis Vol 75 | Number 3 | July 2015 | pp. 362–371 doi:10.1093/analys/anv042 \u0002 The Author 2015.

But an utterance of sentence (3) can be meaningful even if there is no particular John being talked about. Its truth requires that in every race, the person called John in that race won that race. It could be a different John in each race, say John Terry in one race, John Burgess in another race, John Cooper in a third and so on. The difference between (1) and (2) is paralleled by that between (3) and (2). The sentence with the bare singular name 'John' does not permit a covarying reading while (1) and (3), the sentences with the overt definite article, both do. Sentences like (3) are among those that motivate a predicativist view about names. Here are some other examples: (4) There are two Johns in my department; (5) Most Michaels have conservative parents; (6) Sarahs from Alaska are usually scary; (7) The Erin that I met yesterday is a primary-school teacher. According to predicativists, names are not referring expressions but more like count-noun predicates such as 'student', 'hunter' and 'woman': they have a predicate-type semantic value. The answer to the question what type of semantic value do predicates have? may vary from theory to theory. Alternatives include sets of entities, functions from entities to truth values, functions from either situations or possible worlds to one or the other of these and properties. In addition, it is part and parcel of Predicativism, as I use the term, that names, as predicates, are true of their bearers. Using double-bracket notation to represent the function from an expression to its semantic value and taking the semantic value of a predicate to be the set of entities it's true of, predicativists say: (8) For any name N, [N]1⁄4fx : x has N as a nameg. So what does a predicativist say when a name occurs as a bare singular in argument position, as in the sentence 'Michael is happy'? Predicates are not of the right semantic type to combine with one another to yield a truth value: sets (or their type-he, ti characteristic functions or functions from worlds to extensions, et cetera) do not semantically compose with each other. Predicates require subjects. Predicativists propose that when a name appears as a bare singular in argument position, it is actually embedded in a determiner phrase with an unpronounced, or 'phonologically null', determiner. Now we have a choice point: what determiner is that? 'That'-predicativists say that the hidden determiner is a demonstrative.2 'The'-predicativists say that the hidden 2 The first advocate of this view was Tyler Burge (1973). Subsequent defenders include Jennifer Hornsby (1976), Reinaldo Elugardo (2002) and Sarah Sawyer (2010). a problem for predicativism solved by predicativism | 363 at Princeton U niversity on July 31, 2015 http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/ D ow nloaded from determiner is the definite article.3 (There is a third option that is not entirely implausible: a 'some'-predicativist would say that the hidden determiner is just a simple existential.4) 'That'-predicativists might appear at first glance to be on better footing than 'The'-predicativists for two reasons. On the one hand, definite descriptions are often thought to require uniqueness. But most names, if predicates, would have multiple application since most names are shared by more than one thing. On the other hand, complex demonstratives seem better-suited to accommodate the singular reference effected by speakers when they use bare singular names in argument position. If the name 'John' in (2) were equivalent to the complex demonstrative 'that John', that would explain why an utterance of the sentence could be meaningful only if there were a particular John-that John-being referred to. But 'The'-predicativists, of which I am one, can respond to both points. Definite descriptions occur often (if not most often) as incomplete definite descriptions, ones that embed predicates with multiple application. Granted that, there is no problem if the denuded definite descriptions that embed names are incomplete. Furthermore, with respect to the second point, definite descriptions-especially incomplete ones-are easily used by speakers to refer to particular things. I say to you after a party at my house, (9) Three guests outstayed their welcome at the party. There were many parties that took place last night. But still, I am talking about a particular party. I am using the incomplete definite description in order to refer to that party. My usage bears two of the main hallmarks of reference: modal and temporal rigidity. Modal rigidity: when I say to you this morning, (10) People might have left the party by midnight. I am still talking about that very same party. Whether there is a possible world in which there is some other party that empties out by midnight is irrelevant to the truth of what I say in (10). I myself might well have had some different party last night, at which everyone got bored and left early, but still, that would not suffice to make (10) true. (We could of course haggle over the identity conditions for parties, but that's neither here nor there.) Temporal rigidity: when I said to you yesterday before the party, (11) I'm guessing that everyone will leave the party early. I was talking about the very same party that I later described as having had three guests who stayed too late. 3 The first advocate of this view was Clarence Sloat (1969). Subsequent defenders have included Francesco Orilia (2000), Paul Elbourne (2005), Ora Matushansky (2005, 2006b, 2008, 2014), Delia Fara (2011, 2015a, b) and Yu Izumi (2012). 4 Although it would be anachronistic to do so, one could say that Willard V. Quine (1960) was a 'some'-predicativist. 364 | delia graff fara at Princeton U niversity on July 31, 2015 http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/ D ow nloaded from The same goes for Strawson's (1950) sentence: (12) The table is covered with books. Someone who says this refers to a particular table with the incomplete description, and they do so rigidly-both modally and temporally. So 'The'-predicativists needn't worry about the incompleteness of the denuded definite descriptions that embed names, and they can subsume the fact that incomplete definite descriptions with names are used by speakers to refer to particular things under the more general phenomenon of incomplete definite descriptions being used by speakers to refer to particular things. So why do I prefer 'The'-Predicativism to 'That'-Predicativism? A number of authors have argued specifically against 'That'-Predicativism: Higginbotham (1988), Segal (2001) and King (2006). Although I favour 'The'-Predicativism, I do not accept those arguments, but this is not the place to explain why. The main reason that I prefer 'The'-Predicativism to 'That'-Predicativism is that it affords an explanation of why names sometimes can and sometimes cannot occur with the definite article.5 Consider these sentences. (13) a. Michael is teaching Metaphysics this year; b. The ever-popular Michael is teaching Metaphysics this year; (14) a. Ivan, who is on the roof, is howling; b. The Ivan who is on the roof is howling; In these pairs of examples we see that while the overt definite article is sometimes prohibited from showing up with names, sometimes it is required to do so. In the a. sentences, we get ungrammaticality if the null definite article is made overt (without being stressed). But in the b. sentences we get ungrammaticality if the overt definite article is made null. In order to uncover a general rule that governs when the definite article must or must not be overt when it occurs with a name, let's describe the differences between the a. and b. sentences in (13 and 14). In (13a), the name is unmodified, while in (13b), the name is preceded by a modifying adjective. In (14a), the relative clause that follows the name is a nonrestrictive one, while in (14b), the relative clause that follows the name is a restrictive one. There is a general exception to be made here, though, concerning stressed definite articles. (15) A: My neighbour is married to John Terry; B: Well, MY neighbour is married to THE John Terry. 5 Matushansky (2014) provides an extended and thorough argument to the effect that examples of modified names, like the b. sentences in (13 and 14) make for a conclusive case for Predicativism about names. a problem for predicativism solved by predicativism | 365 at Princeton U niversity on July 31, 2015 http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/ D ow nloaded from When a definite article is stressed it can show up overtly when it has a name as its sister.6 I'm supposing that there's an ordinary John Terry known to both speakers of the sentences in (15). Speaker A means that her neighbour is married to that ordinary John Terry. But then speaker B comes along and says that his neighbour is married to the John Terry, meaning not just the ordinary John Terry known to both of them, but John Terry the beleaguered football star. Here, if an unstressed but overt definite article is added to (15a) or if the overt and stressed definite article in (15b) is destressed, ungrammaticality results. So here is a disjunctive statement of the constraint that governs when the definite article is required to occur as null when it combines with a name. I will shortly replace it with a systematic one. Disjunctive generalization concerning 'Øthe': The definite article will appear as null before names, except when it is heavily stressed or when the names are preceded by modifiers or followed by restrictive modifiers.7 I readily admit that the facts are not so simple as they are presented here and that more discussion would be needed to fully make the case, but for the purposes of this short essay, a general indication of the thesis and the arguments for it should suffice.8 If we look at the syntactic structures for the sentences in (13–15), we can uncover a smooth generalization-far more systematic than the disjunctive one above-for when a name can occur embedded in a definite description with an overt definite article. 6 Perhaps the stress on the definite article is used to suggest a unique importance, relative to the other satisfiers of its complement, of the thing that's intended to be talked about. 7 This is almost a direct paraphrase from Sloat (1969: 28). It was Sloat who first noticed the systematicity of the sorts of contrasts displayed in (13–15). He did not, however, propose any more systematic analysis than the disjunctive one just given. I do follow Sloat, though, in appealing to such examples to motivate and confirm 'The'-Predicativism, but my analysis of the contrasts departs significantly from his as well as from the one other one that I know of, given by Matushansky (2006a, b). 8 See Fara (2015b) for extended discussion and defence of the syntactic claims about 'Øthe'. 366 | delia graff fara at Princeton U niversity on July 31, 2015 http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/ D ow nloaded from The systematic generalization that emerges can be stated as the following constraint. Where 'Øthe': When a name occurs in a definite description, the definite article must be unpronounced when the name is its structural sister, unless the definite article is stressed.9 We can think of the rule in this way: there has to be a contraction between the definite article and a name when they are syntactically next to each other, in the sense of being syntactic sisters. What justifies the exception for stressed definite articles? Easy. It's not possible to stress a word without pronouncing it. This is similar to there being a preference for contracting the auxiliary verb 'have' with 'not', when 'not' immediately follows, unless the 'not' is stressed, in which case it cannot be contracted. Compare 'I haven't seen your book' with 'I have NOT seen your book'. With the first sentence it sounds like you've asked me to help you find your book, while with the second sentence it 9 Obviously, this rule is specific to English. In a number of natural languages, definite articles before unmodified singular names can, at least sometimes, get pronounced. Examples are Portuguese, Modern Greek, French, German, Italian and Spanish. (See Matushansky (2006b, 2008) for extensive cross-linguistic and intralinguistic discussion of the different strictures in different languages on the occurrence of an overt definite article with unmodified singular names.) a problem for predicativism solved by predicativism | 367 at Princeton U niversity on July 31, 2015 http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/ D ow nloaded from sounds like you've accused me of moving or hiding your book. As with the definite article, it is not possible to put stress on 'not' while still contracting it-'I haveN'T see your book' is not a sentence of English. Let's now return to my contrasting sentences (2) and (3). (2) In every race, John won; (3) In every race, the John won. It looks at face value as if (3) would be ungrammatical if my account were correct since it looks at face value as if in (3), 'the' and the name 'John' are syntactic sisters. So either my generalization is incorrect or things are not as they seem at face value. I claim that it is the latter. One way to account for the covariation in (3) is to posit a bindable variable as part of a nominal restriction on the name. This is what Jason Stanley and Zoltán Szabó do as part of their argument that quantifier domain restriction is to be accounted for as nominal restriction (Stanley and Szabó 2000).10 This is one of their leading examples: (16) In every room in John's house, every bottle is in the corner. This sentence obviously would not be used to mean that in every room in John's house every bottle in existence is in the corner. Nor would it be used to mean even that in every room in John's house, every bottle in his house in the corner. Rather, it would be used to mean that in every room in John's house, every bottle in that room is in the corner. The bottles covary with the room. Stanley and Szabó account for this by positing a nominal restriction that's syntactically attached to the noun 'bottle' and that contains a variable bound by a higher quantifier expression. In other words, they account for the covariation as variable binding into a covert nominal restriction. (17) In every room x in John's house, every bottle [in x] is in the corner [of x]. Here I use square brackets to indicate unpronounced material. Now, if we accounted for the covariation in (3) (as well as in (1)) in the same way, then we can understand, given my generalization concerning where we have 'Øthe', why we get a covarying interpretation with (3) but not (2). Now, if a covert nominal restriction containing a variable that's bound from without is syntactically attached to 'John', then given the Where 'Øthe' constraint, the definite article is required to be overt. But without the nominal restriction (or any other kind of modification), the definite article, if unstressed, is required to be null. (10) In every race x, the colt [in x] won [x]. (20) In every race [x], Øthe John won [x]. 10 See also Stanley (2000, 2002, 2005). 368 | delia graff fara at Princeton U niversity on July 31, 2015 http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/ D ow nloaded from (30) In every race x, the John [in x] won [x]. So the syntactic difference between the subject of (20) and that of (30) can be represented as follows: In (200), the definite article has the name 'John' as its sister and so must appear as Øthe. But in (3 00), the definite article does not have the name as its sister but rather a name that's modified by a restrictive relative clause, albeit a covert one, and so must appear as overt 'the'. For further confirmation of my explanation, note how the following sentences differ from their counterparts in (1–3). Here the quantifier phrase 'every race' no longer has the subject expressions in its scope and so cannot bind any variables in those subjects. (18) The colt won in every race; (COVARYING READING IS POSSIBLE, BUT MARGINAL) (19) John won in every race; (COVARYING READING IS NOT POSSIBLE) (20) ?? The John won in every race. (ONLY THE COVARYING READING IS POSSIBLE, BUT IT IS MARGINAL) We find that (18) does not easily receive the covarying reading.11 Regarding (19), as before, there is no covarying reading since 'John' does not occur with an overt definite article, there. The key sentence now is the ungrammatical (20) (ungrammatical if not covarying, which is a marginal interpretation for the sentence). Its ungrammaticality is straightforwardly explained by my view. Since the name is no longer in the scope of a variable binder, it does not have a variable-containing nominal restriction and is therefore the syntactic sister of the definite article, which therefore, by my Where 'Øthe' rule, must not be pronounced.12 So, to wrap up, the putative problem for Predicativism as raised by Hawthorne and Manley was why (1) but not 11 This is an example of what's known as 'weak crossover': crossover because in order to get the covarying reading, the quantifier phrase 'every race' has to move out of its prepositional phrase and cross over the subject in order to get its variable in its scope; weak because the crossed-over reading is not impossible, but it is more or less marginal. 12 Note also that while a weak-crossover reading might be possible for (20), it is definitely not possible for (19). a problem for predicativism solved by predicativism | 369 at Princeton U niversity on July 31, 2015 http://analysis.oxfordjournals.org/ D ow nloaded from (2) could have a covarying interpretation. The proponents of nominal restriction say that in order for the definite descriptions 'the colt' and 'the John' to have a covarying interpretation, they must be modified by a nominal restriction containing a variable available to be bound by the higher quantifier expression, in this case 'every race x'. Appealing to nominal restriction, the predicativist explains Hawthorne and Manley's contrast by saying that we cannot get a covarying interpretation of (2) or (3) unless there is a nominal restriction on the name that contains a variable that's available to be bound by a higher quantifier. But, given the Where 'Øthe' constraint, there cannot be a nominal restriction modifying the name 'John' in (2) since if there were, the definite article could not appear as null. Meanwhile, turning to my contrast between (2) and (3), the reason that (3) gets a covarying interpretation is that the presence of an unstressed overt definite article requires that there be some modifier attached to the name 'John'-a covert modifier, given that there is no overt one. One immediate corollary is that Stanley and Szabo's nominal restrictions do indeed have a syntactic reality, as they claim, since otherwise its presence in (300) would not force an overt pronunciation of the definite article. Another corollary is that not only do these restrictions have a syntactic reality, they must also occupy their own syntactic node. That view had been explicitly rejected by Stanley and Szabo (2000), who claimed that the nominal restrictions ''cohabited'' a node with the noun that they restrict. But it was later advocated specifically in solo work by Stanley (2005). The upshot is that appeal to Stanley's (2005) version of nominal restriction, combined with 'The'-Predicativism, in particular, along with my supplementary Where 'Øthe' constraint, provides a clean explanation of the contrasts in our two pairs of sentences. In this way, the two theories confirm one another; they are mutually reinforcing. Each works better with the other.13 Princeton University 212 1879 Hall Princeton New Jersey 08544-1006, USA dfara@princeton.edu References Burge, T. 1973. Reference and proper names.

I conclude that, despite being initially counterintuitive, the view of visualization as a kind of occurrent belief is the most promising. 1. The freedom and usefulness of imagination Visualization is a key construct to a variety of research programs within cognitive science and psychology. But what is visualization, cognitively speaking? At a first pass, we can say that it is any cognition that involves visual mental imagery; to visualize is to visually imagine. Visualizations are visual instances of what philosophers sometimes call \"perceptual\" or \"sensory\" imagination. More substantive explanations normally proceed through comparisons to visual perception: the phenomenology of visual imagining is similar to that of visual perception, the two share many underlying neural mechanisms,1 and psychophysical experiments suggest important similarities between the two.2 1 Notably, the overlap in neural mechanisms is only partial. On the one hand, disruption of activity in visual area V5 impedes performance on imagery-related tasks (Kosslyn, et al., 1999). And neuroimaging results show activation in common areas during visual and visual imagery tasks (Ganis, Thompson, & Kosslyn, 2004; Mechelli, Price, Friston, & Ishai, 2004)-yet, these same studies also indicate that the overlap is not complete. Moreover, there are double-dissociations reported between visual perception and visual imagery 2 Then there are the obvious differences between visualization and visual perception. Visualization is under control of the will in a way perception is not; it is often triggered by memory searches and action-planning routines, and not by the state of the world before one's eyes. So, the two have very different kinds of causes. As for their effects, a visual perceptual experience of an apple typically causes a belief in the presence of an apple; a visual imagining of an apple does not. Visually perceiving a tornado fifty yards away normally causes an intense emotional response; visualizing one normally doesn't (though this isn't to say it results in no affective response). Supposing we were to type mental states by their typical causes and effects, visualizations would come out relatively unlike visual perceptions. The functional dissimilarities between visualization and visual perception-what we can think of as diachronic dissimilarities, revealed in the causes and effects of the states across time-are often obscured by the intense focus researches have had on the potential format similarities between the two.3 Here I want to focus on the diachronic dissimilarities between visualization and perception, without prejudice to whatever format similarities they might or might not have. For I think this focus reveals an easily overlooked puzzle about visualization-one which lies at the heart of understanding visualization's role in the broader cognitive economy. The puzzle derives from the simultaneous freedom and usefulness of visual imagination (I will use 'visual imagination' equivalently with 'visualization'). As remarked, what we imagine is more or less up to us; intuitively, it is \"free\" in a way that both perception and belief are not. On the other hand, we rely upon visualization to guide us abilities in neurological subjects (Bartolomeo, et al., 1998; Bartolomeo, Bachoud-Levi, & Denes, 1997; Behrmann, Moscovitch, & Winocur, 1994; Chatterjee & Southwood, 1995). 2 Performance on visual imagery tasks degrades when subjects are given a concurrent visual perception task (Brooks, 1967; Catherine Craver-Lemley & Reeves, 1992). The performance time required for visual perception tasks is mirrored by the time required for corresponding visual imagery tasks (Borst & Kosslyn, 2008)-see Kosslyn (1994, p. 4-10) for a summary. Visual perceptual deficits are often mirrored in one's capacity to use visual imagery(Bisiach, Luzzatti, & Perani, 1979; Levine, Warach, & Farah, 1985). 3 For much of the 1970s and 1980s, the central issue surrounding sensory imagination was the representational format of mental imagery-this was known as the \"imagery debate\" (Block, 1980). Pictorialists argued (and continue to argue) that mental imagery occurs in an iconic or pictorial representation of some kind (Kosslyn, 1994; Kosslyn & Thompson, 2003). Descriptivists countered that experimental data adduced by pictorialists is compatible with mental imagery occurring in a Fodorian language of thought (Pylyshyn, 2002). Others have developed intermediate options (Cornoldi, Logie, Brandimonte, Kaufman, & Reisberg, 1996; De Vega, Intons-Peterson, Johnson-Laird, Denis, & Marschark, 1996; Tye, 1991). 3 in a wide variety of practical reasoning tasks, whether it is in spatial reasoning (Barsalou, 1999; Cornoldi, et al., 1996; De Vega, et al., 1996; Kosslyn, Thompson, & Ganis, 2006), action-planning4, the prediction of others' behavior (Gregory Currie, 1995; Goldman, 2006), the training of motor routines (Feltz & Landers, 2007), or the development of novel technologies (Arp, 2008). But how can the deliverances of visual imagination be relied upon to guide our actions if what we imagine is subject to our whims? Consider: other mental states we rely upon to guide our actions-beliefs and perceptions-are not subject to our whims, and one might think this is precisely why they can be relied upon. Perceptual representations are reliably caused, and thereby constrained, by the world around us. Perceptual beliefs, we can assume, are directly and reliably caused by these perceptual states, inheriting their reliability from the perceptual states that cause them. Other beliefs are formed through processes of reasoning and inference, and are constrained by the principles and norms governing those processes. However difficult it is to characterize precisely these principles (be they probabilistic, deductive, inductive, or something else), it is clear that rational inference is not arbitrary or \"free\". However fallible we may be as reasoners, we cannot infer whatever we wish from p. Why, then, is visualizing a reliable way to make plans, anticipate responses, solve problems, and so on, if it is not constrained either by what is before one's eyes, or by rules of rational inference? How can we conceptualize the kinds of constraints (if any) that apply to visualization in a way that is compatible with its freedom and creativity? These queries can be sharpened into the following two questions: (1) Compatible with the usefulness and freedom of imagination, what determines (or what principles characterize) the pattern by which representations unfold during visualization; that is, what governs the relation among successive states of visualiaztion?; and, 4 Much of this work concerns similarities in the neural networks underlying episodic memory and \"imagining the future\" (see, e.g., Addis, Pan, Vu, Laiser, & Schacter, 2009; Buckner & Carroll, 2007; D. L. Schacter, Addis, & Buckner, 2007). 4 (2) Compatible with the usefulness and freedom of imagination, what determines (or what principles characterize) how those representations interact with other kinds of mental states-most importantly, with belief? I submit that, without satisfying answers to (1) and (2), we remain more or less in the dark about the role of visualization in cognition generally. In what follows I will consider a variety of strategies for answering (1) and (2), building on some proposals in the literature. Section 3 outlines and expands on Grush's (2004) emulation theory of visual imagery, using it as a scaffold for building a general approach to answering (1) and (2). Section 4 develops three specific proposals consistent with the approach of Section 3. There I cast doubt on the view that visualization should be thought of as inherently misrepresentational, as a kind of \"off-line\" perception. The freedom of imagination is the freedom to reason about topics of one's own choosing, not a freedom to represent whatever one wishes as present before one. Section 5 assesses the two remaining options. I tentatively conclude that the most promising account assimilates visualizations (and visual imaginings) to occurrent beliefs in sensorimotor generalizations; they are beliefs in the way certain kinds of sensorimotor scenarios unfold. Making this argument requires looking closely at the phenomenon of informational encapsulation as it pertains to visualization, and at our putative ability to \"imagine illusions.\" But, before coming to the three main approaches to be considered, I will briefly describe and reject two additional ways of responding to (1) and (2). This should help clarify the questions at hand and set the stage for the more nuanced accounts to come. 2. Memory and imagination 2.1. The inner DVR approach We can call one overly simple approach to answering (1) and (2) the \"inner DVR\" view ('DVR' is for 'digital video recorder'). The inner DVR view posits an especially close relation between visualization and past perceptual experience. It proposes that when we visualize we are simply re-playing (with some informational degradation, perhaps) past perceptual experiences that were \"recorded\" at the time; specific diachronic neural patterns triggered during a past act of perception are \"reactivated.\" If this were a generally 5 viable approach, it would explain (1); we could say that the representations in visualization unfold in more or less the sequence their perceptual ancestors did, and inherit their reliability (and usefulness) straightforwardly from the original perceptual acts. The obvious problem with the proposal is that it has nothing to say about the creative side of visual imagination, its ability to represent novel scenarios and thereby allow for planning and innovation through the contemplation of new possibilities. If visualization is completely tied to the past, it isn't very free at all. Visualizing would amount to choosing where to start the orderly replay of previously recorded footage. Moreover, such a view is deeply at odds with current research on episodic memory, which sees both it and imaginative visualization as primarily \"constructive\" processes, not \"literal reproduction[s] of the past\" (D.L. Schacter & Addis, 2007, p. 773).5 As wise it may be to sever both memory and imagination from the overly simplistic inner DVR view, we should not overlook the explanatory gulf that opens. For now it is far from clear how to approach answering (1) and (2), both with respect to visualization in its paradigmatically \"imaginative\" instances (what memory researchers call \"imagining the future\") and with respect to episodic memory. Despite the fact that both share underlying mechanisms with visual perception, the crucial question of what governs the transition from one state to the next cannot have the same answer for imaginative and memory states as it does for perceptual ones. We can appeal neither to a current environmental stimulus nor to a straightforward \"replaying\" of states in the order they were caused during a past perceptual episode. A very different sort of story must be told to explain the usefulness and reliability of visualization. 2.2. A lesson from theories of propositional imagination Given the problems of the inner DVR approach in answering (1), it is worth having a closer look at what comparisons can be drawn between visualization and the following of rational rules of inference of the kind that govern belief. Here it will be useful to look at some leading accounts of the cognitive architecture underlying \"propositional\" imagination. Propositional imagining occurs when someone imagines that thus and such-e.g., imagines 5 For related work on the neurological link between episodic memory and \"imagining the future,\" see Buckner & Carroll (2007), D'Argenbeau et al. (2008), Hassabis et al. (2007), Suddendorf & Corballis (2007), and Tulving (1985). 6 that the roof is on fire. This is typically contrasted to non-propositional (or \"objectual\") imagining, where a that-clause is not used in the description of the act (e.g. imagining the Eiffel Tower). While I do not think anything obvious concerning the role of mental imagery in each kind of mental act falls out of the way the acts are described (i.e. with or without a that-clause), I will assume here with others6 that propositional imagining does not involve mental imagery, and so is a distinct cognitive phenomenon from visualization and visual imagination (philosophers typically contrast the latter as a form of sensory imagination). In an influential paper and book, Nichols and Stich (2000, 2003) argue that propositional imagination involves a distinct cognitive attitude, similar to belief its inferential patterns (Currie & Ravenscroft (2002, Ch.1-2) espouse a similar view). For instance, when told to imagine that Bob was in New York yesterday and London today, one will (typically) imaginatively infer that he traveled to London by plane, just as one would infer that he travelled by plane if one simply believed he was in New York yesterday and London today and hadn't been told how he made the trip. More generally, we tend to \"fill in\" the details of imagined scenarios with what we would infer to be true if the imagined scenario were believed. The inferential \"mirroring\" is thought by Nichols and Stich to result from the same \"inference mechanism\" working on representations in the \"Belief Box\" and in the \"Possible Worlds Box,\" the latter being the cognitive \"box\" that houses the representations involved in propositional imagination (talk of cognitive \"boxes\" here is offered as a way of grouping representations that have important functional similarities). The core idea is simply that whatever mechanism or principles guide processes of inference among beliefs also guide (and thereby constrain) inferences among one's imaginings-where one's imaginings are thought of as collections of propositions quarantined in their own cognitive \"box\". Imagination is still \"free\" on these accounts, to the extent that we can insert into the Possible Worlds Box whatever we wish as the initial \"premise\" from which other inferences are drawn \"in imagination\". Once this premise is inserted, however, inferences will be drawn in imagination in more or less the same manner they would if the premise were believed. While there are important details of their account this brief sketch leaves out (including, e.g., their explanation of the many instances where imaginative inference does 6 Cf. Currie & Ravenscroft (2002); Nichols and Stich (2000). 7 not mirror the inferential patterns of belief), we can see that Nichols and Stich have at least the beginnings of a proposal for explaining (1) with respect to propositional imagining7. Given an initial imagined proposition, the sequence of propositions subsequently imagined is constrained by the same inference \"mechanism\" (or, more neutrally, rules of inference) as govern belief. If we know how to explain transitions among beliefs in broadly mechanistic terms, we know how to explain the analogous transitions among states of propositional imagination. Can this approach to answering (1) be extended to explain visualization? Defenders of such views think not, and I am inclined to agree.8 If we accept the governing assumption of these views that beliefs are all \"propositional\" or sentence-like in nature, together with the mainstream view that mental images are not-at least, not entirely (De Vega, et al., 1996; Fodor, 1975; Kosslyn, et al., 2006; Tye, 1991)-then this strongly suggests that whatever \"inference mechanism\" (or principles of inference) govern inferences among beliefs cannot be the same one that guides inferences among states of visual imagination. At very least, pursuing such an approach would require a more novel account both of belief itself and of the principles of inference governing belief than these theorists have proposed. Nevertheless, Nichols and Stich's proposal should alert us to another possibility worth considering, which is that visualizations are governed by rules of inference of a kind-just not those thought to govern belief. If there were such rules, then Nichols and Stich's approach to freedom could be adapted as well: it may consist in one's ability to choose which premises to \"feed into\" these rules. In thinking about what such rules might be like, it will help to have in hand an account of visual imagery that is broadly compatible with the idea that visualizing is constrained by principles of inference of a kind. Here we may look to Rick Grush's (2004) \"emulation\" theory. 7 This is not to say that I endorse their view. In other work (Langland-Hassan, 2011) I argue that propositional imagining involves only ordinary belief and desire. 8 Currie & Ravenscroft (2002) develop an entirely different account of sensory imagination, one which sees perception as its \"counterpart\". Nichols & Stich (2000, 2003) are silent on the role of visual imagery in their account, and have been criticized for offering no account of the role of mental imagery in imagination (Goldman, 2006). 8 3. Grush's emulation theory of visual imagery Grush's (2004) emulation theory of visual imagery can serve as a foundation upon which to build towards answering our questions (1) and (2). Grush's account serves this purpose well for three main reasons: first, it is compatible (as far as it goes) with a variety of views of visualization, including most of those that see it as a kind of \"simulation\" of visual perception; second, it is consistent with relevant neurological and psychophysical data concerning visualization (Grush, 2004, p. 367); and, third, it provides details needed for answering (1) and (2) that are left out of many other accounts-specifically, it says something about the \"rules of inference\" governing visualizations. That said, Grush's account provides only a foundation; to adequately address our puzzle, his basic picture will need to be significantly expanded in ways described below. Grush's view draws on well-known posits from control theory (e.g. \"forward models\", \"efference copies\") and signal processing theory (e.g. \"Kalman filters\"). To provide just a little of that background, it is commonly held that fast error correction for limb movements requires a process of prediction and comparison carried out subconsciously by the motor system (Blakemore, Wolpert, & Frith, 2002; Miall, Weir, Wolpert, & Stein, 1993; Wolpert, Ghahramani, & Jordan, 1995). According to this view, when a motor command is issued (e.g. \"open fist\"), an \"efference copy\" of the command is sent to a neurally realized \"forward model,\" capable of generating a prediction of the sensory consequences of the act. If the prediction issued by the forward model \"matches\" the actual \"reafferent\" sensory input (as judged by a \"comparator\" mechanism), the reafferent signal is significantly \"cancelled\" out or dampened. If, on the other hand, there is a mismatch between the prediction and input state, the sensory cancellation does not occur, and the organism is thereby alerted to change its approach. Such predictive mechanisms have been thought necessary to explain corrective arm adjustments made in grasping tasks that occur too quickly (200-300ms) to result from the visual or proprioceptive monitoring of sensory feedback (Miall et al., 1993, p. 205; 1998, p. 343; Wolpert and Ghahramani, 2000). Grush seeks to extend these ideas to visual imagery, conceiving of visual images as \"prediction\" states that can be generated in the absence of incoming sensory information with which they might be compared-in his terms, humans generate imagery \"by operating 9 emulators of the motor-visual loop\" (p. 386).9 Classical work by Sperry (1950) and von Holst (1950/1973) posited similar mechanisms in the visual systems of simple organisms (e.g. fish, flies), but did not couch the idea in terms of \"forward models\" or \"comparator\" mechanisms. Grush's idea is that visual imagining is the capacity to exploit the prediction mechanisms normally at play in visual perception, when perception of the relevant kind is not occurring. While the comparison between prediction state and reafferent input occurs below the level of consciousness during perception, visual imagery becomes conscious (i.e., is made globally available) during visualization precisely because it does not \"match\" the current input. In filling in the details of his account, Grush compares human visualization to the visuospatial reasoning of robots created by Mel (1986, 1988). These robots are trained to navigate past obstructions to reach a goal object, using visual input gained through attached video cameras. In a first stage, the robot learns (through trial and error investigation of the setup) facts about how the environment relates to its possible movements, such as \"if the visual input at t1 is x1, and motor command m1 is issued, the next visual input, at t2, will be x2\" (2004, p. 386). When enough of these mappings have been learned, the robot \"is able to solve the problems offline using visual imagery...it moves the image of its arm around by means of the same motor commands that would usually move its arm around, seeing what sequences of movement impact upon objects\" (ibid.). By learning (and storing) correlations between possible movements and visual inputs, these robots are \"able to engage in visual imagery in which [they] can mentally rotate, zoom, and pan images\" (p. 386). It is not hard to see how these ideas might be extended to human beings and visual imagery. Through interaction with the world, our visual systems are trained to \"expect\" certain kinds of inputs provided particular combinations of a present input and motor command, and are able (by exploiting a \"forward model\") to generate mental states constitutive of these predictions. Visualization may consist in generating such predictions, 9 In other work (Langland-Hassan, 2008) I question Grush's claim that visual images themselves are properly conceived of as the relevant \"predictions\" of incoming perceptual information, proposing that simpler \"filtering\" mechanisms could accomplish the same task. If that account is right, then the predictions constitutive of visualization are not the same as those discussed in work on \"forward models\" and \"corollary discharge.\" Rather, they constitute a separate, personal-level phenomenon-though perhaps one that draws on some of the same mechanisms and abilities as the signal-attenuating \"predictions\" made during ordinary perception. Here I stick to Grush's account, as it is comparably well known, and the aspects of it to which I object can ultimately be dispensed with for present purposes. 10 where the initial input is gained not through perception but through a kind of visual stipulation. After summoning an initial visual image, the subject chooses subsequent motor commands to send to the forward model, which continually generates predictions of subsequent visual states. So, supposing v1 stands for an initial visual image, and m1 a particular motor command (e.g., \"turn head to the right\"), the forward model computes a function taking v1 and m1 as input and giving v2 (a second visual image) as output, where v2 is the \"prediction\" of the sensory consequences of v1 and m1. v2 is then looped back as input to the forward model along with a second motor command m2, continuing the predictive processing so long as motor commands continue to be sent to the forward model. However, as an account of human visualization, Grush's proposal remains incomplete. Granted, Mel's robots take an important step beyond the inner DVR view, as their visualization does not consist merely in the orderly replay of pre-recorded footage; they can visualize navigating the maze along a path they haven't taken before. Nevertheless, they remain entirely tied to visualizing one specific maze; they are not able to \"break out\" of their learned correlations to visualize a new environment, one characterized by different correlations between visual inputs, motor commands, and subsequent visual states. So, something more must be said about freedom. We can potentially add in this freedom by allowing the robot to intervene \"at will\" in the unfolding of expectations, not just with a novel motor command but with a novel visual state-one which does not follow from the rules implicit in the forward model that has developed around navigating its \"home\" environment. It can then go on drawing out consequences in accordance with the forward model's algorithms from that (stipulation) state. Of course, this new stipulation state must itself be a state from which the system is prepared (given its history) to make predictions. Provided this last condition is met, the robot could be said to visualize an endless variety of novel scenarios, simply using its rules for navigating its \"home\" environment plus the ability to intervene in its own processing with a novel visual stipulation when desired-essentially \"moving the walls\" of the maze when it does so. Another limitation of Grush's appeal to Mel's robots worth mentioning is that the robots (as described) only visualize navigating static environments. Yet, in addition to static 11 environments, humans also visualize situations where they remain still and objects move in relation to them. Visualization must then involve algorithms characterizing not only how our awareness of the world changes relative to our motor commands, but also characterizing the way in which moving objects typically continue to move relative to us, and the relationship of such movements on our visual awareness of them as we potentially move as well. Here we perhaps beyond what we can expect a simple forward model to accomplish (recall, such models were initially posited only with respect to limb movements (Miall, et al., 1993; Wolpert, et al., 1995)). Nevertheless, the important point for our purposes is that we have in hand a collection of algorithms and stored representations that could plausibly serve to constrain sequences of visual imaginings in a way that is compatible with the freedom and creativity of visual imagination. Notably, the algorithms in question only involve what we can think of as visuomotor regularities, and concern simple properties like shape, location, and relative motion. Yet visualization is thought to influence reasoning across a wide variety of contexts-from theorizing about other minds to the development of complex scientific hypotheses. It is reasonable to ask how our thinking about \"higher level\" properties connects with the more basic visuomotor relations captured by the sort of algorithms so far described. I will not have space here for much speculation on the matter. My aim is less ambitious, in that I hope to develop just the beginnings of an account of visualization responsive to (1) and (2). I take it that the right starting-point in thinking about visualization is with relatively simple \"low-level\" properties; given a plausible account of how we usefully visualize these, we can go on to ask about more complex kinds of properties. For now I hope it can be agreed that we have at least the outlines of an answer to (1). We can thus turn our attention back to question (2). How are we to conceive of the functional relationships (the typical causes and effects) that hold between such \"imaginative\" states and the subject's beliefs, perceptions, and other mental states? It seems clear that, on Grush's sort of approach, visualization constitutes a kind of visuospatial reasoning, even if it is reasoning about environments never before encountered. But do the imaginative states cause judgments about the way various perceptual scenarios would unfold? Are they the judgments themselves? What are the options here? In the next section I will describe three main approaches to filling in these details. 12 Of course, there might well be approaches to (1) that reject the core tenets of the Grush-inspired view so far described; I do not mean to deny their possibility. Rather, I am proposing to move forward with a relatively clear proposal for answering (1) to see where we end up when we try account for (2) as well. 4. Three commitment views To offer an appropriately broad range of options for answering (2), I will need to introduce the notion of a commitment. A commitment is a truth-evaluable representation concerning the way the world is, as held by a thinking subject (I do not assume commitments must be occurrent or consciously held). Beliefs are paradigm cases of commitments, though they arguably form only a subset of one's commitments. Perceptual representations are also plausibly commitments; they represent the world to be a certain way, though (I will assume) are not to be identified with belief (here I follow philosophical convention (Siegel, 2008); see Sec. 5 for more on the relation between perception and belief). Notably, beliefs in generalizations (or ceteris paribus beliefs) are commitments, whatever their peculiarities. To believe that birds fly and trees have leaves is to believe truths about the way our world is, even if many birds don't fly and some tress lack leaves. Using the notion of a commitment, we can describe three options for approaching (2), each of which is consistent with the view outlined in Section 3. On the first two views, visualizations constitute occurrent commitments about the way certain kinds of scenarios unfold; we can think of them as commitments concerning sensorimotor generalizations (details to come). The difference between these two options consists in whether the commitments are considered beliefs, or some other kind of commitment (\"quasiperceptual\" commitments, perhaps). I will call the former approach the Belief View (\"BV\") of visualization; to my knowledge, no one has previously defended such a view. The latter I will call the \"Impinging Generalization\" (\"IG\") view of visualization. It is an \"impinging\" view to the extent that it sees visualizations, like perceptual representations, as belief-distinct commitments that impinge on one's web of belief from without, typically causing beliefs with related contents. A second kind of impinging view (and our third option) holds that visualizing strictlyspeaking involves misrepresenting one's actual environment, for it involves representing as 13 present a variety of things that are typically not present. I will call this the Misrepresentational Impinging View (\"MRI\"). This is a commitment view because it holds that visualizations represent various objects as present before one; however, because these commitments are not appropriately tied to action guiding systems (they are triggered \"offline\"), they do not lead to wildly mistaken behavior. Instead, such willful misrepresentations tend to cause beliefs about how certain scenarios generally unfold (or would unfold); hence its status with IG as an \"impinging\" view, influencing one's web of belief from without. MRI is motivated by the thought that visualization involves much the same kind of mental state as visual perception, and that perceptual states represent their objects as present. The difference between MRI and IG lies in the correctness conditions each attributes to visualization: IG holds that visualizations are veridical to the extent that certain kinds of scenarios unfold in a certain way; MRI holds that visualizations are veridical to the extent that the world right before one is a certain way (and therefore are almost always non-veridical). A fourth option would be to deny that visualizations are commitments at all. One might insist that visualizations are simply not truth-evaluable. I set this option aside for the time being, as it is not compatible with the Grush-inspired approach to answering (1) developed in the previous section. For if it is true that sequences of visualization are governed by a set of predictive algorithms, then such sequences are plainly calculations of a kind and, as such, aim to calculate something correctly. Holding that visualization is, in general, a sequence of non-truth-evaluable representations simply opens up again the question of how we are to answer (1). I will, however, have more to say about the nontruth-evaluable proposal below (Sect. 4.5). For now I turn to further explicating the three approaches just described, beginning with BV.10 4.1. The Belief View of visualization (\"BV\") 10 If \"simulating\" perception just amounts to using perceptual centers of the brain in reasoning that is not driven by an external stimulus, then all three views are consistent with the claim that visualizing is simulating visual perception. What I am trying to make clear is that there are important questions about the representational and functional properties of visualization that remain open even once we have accepted a very broad simulation view. Those more exacting in their use of the term 'simulation' (Currie & Ravenscroft, 2002, Ch. 5) may justly question whether visualization is properly thought of as a simulation of perception. 14 According to BV, visualizing consists in making occurrent judgments concerning visuomotor generalizations, where these judgments are beliefs. It sees visualization as on a par with mathematical reasoning. In line with the approach to (1) described in Section 3, an initial visual image is taken together with an efference-copy motor command as input to a complex function, governed by sensorimotor algorithms. The output of the function is a subsequent visual image, itself combined with a further motor command and fed back into the function, and so on continually. It is the diachronic sequence of this reasoning that is truth evaluable, and that constitutes the relevant belief-not the individual states. By analogy to mathematical reasoning, one does not form truth-evaluable representations as a means to accomplishing the reasoning in question. When I add 245 to 342, I do not need to represent that 245 is added to 342 as a kind of truth-evaluable hypothetical supposition entertained along the way to arriving at the answer. I simply carry out the operation \"in my head\" to the best of my abilities, using whatever algorithms or heuristics I have at my disposal, and conclude that the answer is 587. The reasoning process as a whole is assessable for accuracy and, plausibly, constitutes my occurrent judgment that 245 plus 342 equals 587. Of course, if I add these two numbers often enough, I might also acquire a stored belief that 245 plus 342 equals 587, one that could be recalled without my needing to do any addition in my head. But that is not the normal case. For most such problems, I have to go through with the calculation in order to render an occurrent judgment; I simply don't have any commitments about the answers in question independent of my ability to go through with the calculations. For me to have \"implicit\" beliefs about such mathematical propositions just is for me to be disposed (given my algorithms and heuristics, etc.) to arrive at such occurrent judgments. Similarly, visualizing scoring a goal in a soccer match can be seen as \"working out\" the problem of how things would go in such a circumstance, using visual as opposed to arithmetic representations and algorithms.11 Suppose, as above, that v1 stands for the initial visual image, m1 the initial motor command, and v2 the subsequent visual image that is generated in accord with the relevant algorithms. According to BV, neither v1 nor v2 (nor 11 We can assume that the role of a visual imagining here is not to represent a situation as it would really look if it occurred (i.e., in all of its detail), but rather to get certain coarse-grained features right. That is, an imagining can be veridical to the extent that it does not \"say\" things that are false, even if it is representationally silent about many matters that a corresponding visual perception would not be. 15 their sequence) represent anything as present in the visualizer's immediate environment; v1 and v2 considered singly are not truth-evaluable at all. Rather, the dynamic sequence of v1 and m1 generating v2 is the truth-evaluable entity, for it constitutes the organism's commitment that a certain kind of visuomotor scenario would unfold in a particular way- its commitment that v1 plus m1 equals m2. For clarity, it may help to translate (very roughly) the proposed representational contents into natural language, as follows: v1 = \"a foot pulled back at angle t to strike a ball\"; m1 = \"swing foot forward at angle r\"; v2 = \"a foot striking a ball at angle s\". v1 and v2 do not purport to represent a foot and ball as present before one; they just represent a foot and a ball in different relationships to each other. Considering the processingsequence as a whole, however, we can think of it as akin to a belief in a generalization of the form: \"A foot pulled back at angle t and a motor command to swing the foot forward at angle r results in a foot striking a ball at angle s.\" To be clear, the suggestion is not that the belief itself has propositional or sentential structure, only that the processing sequence has comparable truth conditions to such a belief. Intuitively, one is just reasoning that a foot moving toward a ball at a certain angle results in its hitting the ball at a certain angle; this is a commitment about the way a certain kind of visuomotor situation would unfold. That one is disposed to reason in this way (given one's algorithms) amounts to saying that one implicitly believes the generalization in question. Going through with the reasoning amounts to making that implicit belief explicit or \"occurrent.\" Obviously, the belief can be either true or false. But, either way, BV grants that in going through with this reasoning one has \"successfully\" imagined scoring a goal, since imagining scoring a goal amounts (on the present view) to reasoning about scoring a goal, whether the reasoning is good or bad.12 BV requires that one can have beliefs with mental images as constituents. I will discuss some reasons one might resist that idea below. In the meantime, we can see 12 This means we can accept the point that a single \"static\" image or \"cognitive map\" cannot by itself represent a conditional (Bermudez, 2009, p. 162), while insisting that diachronic sequences of images whose unfolding is governed by probabilistic predictive algorithms can plausibly constitute such representations. That said, there is space for what we might call \"single\" or \"static\" image imaginings to have truth values according to BV as well. This might occur when a certain visual image forms a proper part of a larger content, such as: my childhood home looked like: H (where H is the contribution of a single visual image). Or, looking to the future: when John opens his present, his expression will be: J. Centered as it is around answering (1), this paper focuses on the truth conditions arising out of diachronic sequences of visualization. 16 roughly what the answer to (2) would be on this approach: these states of visualization just are beliefs, so they interact with beliefs, desires, and action-guiding systems as would any other beliefs in generalizations (modulo the involvement of visual imagery). The freedom of imagination, on BV, is explained as indicated in Section 3. At any point in the reasoning processes the subject can intervene to insert a visual image that does not follow from the algorithms that generally govern visualization. When this happens, the visualization's truth conditions should be assessed beginning from the point at which the intervention occurred, and ending before any further intervention. For at the point of the intervention one has stopped trying to reason about how the initial kind of visuomotor scenario would go; one is \"starting over\" with a new (if connected) reasoning project. Of course, there may be an important cognitive point to the larger imaginative project, where the larger project contains the various interventions within it-interventions which allow one to represent an overall situation not previously perceived. The point is simply that in assessing the correctness conditions of the imaginative project, we must sometimes look at individual \"pieces\" of it-those that occur in-between stipulative interventions-for only these aspects are subject to the kinds of constraints that are suitable to give rise to correctness conditions in the first place. 4.2 The Impinging Generalization View (\"IG\") IG holds that visualizations have the same representational contents and correctness conditions as according to BV. There is no presumption that such states are misrepresentational, since, as with BV, they are veridical to the extent that they accurately reflect the way a certain kind of situation generally unfolds (and not to the extent that they represent how the world actually is before one). Again they constitute commitments because they are generated out of predictive, probabilistic algorithms whose nature it is to try to get these generalizations right. Also, as with BV, we can say that a person whose visualization misrepresents the way a particular kind of visuomotor scenario would unfold nevertheless imagines that scenario, since imagining is simply visual reasoning (good or bad). And both IG and BV account for the freedom of imagination in the same way. The key difference with IG is that it denies visualizations are beliefs (I will say more about why one might deny they are beliefs in Section 5). This difference calls for a 17 difference in our answer to (2). Visualizations obviously need to interact with our beliefs in order to play the role they do in practical reasoning; if visualizations are not themselves occurrent beliefs, then they need to somehow transfer their contents to belief. We might conceptualize the relation by analogy to the relation between perception and belief: just as perceiving that there is a tree to the right typically causes a belief that there is a tree to the right, visualizing my foot striking the soccer ball (that is, the diachronic sequence of such) perhaps causes a belief in a conditional of the form \"if I swung my foot forward just so, thus and such would happen,\" or in a comparable generalization. I will come back in Section 5 to discuss this aspect of IG in relation to BV, considering how the \"imagistic\" portion of visualization might transfer its contents to belief. The remainder of this section is devoted to assessing MRI and its relation to IG. 4.3. The Misrepresentational Impinging View (\"MRI\") The second impinging view, MRI, sees visualization as always involving mental states that are strictly-speaking non-veridical. They are non-veridical because they are straightforward indicative representations about how the world is before one, akin to one's perceptual representations; since the world before one's eyes is rarely if ever the way one's visualizations represent it to be, one's visualizations are typically non-veridical. Nevertheless, it is in virtue of more or less the same set of rules or algorithms as posited for BV and IG that an initial visual image is followed by an ordered sequence of others, making it consistent with the architecture described in Section 3. Freedom is also accounted for in the same way as with BV and IG-the subject can intervene at will to insert a state that does not \"follow\" from visualization's predictive algorithms. An important addendum to MRI is that the states it posits are cut off from action-guiding systems-they are in this sense \"offline\". If they were not, they would presumably lead to hallucinatory behavior; one would act though if everything one was imagining was happening before one.13 Instead, (and in partial answer to (2)) their main output is (typically) to cause 13 One might argue that even if such misrepresentational states were not \"cut off\" from action guiding systems, they would not give rise to hallucinatory behavior because they are easily distinguished from perceptual experiences by their impoverished representational contents (that is, they are phenomenologically \"dim\"). But this then begs the question of whether they are properly characterized as representing their objects as present in the first place, since even when not isolated from action-guiding systems they have no tendency to cause behavior appropriate to the presence of the objects represented. 18 a belief that a certain scenario would unfold in a particular way. So, it would seem they have the same typical effects on belief as those proposed for IG. So much for a quick summary of the three approaches. My sense is that most would initially favor both MRI and IG over BV, and then MRI over IG. I have not attributed the views to specific theorists, however, since each view goes into more details concerning the precise representational characteristics of visualization than are specified in other accounts. However, Currie (1995) seems clearly to defend an MRI-style view when, having argued that visualizing amounts to simulating visual perception, he concludes that visual imagery \"should also have a content that is potentially the content of a visual [perceptual] experience...the simulationist will say that the content of visual imagery is always of the form, 'That I am seeing such-and-such'\" (p. 36-37). And, to the extent that Gordon (1986, 1992) and others see visualization as occurring \"off-line\", they are implicitly committed to MRI and its view that visualization is inherently misrepresentational (why else would it need to occur off-line-that is, quarantined from action-guiding systems?). Rollins's (1989, Ch. 5) account of \"pictorial attitudes\" may however represent a relatively rare case of an IG-style view. And while some philosophers have explicitly denied MRI's claim that visual images represent their targets as present (McGinn, 2004; Sarte, 1966) and to this extent sympathize with IG and BV, they have not gone on to develop a positive account of what visualization's representational properties are in a way that would allow for an answer to questions (1) and (2). So it is difficult to assess what they would make of our three options. In any event, I turn now to assessing IG against MRI. 4.4. IG vs. MRI The most important difference between IG and MRI lies in how they view the correctness conditions of the collective states of visualization; I will argue here that IG's approach is preferable. However tempting it may be at first glance, MRI's core commitment that visualizing involves (dimly?) misrepresenting one's actual environment is problematic. The question of whether a mental state represents its target as present is plausibly a matter of its functional 19 role, and visualizations do not under any normal circumstances lead to behavior appropriate to the visualized objects being present before one. Sure, one could insist that the \"real\" functional role of such states is disguised by the fact that they occur \"off-line\"; but the question is why we should think visualization is misrepresentational in the first place. Why posit these epicycles? Some might think Perky's (1910) famous experiment, where subjects reported that objects dimly (and unexpectedly) projected on a screen were their own imaginings (the socalled \"Perky effect\"), constitutes evidence that visual imaginings, like visual perception, represent their objects as present. But, if this is evidence that imaginings and perceivings both represent their objects as present, then we have far more evidence that imaginings do nothing of the sort, since the confusion hardly ever occurs; every non-confused imagining is evidence against the hypothesis. In any case, the instances of confusion can be attributed to shared representational characteristics, without going so far as to conceive of imagining as inherently misrepresentational. For instance, both visualizing and visual perception may synchronically represent colors and shapes in fixed three-dimensional coordinates, say, and do so at least partially in a 'depictive' or iconic format; and it may be a feature of both that, for any two parts of an object represented, the parts are represented as being in some determinate spatial relationship to each other. Such representational similarities are sufficient to account for the \"phenomenal\" similarity between the two. Further, it bears emphasis that visual imagery may re-use the visual system (Anderson, forthcoming), without completely duplicating the representational characteristics of visual perception. Note also that, notwithstanding claims of philosophers to the contrary, Perky's results have proven difficult to replicate. The closest cases are described by Segal (1971), who notes that she was forced to give subjects a placebo, which they were told was a \"relaxant\", before some would claim that projected images were their own mental images. Segal adds that some subjects apparently viewed the placebo as a kind of hallucinogen, as they would continue to claim the projected images were mental images even once the intensity of the stimulus was raised well above threshold (1971, p. 77). Moreover, the question of whether the Perky effect is a genuine phenomenon is further confounded by the fact that some psychologists use 'the Perky effect' to refer to the interference of visual imagery tasks on concurrent visual perception tasks (C. Craver-Lemley & Reeves, 1987; 20 Catherine Craver-Lemley & Reeves, 1992), for which there is ample evidence, while philosophers typically use 'the Perky effect' to name the supposed tendency of subjects to mistake an imagining for a perceiving. A more subtle argument, however, might be offered in favor of MRI, to the effect that the forward model-based conception of imagery developed in Section 3 requires visual images (conceived of as \"predictions\" of sensory input) to have the same representational properties as the reafferent perceptual states they predict, if they are to appropriately match those states when assessed by the comparator. If perceptual representations represent their objects as present, so too (one might argue) should visual images. However, according to theories invoking forward models and comparator mechanisms, the relevant predictions and comparisons happen below the level of consciousness; indeed, they shape and partly determine the nature of downstream conscious perceptual experience. At the pre-conscious level at which these representations are \"compared,\" it is reasonable to think that neither form of representation (proto-perceptual or imagistic) yet represents its object as present; rather, both may have generalized, non-truth-evaluable contents of the kind considered above, e.g.: a ball moving left; or, a table receding to the right. If conscious perceptual representations represent their objects as present, this representational feature may be acquired downstream from such comparisons. Another reason one might favor MRI over IG derives from the idea that, in order to find out what would happen if p, we must represent that p is the case \"off-line\" and see what we come to infer. This view of hypothetical reasoning is typically advanced as a part of theories of propositional imagination (Currie & Ravenscroft (2002, Ch. 1-2); Nichols and Stich (2000); Gordon (1992, p. 92)). On these views, hypothetical reasoning involves representing (\"offline\") the hypothetical situation as actually occurring, and then seeing \"what emerges as reasonable\" (Currie & Ravenscroft, 2002). So, for instance, in order to determine what will happen if it rains on the parade, say, one represents \"it is raining on the parade\" offline from action-guiding systems and, similarly offline, draws a number of inferences, such as: people are getting wet, the floats are flooding, the drum-major is 21 wearing a poncho, etc. Based on these misrepresentational14 offline indicative inferences, one then forms the conditional belief: if it rains on the parade, then people will get wet, the floats will flood, the drum-major will wear a poncho, etc Suppose we grant that propositional hypothetical reasoning15-and even visualization-could conceivably proceed in this manner. Is the view inevitable? I think not. I argue elsewhere (Langland-Hassan, 2011) that a simpler account, involving only ordinary belief and desire, is possible. Nor, I should add, do its proponents in the case of propositional imagination argue it is the only way that hypothetical reasoning could take place (see, e.g., Nichols et al. (1996)). Rather, they advance their views of imagination on other grounds (e.g. to explain childhood pretense (Nichols and Stich, 2000)), noting that the posited architecture could also be deployed in (propositional) hypothetical reasoning. Consider again an analogy to mathematical reasoning: to determine the answer to 245 plus 346, do I need to represent 245 plus 346 \"off-line\" and see what I come to infer? Surely not-I can just carry out the calculation \"online\", using whatever heuristics and algorithms I have for accomplishing addition. If visualization is comparable in the ways already suggested, then there is no reason to treat it differently (however one wishes to treat propositional hypothetical reasoning). Imagining someone hitting a baseball with bat involves an initial visual image v1 (of a bat hitting the ball at a certain angle) that is fed into algorithms governing how a ball would likely move as a result, together with algorithms governing how subsequent motor commands would effect what is seen, and so on, resulting in an output that then becomes the input to further \"reasoning\". This hypothetical reasoning process about the way certain kinds of visuomotor scenarios unfold is on-line and assessable for accuracy; we should not think of it as misrepresentational and \"off-line\" any more than mathematical reasoning is misrepresentational and \"off-line\". It is worth emphasizing as a further virtue of both IG and BV over MRI that on both IG and BV we can hold that an instance of visualizing is veridical or not to the extent that it constitutes good (visual) reasoning. This ties the veridicality conditions of visualization straightforwardly to the impact of those states in successfully guiding behavior. Those 14 Harris (2001) explicitly voices the common assumption that such representations are misrepresentations, when he notes that the counterfactual reasoning guiding pretense depends \"on the ability to temporarily entertain a representation that is non-veridical, and known to be so\" (p. 252). 15 I argue at length against such a view of hypothetical reasoning elsewhere (Langland-Hassan, 2011). 22 attracted to teleological accounts of content-holding that the content of a state is best determined by what it helps us (or helped our ancestors) do-should find this a considerable advantage. MRI is unnecessarily awkward in this regard, holding that all visualizations are themselves non-veridical, yet often enough result in true beliefs about how certain kinds of scenarios would go. It draws too strong a parallel between perceptual representation and imagination than is warranted by any obvious consideration. 4.5. A last word about freedom A last reason one might favor MRI over IG and BV (or at any rate mistrust IG and BV) is tied to the freedom of imagination. According to IG and BV, all visualization consists in making and/or rendering occurrent commitments-be they beliefs or commitments of another kind. This follows from the view of visualization as a kind of visual reasoning. Philosophers especially may chafe at this part of the account. Is it really at all plausible to think that all visual imagining amounts to making judgments about how a particular kind of situation would go? Can't we imagine things going all sorts of ways we think they wouldn't go? Isn't that precisely what distinguishes visual imagination from visual hypothetical reasoning (supposing we allow for the latter)? Of course, IG and BV have things to say about freedom-and these are essentially the same things MRI says. The freedom of imagination consists in our ability to interrupt the pattern of visual inferences that follow from the above-described algorithms to insert a new visual image (or short sequence of images) as a premise for further reasoning. For instance, supposing I visualize letting go of a baseball and, instead of imagining it falling to the ground, I imagine it shooting up into the sky. This is not what I judge would happen if I let go of a baseball. But, IG and BV respond, it is what I judge would happen if I let go of a ball and it began to go upwards at a great rate. In imagining the ball flying upwards, I have intervened in the default mode of imagining dropping a ball to carry out inferences about how a different sort of scenario would unfold-one where the ball flew upwards (on MRI one interrupts to carry out inferences about how a different scenario is unfolding before one). To the extent that the subsequent development of images is constrained by algorithms governing motorcommands and their relation to visual input, the dynamics of moving objects, and so on, the sequence remains assessable for accuracy. As remarked above, we \"start over\" in assessing 23 the veridicality of the visualization at each point where there is an intervention, as these in effect mark the boundaries of appropriately constrained reasoning processes. Now, one may not care in certain cases of visualization whether one is \"getting it right\"-that is, whether one's imaginings veridically represent the way the imagined scenario would unfold. And the more one intervenes with visual \"stipulations\" that replace the default algorithms' output, the more likely one is not to care. In some cases the larger point of the visualization may merely be self-entertainment, not problem-solving. But the visualizations may have correctness conditions and constitute commitments all the same; you are visually reasoning even when you don't especially care whether you get the right result. In addition, we must bear in mind that commitments come in many degrees of strength. Visualizations that extend well beyond what we have previously perceived may constitute only tentative commitments, just as guesses about the future can in general be tentative. But again, we can still consider them commitments; by doing so, we retain an answer to (1) and (2). According to IG, BV and MRI, the only way to completely avoid making (or activating) commitments during visualization is for the visualization to, at each step, consist in a visual stipulation-no image \"following\" from another via relevant algorithms. It seems clear that this is not how visualization normally proceeds, though the possibility of such episodes should not be dismissed. BV and IG would hold that such visualizations are not truth-evaluable, for here we would simply have a succession of images with non-truth evaluable contents such as \"a white ball...a green rake...a blue moon.\" For it is only in combination with algorithms whose nature it is to predict subsequent images from prior ones that diachronic patterns of visualizations come to constitute calculations of a kind- calculations that by their very nature aim to get something right. Where a purely stipulative imagining is not truth-evaluable, it will not constitute a commitment; we will then expect it to have negligible cognitive effects (i.e. it will not be useful). This does not threaten our response to (1) and (2), so long as most visualization is not of this nature. MRI, by contrast, would hold that such purely \"stipulative\" imaginings are, like all imaginings, misreprentational; that MRI does not capture in its account of correctness conditions the difference between such an imagining and a useful one is a weakness of the approach. 24 But suppose that one maintained that most (or all) visualizations lack truth values completely. This might seem an attractive way of preserving the intuition that visualizing does not involve forming commitments of any kind. I don't suppose many psychologists would espouse such a view, but it may well capture the sympathies of some philosophers (see, e.g., McGinn, 2004, p. 21; Searle, 1983). The obvious problem here is that in adopting a non-commitment view of visualization as our general approach, we lose our accounts of both (1) and (2). If each step of a visualization is determined by a kind of willful stipulation, then there are no general principles governing how any particular image will develop across time in visualization. Nor have we any idea how the procession of such images could profitably influence belief in the many instances of practical reasoning where visualization is implicated; for it would be constrained by nothing other than one's stipulative wishes. Holding that visualization is entirely (or even predominantly) stipulative is, from the perspective of cognitive science, a non-starter. Let me try to put this point in another way, in response to a comment from a referee. A tempting view of visualization sees sequences of visual images as not themselves constituting commitments, but rather as offering candidate beliefs, or fodder for belief fixation. The idea is that in visualization we can \"try out\" a variety of scenarios without these rehearsals reflecting or constituting any kind of commitment. When one of these \"candidates\" seems especially plausible or compelling, we may form a corresponding belief, and only then arrive at any sort of commitment. Now, such an approach has likely given up on answering (1), which should be enough to stop us in our tracks. Setting that aside, we have the difficult question of what determines which candidates inspire belief, and which will not (this is question (2)). The only answer would seem to be that a visualization will inspire belief when it coheres with or relevantly \"matches\" a preexisting belief. But this renders the visualization itself otiose, for we already knew what the visualization is telling us. The usefulness of visualization is unexplained. However, lacking any such belief to match with candidate visualizations, it remains entirely unclear how and why some visualizations inspire belief while others do not. Nevertheless, an important concession can be made in response to those convinced that visualization is too \"free\" to constitute commitments of any kind. Often visualization is driven not so much by a conscious intention to solve a particular \"problem\", but rather by 25 what we might call \"associative\" principles that vary depending on individual psychologies. For instance, the way that daydream fantasies play out typically has less to do with solving a visuospatial problem, more to do with exploring possibilities that one finds pleasant or otherwise of interest. Let us call the two different kinds of causes of visualization \"intentions to determine\" in the first case, and \"desires to explore\" in the latter. The different kinds of cause will impact the kinds of contents that are visualized, desires to explore often resulting in contents that depart more radically from the everyday. The more fanciful the subject matter of the visualizing, the more we may be tempted to think it does not constitute a commitment of any kind. But we should resist that temptation, for the different kinds of causes and different characteristic contents need have no bearing on whether the processing is a kind of reasoning, constitutive of one's commitments. Reasoning about fantastical scenarios and distant possibilities is reasoning all the same.16 By resisting the temptation to deny lighthearted reasoning about fantastical scenarios as a kind of reasoning, we preserve our answers to (1) and (2), and so have the beginnings of an account of visualization's functional role within a broader cognitive economy. 4.6 MRI dismissed As should be clear by now, MRI is no better suited than IG and BV to account for the kind of radical freedom-freedom from constituting any kind of commitment-that some might wish to attribute imaginings. After all, MRI accounts for freedom in the same way as IG and BV, by allowing stipulations to occasionally intervene in the processing governed by various algorithms. MRI maintains that visualization is otherwise constrained by the same algorithms as IG and BV, and therfore constitutes a kind of visual reasoning. The difference is that its outputs are all strictly-speaking misrepresentational and are 16 What about dreams? Don't dreams involve visualization? And isn't it far-fetched to suppose that we are involved in reasoning processes during dreams? Here I would insist that the will-driven process of visualization is not the same mental phenomenon as dreaming, even if (as with visual perception) many of the same cortical areas are active during dreaming as during visualization. While both dreams and visualizations feature mental imagery and are endogenously caused, their specific causes are likely quite different, as are obviously their effects. For one thing, subjects engaged in visualization (even in its \"daydreaming\" instances) have a clear sense of the difference between what they are current perceiving and what they are visualizing-a necessary condition for the visualization to play its typical causal role. This difference between visualizing and dreaming demands any functionalist account of mind to treat them as different kinds of processes. Nevertheless, I grant that the \"desires to explore\" responsible for some visualizations may play a causal role in the development of some dreams. Unfortunately, I lack the space here for a properly detailed account of the difference between visualization and dreaming. 26 generated \"off-line\". One does not gain any extra measure of freedom by conceiving of the sequence of representations in this way-they are commitments all the same, albeit ones (like known illusions) that are believed to be false. On such a view, one is still reasoning about how a certain scenario would unfold-rather, is unfolding-it's just that one is reasoning that the scenario is occurring in front of one, while \"resisting\" the mild illusion. Once it is clear that MRI is no better suited than IG or BV to satisfy the intuition that visual imagination flies free of our actual commitments, and that the similarity of visualization to visual perception need not entail that both represent their objects as present, much of MRI's appeal relative to IG falls away. MRI unnecessarily divorces the correctness conditions of visualization from its role in guiding behavior, while explaining no features of visualization that IG cannot also accommodate. While more could undoubtedly be said in the debating the merits of each, I propose to move forward to consider IG in relation to BV. 5. Illusion and encapsulation Many will balk at assimilating visualization to a kind of occurent belief, in accord with BV. While I won't be able to touch on all the possible reasons for this resistance, I want to show that BV is not as implausible as it might seem. I want to leave BV a viable contender among other options. Most of the reasons one would prefer IG to BV are, I think, essentially the same reasons one would resist assimilating perception to belief. I do not aim to deny the traditional distinction between perception and belief. Rather, in making a limited case for BV, I will argue that the most obvious reasons for distinguishing between perception and belief do not extend to the case of visualization and belief. First, the matter of representational format might seem to pose an acute problem for BV. It is often held the representations underlying human thought must be compositional and systematic. While there are many ways of understanding these notions, the rough idea is that human thoughts are composed of constituent concepts, and that for each thought there is a \"canonical decomposition\"-one way of divvying it up that reveals its constituent structure (i.e. its basic parts). This compositionality is held to explain the apparent systematicity of human thought (i.e., the (purported) fact that anyone who can 27 think that a is F and b is G can also think that a is G and b is F) and its productivity (i.e., the ability of humans to entertain an unlimited variety of thoughts, while having a necessarily limited representational store). By contrast, it is often held that perceptual representations (and perhaps mental images) are 'iconic', where this means they lack a canonical decomposition; there is no single way of \"cutting up\" an iconic representation into parts and, by extension, no clear explanation of systematicity (see., e.g. Fodor (2003, Ch. 2)). If the representations underlying beliefs all have canonical decompositions, and visual images do not (let us suppose they are iconic), then we have an obvious problem assimilating visualizations to belief. It is beyond the scope of this paper to weigh in on the (empirical) question of whether mental images fail tests of compositionality and systematicity. However, without making any assumptions one way or another about their underlying format, it is not obvious that they do. Plausibly enough, anyone who can visualize a red hen and a green rake can also visualize a green hen and a red rake; and anyone who can visualize John hugging Mary can visualize Mary hugging John, and so on. One reason some might think visualizations fail compositionality is that, like perceptual experience, they have nonconceptual content. In a way, this just restates the claim that visualizations lack compositional structure, since (in line with Evans's (1982, Ch. 4) generality constraint17), the mark of conceptual content is often held to be that someone who conceptually thinks that a is F and that b is G must be able also to think that b is F and a is G. However, the standard arguments for nonconceptual content seem not to extend to visualizations. Debates about nonconceptual content typically center on the observation that we can perceive and discriminate far more colors than we have concepts for (and, plausibly, beliefs about), and that therefore the content of such perceptions must be at least partly nonconceptual. On the face of it, visualization doesn't represent properties as finely grained as perception; it doesn't seem that we can form distinct visual images for every shade of color we can perceptually discriminate. Moreover, supposing evidence arose that we are able to visualize fine-grained differences in color-reliably visualizing red38 and red40 with representationally distinct visual images, say, as a means of solving reasoning 17 Roughly speaking, the generality constraint on concept possession requires that anyone who can conceptually think that a is F can and that b is G can also conceptually think that a is G and that b is F (in short one's mental states constitutes concepts only if they are systematic). 28 tasks concerning the two colors-this would simply be evidence that we have the concepts of those colors after all. So typical considerations linking fineness of grain and nonconceptual content do not transfer over to visualization. Further, in recent work on animal cognition, Rescorla (2009) shows how iconic \"cognitive maps\" capable of receiving probabilistic weightings can be used in deductive reasoning tasks that have traditionally been thought to require a systematic, combinatorial mentalese; and Carruthers (2009) argues that humans share \"quick and dirty\" \"system-1\" reasoning processes with animals, and that these processes both satisfy a plausible construal of the generality constraint and constitute our genuine beliefs and desires (he contrasts distinctively human \"system-2\" thought as faux-thought). If mental images are relevantly like cognitive maps and can play a role both in deductive inference and satisfy defensible interpretations of the generality constraint, then whatever differences they may have with natural language representations may have little bearing on whether they are suitable constituents of belief. But let us, for the sake of argument, assume that mental images lack canonical decompositions, fail tests of systematicity, and have nonconceptual content. The key question then becomes whether all beliefs must have canonical decompositions and purely conceptual content. The fact that we have beliefs that require a compositional, systematic \"mentalese\" does not require that the representations underlying all of our beliefs are compositional or systematic. Thus, arguments for the compositional and systematic nature of human thought are not arguments that a subset of one's beliefs cannot involve iconic representations as constituents, or have nonconceptual contents. Granted, admitting iconic representations into the realm of belief raises large questions concerning the principles by which these representations combine and interact with representations that do have canonical decompositions. Traditionally, one of the motivations for holding that beliefs have compositional structure has been that it allows for a tidy picture where rational inference consists in operations over uninterpreted symbols mimicking the inference rules of formal logic (where the expressions of formal logic have analogous constituent structure). Allowing into belief representations without canonical decompositions throws a wrench into these works. 29 In response, most theorists accept that the wrench is already there, to the extent that much human reasoning is clearly not guided by rules of inference analogous to those of formal logic (more on this below). And most leading theories of visual imagery already hold that visualization involves iconic and descriptive elements working in tandem, which helps to explain how visualization has a more determinate content than would be possible if it featured iconic representations exclusively.18 Given the very close relation envisioned here between the iconic and the discursive, the idea that belief can contain both kinds of representation under its umbrella seems relatively conservative. Finally, everyone concerned to explain the usefulness of visualization has to account for the inferential interaction between visualizations and the beliefs that do satisfy tests of compositionality and systematicity (and indeed between iconic perceptual representations and belief). This is not a burden peculiar to BV. Of course, one may insist that this particular problem should be enshrined in our terminology, by using 'belief' for the commitments that are relevantly compositional and systematic, and some other term for the commitments that are not. At this point, the dispute is merely terminological. I note, however, that the terminological decision to use 'belief' in this way does not fall straightforwardly out of common sense or folk psychology. (And again, this is all assuming, for the sake of argument, that mental images do fail relevant tests of compositionality). The best case I can see against mixing visualization and belief traces to the phenomenon of informational encapsulation; and I think, for many, this gets to the core of the intuitive resistance to BV. In Fodor's (1983, 2000) term, perceptual representations are \"encapsulated\" with respect to one's beliefs, in the sense that informational exchanges between the two are asymmetrical (2000, p. 62-63).19 One's beliefs are subject to influence by what one perceptually represents, but not the other way around. The asymmetry is easily illustrated by appeal to visual illusions. Take the well-known Müller- 18 See, e.g. Fodor's (1975) notion of images \"under a description\", Tye's (1991) symbol-filled interpreted arrays, Reisberg's (1996) images set in \"reference frames\", and Johnson-Laird's (1996) \"mental models.\" 19 Carruthers (2006) understands encapsulation similarly: \"To say that a processing system is encapsulated is to say that its internal operations can't draw on any information held outside of that system in addition to its input\" (p. 5). 30 Lyer illusion, where two equal-length lines appear to be different lengths, due to the different orientation of arrows at the ends of each. Someone can know that the two lines presented are the same length, and can be a model of rationality, even while perceptually representing the lines as being different lengths-for perceptual representations are immune to change or \"revison\" in response to belief contents. Perceptual representations, then, cannot be beliefs; for a fundamental feature of beliefs is that they are sensitive to influence and revision in the light of contrasting beliefs.20 If visual imagination is quasi-perceptual in the specific sense that its contents are encapsulated from belief, then, arguably, it too cannot be a kind of belief. Now, if MRI were the correct view of visualization, there would be a strong parallel between visualizing and knowingly viewing an illusion. For all visualizations would plausibly constitute cases of visually representing the environment in front of one as being a way it is believed not to be; the very possibility of unconfused visualization would seem to require its encapsulation from belief. But, as we saw in Section 4, there is no reason to think that visualization is inherently misrepresentational; there is no reason to favor MRI over IG. The temptation to call visualization misrepresentational is grounded in the mistaken view that the freedom of imagination is dependent upon an ability to represent as present whatever we wish. But, as we saw, MRI affords no greater freedom for imagination than IG or BV. And if there is no reason to think that visualizations are inherently misrepresentational, then there is no reason to assume they will conflict with one's beliefs in the way that perceptual representations of visual illusions often do. And that means there is no obvious reason to think visualizations must be informationally encapsulated from belief. With this in mind, let us look more closely at the phenomenon of visual illusions as they pertain to imagination. For there are many reports in the psychological literature of visual illusions being \"mirrored\" or \"replicated\" in visual imagination (Finke, 1989; Pressey & Wilson, 1974; Wallace, 1984).21 But what does it mean to say that an illusion is mirrored or replicated in imagination? What is it to imagine an illusion? Illusions occur when a person misperceives an object or property as being some way that it is not- 20 This may be only a norm regarding belief-one that is violated often enough by normal reasoners. See Bortolotti (2009) for useful discussion. 21 See Resiberg & Morris (1986) and Pylyshyn (2002) for skepticism concerning such studies. 31 when there is a conflict between what the perceptual representation \"says\" about the stimulus, and the way the stimulus really is. If imagining does not involve an external stimulus, in what sense can we be said to imagine illusions? Where is the needed conflict between representation and reality? Note that this is a fair question even to the defender of MRI. Suppose someone imagines \"as present\" a set of lines that look just like the Müller-Lyer lines. Who's to say he isn't imagining two lines that really are of different lengths? The short answer is that these studies all partly involve perception of a physical stimulus and that this provides the needed contrast. In all such studies of which I am aware, subjects are first shown a physical stimulus and are then asked to imagine something in addition to that stimulus-essentially \"adding on\" to it in some way. For instance, Bernbaum and Chung (1981) showed subjects a straight line and asked them to alternately imagine outward facing or inward facing arrows at its ends (this was called \"imagining the Müller-Lyer illusion\").22 Imagining the different ways of adding arrows resulted in different judgments about the length of the line, just as seeing arrows at the ends of each line typically leads to different judgments about their relative lengths. But here the \"illusory\" contrast is between the various ways the line is perceived to be and the line itself. And, of course, we already accepted that perceptual representations can conflict with one's beliefs-the question is whether imaginative ones can. Such examples involve no contrast between the contribution of imagination itself (e.g., the imagined arrow-ends) and belief. And so they offer no reason to conclude that visual imagination as such is encapsulated from belief. What the experiments do provide evidence for is that there are distinctively visual ways of reasoning, and that under specific circumstances these ways of reasoning can lead us astray about how things actually are (in some cases, this is all the studies' authors are trying to show). If we are using a ruler to determine the length of a line, adding arrows at its ends obviously will not affect our judgment of its length; but if we are trying to judge the length just by looking, characteristics of the visual system make it such that adding arrows of different kinds at the ends can \"throw off\" the judgment. Because certain 22 Pressey and Wilson (1974) ran a similar experiment featuring the Poggendorff illusion; Wallace's (1984) analogous study featured the Ponzo illusion. 32 representational characteristics of visual perception are mirrored by visualization, our vision-based judgments can be thrown off by visualizing additions to figures in the same way they would be thrown off if we saw the figures with those additions in place. But this does not show that visual imagination is encapsulated from belief-only that there are distinctively visual methods of problem-solving. It is well-known that humans use a wide variety of inference rules and heuristics in practical reasoning (Girgerenzer, Todd, & Group, 1999). It is not as though all (or even very much of) human reasoning proceeds via the inference rules of formal logic (JohnsonLaird & Byrne, 2002). Much everyday inference is inductive or probabilistic in nature. Consider, for example, the processes through which one chooses between competing explanations that are logically compatible with one's evidence. Moreover, it is well known that many of the heuristics actually deployed by humans often lead to reasoning errors, and that different heuristics can return contradictory results (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977). For instance, in work on preference reversals, whether a subject deems one option better than another often changes depending on how the options are described, even when the different descriptions don't entail real differences in the options described (Tversky & Thaler, 1990). In such cases one arguably uses different heuristics to reason about the cases, depending on how they are described. Such heuristics return contradictory results, even though the outcomes being reasoned about remain the same. Similar results have been found concerning the calculation of comparative probabilities. A famous example comes from Tversky & Kahneman (1983), where subjects were given a description of a woman \"Linda\" who is \"outspoken\" and \"concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice.\" Asked whether it was more likely that Linda was a feminist bank teller, versus merely a bank teller, subjects typically replied that the former was more likely, even though a straightforward principle of probabilistic reasoning holds that A&B is never more likely than A by itself. Subsequent research has shown that how the problem is approached-and whether one succumbs to the faulty pattern of reasoning-depends much upon how the question is posed (Girgerenzer, 1991, 1996). The important point here is that humans attack problems in a variety of ways. The fact that these algorithms and heuristics sometimes return differing answers does not entail that they are operating on different kinds of mental states 33 (Samuels, 1998). So, the fact that visual reasoning sometimes generates different judgments than non-visual reasoning does not by itself show that the mental states involved in visualization are not themselves beliefs (or components of beliefs). Of course, it does not show that visualizations are beliefs-only that we don't yet have a clear reason for thinking they are not. But do these considerations threaten the distinction between perception and belief as well? Is perception not just one more reasoning heuristic? The key difference perception retains with both belief and visualization is its stimulus dependence. All things equal, the only way to change a visual perceptual representation of two lines, so that one is represented as longer than the other, is to change the lines themselves. By contrast, we can through an act of will reason about whatever length lines we wish; commitments featured in chains of reasoning are (crucially) not stimulus dependent. Visualizations have the key characteristic of stimulus independence in spades, notwithstanding the phenomenon of \"imagining illusions.\" This renders it more suitable to be seen as a kind of reasoning process than as a quasi-perceptual one. Of course, while stimulus independence guarantees a measure of flexibility and \"freedom\" uncharacteristic of perceptual representations, it does not guarantee independence from broadly rational constraints. But that just restates one of our main theses: the freedom of imagination is a freedom to reason about topics of one's own choice, not a freedom to reason (or perceive) however one wishes. By contrast, perceptual representations are not suitable to be governed by rational constraints of any kind, precisely because their stimulusdependence places them outside of one's cognitive control. If BV is not obviously false, should we prefer it to IG? I think so, if only tentatively. BV has simplicity on its side; there is no interaction between belief and a different kind of mental representation that needs to be explained; visualizing just is a way of updating (or rendering occurrent) one's beliefs about how certain scenarios would unfold. IG is oddly redundant in this regard; it holds that in visualizing we generate a representation of how a certain kind of scenario unfolds, just so that it may then cause a belief with the same (or nearly the same) content. As remarked above, one might advocate IG on the grounds that visualizations (or parts of visualizations) fail tests of compositionality and systematicity, supposing we had good grounds for thinking that they do. But this would 34 simply amount to marking with terminology the problem of how reasoning processes without the relevant compositional structure interact with those that have it. While this is an important and difficult question, there seems little reason to mark it by using 'belief' for one kind of commitment and something else for the other. In sum, once we have concluded that visualization is a useful, stimulus independent, and not inherently misrepresentational means of generating (or reactivating) commitments, it is it is hard to see why IG should be preferred to BV. A more definitive conclusion, however, would require defending a more precise set of principles for individuating mental states, and a deeper investigation into the metaphysics of belief than I have had space for here. What I hope to have established is that the matter of whether visualization is a kind of belief hangs on very different kinds of questions-and far more subtle ones-than most have usually thought. If BV is false, it is not obviously false. Should it turn out to be false nonetheless, IG is a worthy alternative. 6. Conclusion I have proposed a new place for visualization within a broader cognitive architecture. The freedom of visual imagination is not a freedom to misrepresent the world; it is not a freedom to entertain representations we believe to be false. Rather, it is a freedom to engage in visuospatial reasoning about (sometimes fantastical) topics of our own choosing. Understanding imagination's freedom in this way allows us to simultaneously explain its usefulness to practical reasoning. Once we understand diachronic patters of visualization as constituting visuospatial commitments, the question arises as to the relation between these commitments and one's beliefs. I have argued that we should broaden somewhat the traditional conception of belief, to allow in visualizations in as a particular species. Despite their sensory character, visual imaginings are not informationally encapsulated from belief in the way of visual perceptual representations. And while assimilating visualizations to belief leaves open the question of how \"imagistic\" representations inferentially interact with purely \"propositional\" ones, this question needs answering even if we do not assimilate visualization to belief. Allowing the assimilation assures that we see past the dogma that 35 visualizing involves misrepresenting the world before us, while encouraging an appreciation of its proper place among our rational faculties.

With my time on the qualitative studies, I came across the nocebo effect illustrated with the fear of MERs-CoV in Korea. The effect looks into the negative dimension of human mind and his personality, which could aggravate the current challenge of national crisis, June, 2015. Paradoxically, the nocebo effect can be said to characterize the qualitative context of inquiry. As Freud suggested, the vast of human element is of unexplainable dimension that is less easily quantifiable or generizable over the population (Broome, 2010). This does not say that the continental researchers had been affected with a late nationalization or late development of region leaving them to search for an ego.

Chapter I. Research and the Two Methods A. Comparing the Quantitative and Qualitative (a) A Scratch on the Science Community and Research Method One can ponder on the act or attitude, \"why we research?\" There would be a plenty of response. Somebody may say the organization he manages recently received a funded project on the poll of coming election to the profits of his survey firm. Others would admit, \"He now prepares his credentials of tenure review in which the research performance and scholarly activities are crucial component for final decision.\" Some others would introduce his clinic for consulting and program evaluation dealing with a particular conditions or specific purpose of in-depth situation. The graduate students should do it to complete his degree requirement. On the common attribute of whole of these cases, we see that they treat them a body in pursuit of some dimension on intelligent curiosity. They are driven to strike that agonistic into the kind of rational order. The subjective and objective conundrum involving the quantitative and qualitative studies partly relates with this backdrop (Patton, 2002). The body, mind, and spirit-such trilemma in the view of classic philosopher-also has pertinence in terms of understanding the methodological debate. It is, for this reason, a threshold question to ask, \"What do we like to know if we begin our research?\" It is also in this context that the researcher himself is most determinative as someone like a seaman on the steering key of how to design a research plan and what method he chooses. As Patton guides, the status of researchers is one factor to choose among the traditional triad -quantitative, qualitative, mixed-that the graduate students need to consider the supervisors of competence and auspice in progressing his dissertation work (2002). Nevertheless, the nature of inquiry and attribute of topic -most importantly the \"curiosity of researcher to know what\"-would preferably govern a selection from methods. In the cross-section of different methods, there are a scope of points or views already debated on the trait, strengths and weakness. Even a contention is well noted in which each side could be skeptical of other way of knowledge in terms of the scientific force to vindicate on phenomenon or occurrence. I have some thought rather intuitively. As we see in the science citation index, most researchers work on natural or engineering science. The medical science had flourished and perhaps continues or will continue to prosper, which perhaps could be captured under the umbrella term of natural science. The two most leading journal titles, \"Nature\" and \"Science,\" are not irrelevant with this present status. The methods on social science, neighborly with the humanity, would actually be less sizable or organized-at least pluralistic in conception of researchers-enabling to stand on different approach to resolve the curiosity and to expel the thirst of our sensory agnosticism (Hunt & Colander, 2015). The reality of UFO is some of most popular thirst whether it actually exists or the aliens of other universe would live like us. We never undertake – or at least dislike -the survey method in resolving such thirst which is perhaps because the survey method is received so as not to completely solve the question. This example thrusts several implications (i) the natural science or its method would be most accurate and convincing as we often agree (ii) the quantitative method is related with political or social context of knowledge which we could share with possible imperfection (iii) there are a wider scope of knowledge province actually blurring the traditional notion of method proponents. (b) An Excuse for Qualitative Studies While we acknowledge the principal service of research is to compile the data basis and scientific knowledge, the evidence often is alleged a key strand to support the research work which point has been intensely argued by the quantitative circle (Laureate Education, 2010e). It is seemingly undeniable that the qualitative truths are some taste of literature or novel-like understanding of exterior world, which, however, differs from its systemic analysis of interview result and the kind of coding system with the aids of computerized program. Given the literature can possibly satisfy the curiosity of, and thirst for the deep humanity, it could stand alone on the utility as university department, but would be made a borderline case with the social science because of evidence. We normally would not expect an evidence for the novel writers. With a similar thought of dealings, the history and literature researchers would often be more descriptive and autocratic than evidence-reliant or without the quantitative information-but comparative in cases-except for the sensitive issue of controversies. The setting of literature or novel writers would provide a useful comparison that brings our think-point around the strands of research method, such as fact, belief and knowledge. The literature and novel often would not be a fact -of course with exceptionsthat lacks the quality as science or social science (Gardner, Lawn, Ridi, Schakel, 2012). It also can be seen as separated from the normal understanding of knowledge if it is not factbased . Generally we could not draw upon that source to form our belief system although we may get hallucinated with a fantastic love scene of Gone with the Wind or ego forming of juveniles with the mighty Robocop in the cinema. Nevertheless, the human agent affected from the literature and cinema personally will experience or share the same intelligent process with the reality-in some deep dimension of his ego. It could be a fact, belief and knowledge-of course in his subjective dimension-to be utilized to determine his personality lifetime. As one fusion of our notions, we may illustrate the case of \"science fiction\" which is a popular source of Hollywood cinema. It combines the scientific backdrop with our imaginary story which shows the current intellectual taste of people. Around these examples, perhaps extreme as bootstrapped with the methodology of social science (Hunt & Colander, 2015), we can imply a relativity and balance apart from any absolutism on methodological query (i) the scientific truths are constructive in concept and explains a part of human dimension besides the society-most immediate object to be investigated (ii) both methods probably are not definite, but instrumental to provide a professional platform for the social scientists. Given the imperfection around statistical assumption or bias of in-depth inquiry, we consider it nearest to the truth earned from the natural science, and we would be dormant to stress the use of natural knowledge for the better picture of scientific living. Nevertheless, it is surprising that EU and US, most advanced countries of science, do not agree on the impact of hormone-growing cows and meat on human body. It is one of medical issue, but had been disputed in the shoes of WTO laws-perhaps pivotally related with the evaluation of desired human condition-the kind of social standard and professional belief. In Wyeth v. Levine, the use and labeling of gangrene injected with Phenergan, an anti-nausea drug made by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, were debated that the social standard to provide a warning would differ varying with the locale and people-even the pharmacy or medical experts themselves for the extent of public interchange. This illustrates that even the absolute truths of natural science would turn to become relative in the force of persuasion given its application into the social and human dimension. The scientific truths have a meaning only when we can be constructive with the compromise and common assumption. It is a part of human dimension as we see them left with other working professionals or researchers, who make the people knowledgeable or create a belief system as in the case of literature or history students and judicial bench tasked with the comparative examination of documents and prior cases in relevance (Laureate Education, 2010e). I am not sure, nevertheless, if the history and judicial science can have a class as qualitative studies whatsoever. In this stream of understanding, we may also illustrate the psycho-therapy or analysis as a broach within the qualitative method. After all, however, we would be unwise if to miss emphasizing the thought process and general attitude embedded within the traditional two methods on social science. The attitudes \"symbolize the community of social science as us\" and allow the platform as a social scientist in the society. It needs no further mention that the training on this method is any more important for the research students and interested professionals. (c) A Comparative Thought on Two Methods One stigmatic focus on the methodological reflection can come contrasted between the number and story as Patton guides (2012). He also illustrated historic figures often held greatest in the world history, in which Marx on English factory, Darwin on Galapagos tortoise, Jung on dream and so, would be composed into the understanding of humanity and society (2012). The number is generally conceived as most accurate and certain that we even need not cite the greatness of Pythagoras. This probably would be a most element that the quantitative researchers could convince himself his intelligent process to prove his research question (Creswell, 2009). On the while, the qualitative researchers would focus directly on the human agent to unearth truths (2009). This leads to a comparative difference on the aura and propensity of research work. First, the quantitative studies stretched outwardly -hence more societal -while the qualitative studies tend to project into the human agent, what is a determined component of society and end meaning of social science research. Second, the scope of research coverage possibly could have a different characteristic between the average and selected class. Third, as aforementioned, the quantitative investigation could bring a consequence that it would be more easily adaptive with the political and social context of research issue. This does not necessarily mean that the wider exposure always is guaranteed of quantitative studies because, for example, the media may intervene for the issue of African poverty or Sepp Blatter with the bribed FTO leaders in 2015-a good source of qualitative research-more in focus leading to public awareness. Any popular research findings would not only stem from the quantitative investigation, but from the qualitative inquiry. Fourth, the strengths of each method depends on the nature of topics and research design-hence, case by case basis to select for most effective research outcome. For example, the deep investigation of Supreme Court justices on his or her propensity could be more properly framed with a qualitative approach utilizing in-depth interviews and documentary examination with his timeline of significant decisions. The behavior and living mode of \"aboriginal tribes\" could be delved more convincingly in ground theory and long observations than scaled survey inquiry since they would often not be susceptible of usual generalization from \"original countries,\" what we say of Europeans (Creswell, 2013). Fifth, the difference in major tone of each method would explain its use that the quantitative studies would serve the test of existing theory while the qualitative researchers employ the method to develop into a theory building as we read in the article on negative leadership. Sixth, both methods can share an eventual destination as we often encounter in the abstract of journal articles and key terms. The qualitative researchers seem to have a more trait in affinity with this style of presentation-i.e., abstract and key terms, since he primarily works on his key thesis and with a long indulgence or observation as illustrated in Patton's historic scientists. In this phase, we may note the importance of lead author on the articles and linguistic differences in terms of the implications of scientific study. In this dimension, the qualitative methods could be convoluted more than quantitative one, but also could be a solution for any meaningful deals with the difficult process of coding or word magic in the research operation. As the terms of art are uttered to ascribe the work of Supreme Court justices, the qualitative researchers would be stuck on the key words and seek to supplement for the abnegation or reluctance in the interview process. (d) A Focus on Qualitative Inquiry from Patton Given the distinction between two major traditions, the qualitative studies would be exposed to several tips for effective research operation (Patton, 2002). First, the qualitative researchers have to be more minded and focused, \"how illuminate the meanings.\" Second they need to study how things work as we see the evaluation of program. Michael Scriven gave an insight, \"evaluation is the process of determining the merit, worth and value of things, and evaluation are the products of that process.\" Third, capturing stories to understand people's perspective and experiences has to constantly be minded which characterizes the qualitative studies qualitative. As Patterson cited from Rukeyser and Gottschall, the ending point would be a universe and human beyond the politics, \"the universe is made of stories, not atoms,\" and \"stories make us human (p.7, 2002).\" Of course, this is not to say the qualitative studies are totally irrelevant with the politics and social activism. Fourth, it is no fullest merely to take a part of system, but the qualitative studies are required to elucidate how systems function and their consequences for people's lives. Fifth, the context has a central importance than numerical order that the qualitative researchers investigate how and why it matters. Sixth, as the kind of toppling, the qualitative researchers take an extra process or final touch so as to identify the unanticipated consequences (2002). This is the point that we admit an imperfection of social science research and honestly open the question for the future consideration. The attitude of federal government in their work process also underlies same element, for example, \"niggardly but expansive on regulating the FCC authority by Congress\" or waits to see on \"deference rule\" for the net neutrality policy by Supreme Court in the NCTA decision (National Cable & Telecommunications Association et al. v. Brand X Internet Services et al., 2005). This attitude is progressive and incremental on the kind Darwinian beliefs. Seventh, the qualitative researchers make a case comparison to discover important patterns and themes, which emanates a same feel in terms of judicial analysis of precedents in the creation of judge-made law. B. The Qualitative Studies: Characteristics and Service with an Example (a) General The characteristic of qualitative studies can be surveyed in five points of consideration including the (i) general framework (ii) analytical objectives (iii) question format (iii) data format (iv)flexibility in study design. The qualitative researchers seek to explore phenomena whose instruments use more flexible and iterative style of eliciting and categorizing responses to questions. The phenomena closely related with human agent, and constructed with the story and context necessitates the semi-structured methods such as indepth interviews, focus groups, and participant observation (Patton, 2002). The method is principally descriptive of variation, relationships, individual experience and group norms while the quantitative studies quantify variation, predict causal relationship and describe the characteristics of a population. The question format is open-ended while the quantitative studies are closed-ended. The data format is textual obtained from audiotapes, videotapes, and field notes while the quantitative studies are numerical obtained by assigning numerical values to responses. The flexibility in study design is notable to make two methods distinct that (i) the qualitative studies would often practice the addition, exclusion or wording of particular interview questions, (ii) participants responses actually affects the story and context, (iii) study design is iterative meaning an adjustment of data collection and research questions to what is learned (Creswell, 2009). Figure: Strengths and Weaknesses Strengths Weaknesses Strong to describe a phenomena Weak to confirm or test the hypotheses or theory Strong to describe the whole of picture, but often narrowed to the specific research population, usually called upon focus group, ethnography or aboriginal culture, historiography and so. Weak to predict the causal relationships or to describe the characteristics of population with the aid of statistics Strong to be flexible with the study design Weak to be less stable unlike the quantitative studies Strong to unearth an in-depth knowledge Weak to be comparably less certain and less objective -at least in sensibility-than numerical presentation of evidence Strong to exclude the bias of researchers in the stage of research design by iteration and adjustment Weak to cost much time and devotion, it being worse from the unexpected scale of new learning during the process (b)One article on the Qualitative Studies The article for the discussion purpose is named \"From Ineffectiveness to Destruction: A Qualitative Study on the Meaning of Negative Leadership (2009).\" It was authored by J. Schilling, RWTH Aachen University, Germany, and featured in the journal titled Leadership. It is 27 pages long article employing the qualitative method, in which 42 managers were investigated with in-depth interview. The article aims at analyzing the content and structure of manager's conceptions of negative leadership. The leadership studies most often had studied the trait of leaders, quality of leadership style, and romantic relationship between the leaders and followers. However, the negative studies on the leadership would not be totally absent that we see a bundle of empirical studies on this concern. The positive image of leadership, as the author said, could be \"larger than life conception of leadership,\" and can bias the crucial feature of problematic leaders (2009). One characteristic, here, could we find that the qualitative inquiry is most adequate and suitable to the purpose of research. To see, the theme is negative that often could not be explored with a normal condition of survey setting or impression. In that case, the survey result could well tend to yield on a positive hypocrisy of respondents, who would be tedious or discouraged to express his actual disposition, knowledge and sensibility. The research of negative leadership would be framed to deal with the ineffective and even destructive leadership, which is the worst case that the leaders do not contribute to the success of organization or may practice a destructive behavior for the deviant and counterproductive workplace. This negative attribute of research theme would be more adequate if to involve a thick and deep personality of samples. Otherwise the \"larger than life\" would mislead to fail the purpose of researcher as the author presaged in the first part of this article (2009). Second, the researcher's two research questions asked, \"what aspects form the basis for the evaluation of leadership or when do we speak of negative leadership?\" These questions are what and how question often entertained in the qualitative study and theorybuilding plan of researcher on the theme. The research questions had been detailed with several concrete questions in response with his two purposes, to see, investigating the content and meaning of negative leadership and analyzing the structure of negative leadership behaviors (2009). The how question also can be a popular form of inquiries while the why question would be prime relating with the quantitative studies (Creswell, 2009). For the first point, the researchers would inquire (i) what are the most typical aspects of negative leadership in the view of practitioners (ii) how do people causally attribute negative leadership (iii) which are the most important effects of negative leadership? For the second point, J. Schilling framed to ask, (i) how are the different behaviors related to each other (ii) are there underlying topics that characterize the views of negative leadership? The context and story can be analyzed and narrated with the coding analysis and in-depth inquiry by asking how question and what or which question (Creswell, 2013). It certainly fortifies the intent of authors, who pursued a theory building as we see his last question. In other words, the topic itself had been open and remained to be filled upon the empirical process of analysis. The strengths and weaknesses can be viewed to corroborate with the characteristic of each method between the two. In grand view, both methods can be compared analogically with the two disciplines of economics covering the micro and macro theories. The micro economics would be more dehumanized in operation with the assumption of abstract and rational player of individual, but could be strong notwithstanding the human particularities. This would make it \"original than aboriginal\" if on the western standard, the kind of progenies from Cartesian tenet and table rasa as limited with pure reason (Chomsky, 2009). The macro economics would be of applied knowledge that might be practical and readily adaptive with the external world. The how and what question may be patronized by macro economics and massively related with the particularities of actors and countries. The actors in this case are realistic and have a story and context (Welch & Welch, 2012). For example, the demand and supply rule can well be mechanized with generalizability and commonness assumption of actors and system. The concept of GDP and theme of underdeveloped countries would be specific and readily practicable to respond with the needs of national economic policy. We can turn to be interested in the rising economy of China by asking what characterizes the Chinese economy or how they so fast emerge as a world major economic power rather than asking why the market in perfectness assumption reach the optimal point among the price, demand and supply. It needs to be visited that the \"bounded rationality\" would be cognized to explain the limitations of economic studies. The context and history on macro economics can be biased with many intervening elements, for example, differing view on the status of China concerning its economic hegemony. The assumption of \"competitive advantage\" to explain the micro basis of international trade would flaw with omission of other factors, for example, transportation cost and culture, or international politics (2012). If Marx theory is viewed as one of micro economics than macro economics-for example, assumed with the abstract nature of prurient interest-driven human subject on pure reason, but also powerful with alleged reality-the bounded rationality is perceptively useful to consider new wave of social activism, such as environmentalism, beneficent capitalism, feminism and core periphery theory, and so (Hunt, Colander, 2015). Interestingly, the truism or science absolutism often is corrective with the interdisciplinary instillation of ideas. K.W., Choi, an economist and now in acting prime minister of South Korea commented in the policy forum dealing with the issue of currency unit reform, stating \"the economic policy is related with the extent of psychological impact on the economic actors.\" The statement seems echoing if the FRB is critiqued as ineffective with new policy measures. While many assumptions and general knowledge had already been infused with human agent, it is not deniable that the bounded rationality is not only pertinent to economics, but also to many theorists, even in terms of methodology itself. Third, the author also introduced by stating that the purpose of the current research is to perform an open, inductively-oriented investigation (Schilling, 2009). This purpose typically is served by the qualitative studies while the quantitative investigation is scaled and closed system of inquiry and designed to test the existing theory, and often aims with the why question. The quantitative researchers may exhilarate themselves by finding the reason or contrary evidence between his samples and theoretical complacency. For example, the general awareness of MERS-CoV from the prevailing empirical findings shows that it only could be infected by coughing, spitting or other ways of similar personal contact. It cannot transmit in the air as to infect within the open community space. One study had reported that the virus can be present in the air, whose researchers would perhaps be most excited for this rare findings and his pleasure of brevity with no further work on theory building. The scene of qualitative researchers would be more obstinate and hard with the innate nature of questions, such as what and when in this case, and complexions of theory building. Fourth, the researcher had been concerned of behaviors, antecedents and consequences of negative leadership, which triggers the context and story of negative leadership (2009). This is considered one important characteristic and strength of qualitative research as Patton guides. The literature review in this article has been undertaken apparently not in the end to generate hypotheses and assumptions, but in the purpose to set out to explore the meaning of negative leadership and the contextual understanding for the theory building purpose by dealing with its antecedents and consequences. He entertained the key theme of previous work in several categories, which reminds if the characteristic of qualitative studies can eventually crystallize with a key theme, such as Mark with English factory and Jung with Dream as Patton guides (2002). Ashforth and similar line of research works in the author's purview had described and pursued to empirically convince their proposition and theory, which covers, as we see, petty tyrants, abusive supervision, two dimensional destructive leaderships on concern for people (human-oriented) and concern for task (task-oriented, as well as the shadow side of charisma and pseudo-transformational leadership (Schilling, 2009). The author's space of contribution had been alleged by pointing out the lack or shortage of current studies, but in the metaphor of qualitative nuance, \"a number of open points remain concerning the behaviors, the antecedents, and consequences of negative leadership (2009).\" Fifth, the method of article includes a vast attribute of qualitative studies, which reinforces the strengths of qualitative studies. It used semi-structured interviews containing open-ended questions which have the ability to evoke responses that are (i) meaningful and culturally salient to the participant (ii) unanticipated by the researcher (iii) rich and explanatory in nature. It has strengths to produce the findings that were not determined in advance although the quantitative studies seeks to confirm hypotheses about phenomena (Creswell, 2009). The interview preparation in the article always included a main and alternative questions, which is popular and effective to seek the deep and behind stories. This is the point of strengths within the qualitative investigation that could not be feasible with the scaled closed questions. Sixth, as we note, the author had drawn \"purposeful samples\" that participants of the study were 42 middle and top managers (38 men, 4 women) of two divisions of a large scale German telecommunication company (Schilling, 2009). This sampling practice is typical to characterize the qualitative design of investigation as Patton guides, \"Cases for study- people, organizations, communities, cultures, events, critical incidencies-are selected because they are information rich and illuminative, that is, they offer useful manifestations of the phenomenon of interest (2002).\" For this attribute, it has strength to infer an insight than empirical generalization, and the basis practically useful to aim at theory building than test or allegation to explain the investigated population. As the author purported to investigate a negative leadership, the status of firms may be more adequate if the company had undergone major changes in its structure and culture as it developed form a state owned enterprise towards a privately owned profit organization. The frigid atmosphere of company under the pressure of privatization could foster a disclosure of deep humanity and \"personal experience and engagement\" within the Patton's frame of purview on qualitative design-also reminded of characteristics on (i) emergent design flexibility (ii) emphatic neutrality and mindfulness (iii) dynamic systems (2002). Seventh, the content analysis procedures in the article used a combined approach exploiting two qualitative progenies, say, ground theory approach and traditional content analysis. Given the ground theory is extreme, the content analysis are complementary with the quantitative studies that need not necessarily be \"flexible, idiosyncratic, fluid and nonsequential\" in collecting and analyzing data. The process of qualitative content analysis has clearly been suggested through seven paragraphs on page 108. The qualitative design often relies on inductive approach as the author also employed by starting with a preliminary system of categories. Eighth, the \"concept map\" is one vantage tool to progress on the qualitative research as the author fully utilized to deal with his research plan and purpose (Creswell, 2013). This quality of qualitative reasoning, of course, has strength to reveal the whole picture of context and history than merely proving or disproving with the generalization to the whole populace. The author, in this case, intended to deal with the behaviors, antecedents, and consequences of worse leadership. The purpose is not to test if German managers practice a negative leadership or its implications relating with the existing theory on the leadership of German managers or hypotheses allegedly most curious in terms of his or her professional expertise. The characteristic of qualitative research is thick-flavor to govern this article and well designed to serve the purpose of researcher. Given the complementary nature of content analysis, descriptive numerical analysis was used as the author introduced on a page (2013). Ninth, the antecedents for the negative leadership had been discussed, and the author presented that the majority of statements referred to the environment of the leader among the three factors of antecedents, to see, person, interaction and environment. This presentation corroborates the characteristic of qualitative inquiry that study design is iterative meaning an adjustment of data collection and research questions to what is learned (Laureate Education, Inc., 2010e). 71.1 percents of outcome might alter an initial embracement of researcher on the antecedents if he would expect the person of leadership would be prevailing. Then he is reoriented to make adjustment to structure his findings in any realistic frame. This point also shows a dynamic picture of research operation that would normally not occur in the quantitative investigation. Tenth, the qualitative design has a characteristic to begin with a naturalistic inquiry and context-sensitive, which method hinges on the linguistic element and delicacies of analysis. For example, the use of word, \"vindictive\" or \"acting perfidiously\" would key to reveal the negative leadership that must be carefully prepared with a reasonable coverage of raw data (Schilling, 2009). The raw data needs to be revisited so as to be iterative with adjustment and the author simply stated, \"Also, an inspection of topic and person frequencies does not reveal outstanding dissimilarities concerning the importance and pervasiveness of a main or subcategory.\" Eleventh, the following sections of article also is illustrative with the characteristic of qualitative studies, in which the structure in the meaning of negative leadership was inferred from his empirical findings, but \"intensely engaged with a tough interaction of investigators and samples than simple closed survey.\" As the qualitative studies often lead to insight, the author mentioned, \"As prior studies have not been able to explain the occurrence of abusive supervision or tyrannical leadership to a satisfactory degree, the present results might prove an interesting alley for future research (2009).\" It is also a usual tone of qualitative repercussion that the author suggests in the Limitations and Future Research, \"...may be that salience and pervasiveness of the categories would be different in other contexts\" or \"the national culture should therefore be an important variable with regard to the development, forms and consequences of negative leadership (2009).\" This is implied to evince that the qualitative design would be strong for its depth of knowledge, but could be weak so as to be less general to cover the population as a whole. (c) Reflections Once I had explored the research issue of North and South unification with a focus on the legal integration for uniform constitution and various statutes. It pushed me to deal with a big question, and looked like a semi-textbook with an inchoate idea and baby theory upon the completion of research project. The literature review thankfully had allowed the space of creativity and originality of my work product, and can also be a typical way of foreign graduate legal researchers in the process of his dissertation work. They would be beneficial with new statutes and codes, for example, from the Korean Congress, that are enacted recently, which would be their research topic certainly original and contributive. This could be viewed as one of qualitative enclaves enmeshed into a larger scope of qualitative inquiry. This interplay is fairly consequential in excavating a new knowledge and research findings. It could be aboriginal -one trait word to characterize the qualitative studies-from the viewpoint of host country, but became original as a crop to expand the horizon of new knowledge. I have once argued that the quantitative studies are on generality of subjects and commonness for involved strands. This profile would vary that the qualitative studies tend to be strong with the story and enclaves. The e-age and rapid compression of space with the development of telecommunication technology also factor to change a paradigm of knowledge and research activities (Ronald, 2014). At least, the contemporary society certainly would be more specific as if we can trace a person with the satellite spotting and the electronic identifier on the leg of sex criminals in Korea guarantees to be safeguarded from his potential danger. That may be favorable concerning the elements and environments of qualitative studies. For example, we may follow up by comparing the research work of Korean statute with the e-government of Korea displaying the statute. We can entertain many on-line sources of information and stories with the dissertations of aboriginal culture. With my time on the qualitative studies, I came across the nocebo effect illustrated with the fear of MERs-CoV in Korea. The effect looks into the negative dimension of human mind and his personality, which could aggravate the current challenge of national crisis, June, 2015. Paradoxically, the nocebo effect can be said to characterize the qualitative context of inquiry. As Freud suggested, the vast of human element is of unexplainable dimension that is less easily quantifiable or generizable over the population (Broome, 2010). This does not say that the continental researchers had been affected with a late nationalization or late development of region leaving them to search for an ego. This is to say that the qualitative studies could explain the part of truths for the universe and human. The researchers interested in deep knowledge could employ their method, but in ethics, who would not vulture the objects of his theme and conducts on due scientific ground.

The Tentative Title of Thesis-College Professors with Two Shelters of Distance within the Local Universities in Korea: Their Identity and Lives as an Expert Professional and Educator. (a) The Research Problem The space of college and university is a distinct arena of public interaction where the students and instructors have a discourse and exchange of their views and ideas, who grow and learn. The students would acquire the knowledge of his disciplines and prepare to form a basis for the employment as well as humanity or social views on life-time impact. The professors would earn an income to subsidize their living as well as perform his professional ambition on instruction and research (Patton, 2002). The professors generally are churned on their specific locality, who has a personal basis on that specific locality, such as residence or educational background. Often the professors are expected of their unitary coherence by the campus community over every aspect of his personhood and loyalty. Nevertheless, it is actually undeniable that some of professors are discrete and should be active between his professional duty and personal mode of being (Laureate Education, 2010e). They have to commute two or three hours weekly exploiting a short stay in time for the consortium and pleasure with their family members. Alpha University (pseudonym) is located in Kwangu-ju, a southern part of South Korea, which comes to reach by three hours driving from Seoul, a capital city of Korea. There are many other local universities at the similar distance from Seoul, and the college professors of these local universities would be considerable at number, who have to commute weekly from his Seoul homes. In this guess, they are not only discrete, but also would be a fair component of college education in Korea. As the college education is an important process of national administration or public education, their identity and mode of lives would not only interest us, but also should be a useful touchstone to form any public policy of college education (Tierney, 1988; Tierney, 1994). (b) Purpose Statement The research comes into interest that was provoked with a general apprehension and expectation of people about an abstract imagery of research and class performance (Hess, 2002). The college professors are generalized with the specific expertise and professional background, and their social lives as well as elements of personal living had not been closely investigated (Tierney, 1988; Tierney, 1994). More interestingly, their specific backdrop or living mode would not be merely a social matter, but could be related with the educational effect and his or her professional growth in his field of expertise. The research in this area seems quite understudied for possibly many reasons. For example, the college professors are generally considered to be autonomous with authority and leadership than merely a part of component or passive research subject. They are expected to be fullest with their responsibility and perfection, who are professionally standardized from his intrinsic of role activity. They are, for example, a living international trade law, which could be said of professors on the international trade law. They are economist or chemist and math expert who share a common quality to the national and international standard. Their personal chores or individual trait is not a concern of common people or student, and even the university or governmental administration of education. They are same with the high school teachers in terms of their role to breed the school students, but can be distinguished for their ultimatum of his field of expertise, which may cause them to be excluded as a passive research subject. Second, they would like to avoid telling their personal story and feel of identity during his professional lives because of their general pride and adherence with a social esteem. We may have a distinct group of politically oriented professors, what is called polifessor in Korea, who may be sanguine if we would investigate them. This context would not be plausible to relate with the professors of local university for my story. Third, the investigation would not bring a pleasure, but could mainly disclose the negative side of his living mode that may be questioned of his loyalty or faith with the professional ethics. This aspect of research coverage could be similar with the new officers of Korean government who should commute weekly to report for their office, in which this point can also be seen a factor of understudies on that group. Fourth, they may not be interested in this kind of research to spoil a vast time as a participant and eventually could hinder on their time and energy devotion to research and preparation of lecture. Nevertheless, I have developed an interest and the meaning or narrative of their stories who would be a nomad professor possibly for more success and professional accomplishment as we sense-might be scientifically evidenced –with the Jewish people. In terms of research method, the terms or words are placed on central focus in terms of qualitative methodology, which could be flexible onto the progress of research operation. The word, nomad, may have an earlier origin within the European ancestors (Phillips, 1965). Now it may be used to describe the massive users of webpage for interactivity within the campus or captures a tenured faculty who devote their labor as an adjunct professor (Hess, 2002; Norton, 2001). The exact meaning of word depends on the use of authors, who would intend to semantically denote its concept. For example, the author may define \"I will take it as a prototype of men or women of ideas.\" A scholarly dealings on the word also sparsely be present to discuss the network analysis and ethnographic problems of regional clan and could be used to describe the nomad citizenship in terms of free market and labor issue (Douglas, Johansen, 2006; Holland, 2011). This simply shows that the term is not much used, while it very precisely can define the scope of local professors in my case. The dealings besides the definitional issue of nomad, apparently are also limited concerning the inquiries of faculty and professionals, notwithstanding it being national or international at scale. The investigation on their identity and living mode would increase the awareness of public, professors, and administrators on the nomad professors, and may expand into other nomad professionals nationally or internationally. For example, the officers of Korean government at the movement of new government complex located in the remote local city may be qualitatively investigated to assist with shaping the strategy of personnel resources. In this case, the theme might be a nomad officer perhaps largely captured under the umbrella term of nomad professional. The investigation may expand into international dimension, i.e., how the demography or geographical specificities of nation would make them differ in size and distribution. We may also expect the future research concerning the motivating factors for increase or decrease of nomad professor or comparative studies between the national nomads and shape of international mobility. Most importantly, their identity and living mode would have an extent of educational effect and professional performance, which is a secondary concern of this research plan (Corcoran & Clark, 1984). (c) Research Questions According to Creswell on the qualitative research plan, the research questions normally are prepared with one or two central questions and five or six sub-questions (Creswell, 2009). The central question to deal with my purpose of research is \"Who are the nomad professors?\" and \"How do they deal with their responsibilities and manage a personhood or social existence?\" Both questions had been designed to illuminate their identity and living mode encompassing their personal, social and professional context of behaviors or performance of responsibilities. These two central questions would be divided into several sub-questions dealing with the components of central question. The structure of questions can be presented as follows; (A) Who are the nomad professors? 1. What characterizes the nomad professors? 2. How do we properly make them distinct from their peers with one settled residence? 3. How do we differentiate other professionals of similar identity or living mode? (B) How do they deal with their responsibilities and manage a personhood or social existence? 1. How do they manage their personhood or social existence? 2. How do they perceive or consider them with their counterparts or other professionals in the context of teaching performance? 3. How do they perceive or consider them with their counterparts or other professionals in the context of research performance? 4. How do they perceive or consider them with the counterparts or other professionals in the context of university administration? 5. How do they perceive or consider them with the counterparts or other professionals in the context of his overall professional lives? (d) Some Defense Statement on the Qualitative Research Plan As Creswell guided, introducing and focusing the study is the most important part of research project. Otherwise, the audience or readers of research piece would have difficulties to follow what the researchers intend to do or communicate any meaningful scientific ideas. The clear statement of research problem, purpose, and research questions would allow the readers to be quick to read and become indulgent with the researcher's theme and content (Creswell, 2013) The structure of thesis or research article is an interrelated set of sequential presentation which comes back and forth between the components in scope of certain research questions, data collection, data analysis and interpretation. The leading section with three components may vary depending on the practice and trend ---for example professional article would be implied of purpose statement without express tendering while the dissertation or theses would include all of three -but it is critical to structure and govern the whole of research piece as it helps audience to spearhead on the following underpinnings and details (2013). In this aspect of consideration, I have intended to give three focal terms to clarify the problem and purpose of research, which are (i) the Alpha University in Korea, (ii) nomad professor, as well as (iii) identity and living mode. The second terms are a theme of this research, and Alpha University would clearly delimit the scope of investigation, but hopefully could be applied to other settings, for instance, other local universities in Korea, other professionals, and international context of nomad professionals. The third terms would imply that the theme is most adequately investigated by the qualitative method. Creswell suggested self-reflexive questions to evaluate the beginning part of qualitative research (2013). For example, we can ask \"how can the problem statement be best written to reflect one of the approaches to qualitative question?\" The researchers should not merely plan on tentative research problem, but need to consider a practical aspect of research operation. In that concern, the facile frame simply enmeshed into traditional five approaches would guarantee its feasibility and practicability since those five approaches generally are convinced of success with the long period of professional experiences and convention. The problem statement in my case simply shows that the focus group or ground theory of approach could well base the following research operation with the in-depth interviews or close observations over time period. And the journal writing through the research could be practiced to enrich the stories, which demystifies the focus group and decenters the traditional scope of group awareness. The authentic profile of qualitative research may relate self with the concerned target group of research, so that we may receive \"tell me your story\" as if the qualitative researcher would be a theme itself. This may be most convivially present in the ground theory, and it would be the case of this research plan. Creswell likes to think about the research problem as coming from \"real life\" issues or from a gap in the literature, or both. Personal experience with an issue or a job-related problem would be a popular source for qualitative plan along with the scholarly literature and an advisor's agenda (2013). I had an experience to deal with the theme of Korean Constitutional Court as my advisor had that area of expertise. In this case, personal experience and job-related problem sprang to compose my research plan. The deficiencies of literature could be a useful defense that I have exerted on the present status of research theme above. Barritt also gave an insight that the rationale for the research of social science is not the discovery of new elements, but heightening of awareness for experiences which has been forgotten and overlooked (2013). This aspect is a crucial motivator to structure the research plan. I also hopefully expect that the research is to create dialogue leading to better understanding of the way things appear to someone else and improvements in practice. The vignette on the formula of purpose statement below seems an exemplar as illustrative to clearly convey the intention of qualitative researcher (2013). The purpose of ground theory study in terms of nomad professors of local university in Korea is to understand and describe their identity and living mode in terms of impact on their personhood, social existence and professional accomplishment for the nomad professors at the Chosun University. At this stage of the research, nomad professors will be generally defined as the long distance commuters weekly or in period, who are distinguishable with the professors of general expectation. B. A Journal Writing and Self-Assessment (a) Three Examples on the Days Day 1 Now the term came to an end and summer vacation will start soon. The college students would be busy to prepare for the final exam and the hottest season of 2015 soon will be enjoyed free from academic requirement. Some will be scheduled as a foreign exchange student for short stay in America or Europe. Others will enjoy a river fishing or sea trip for night stay and personal taste of fishing venture. It is not a safe activity that the team of fishing venture may disappear with the overwhelming surge of sea waves as occasionally heralded in the TV news. As a nomad professor, I took a bus to Seoul where my principal residence is located. For the nomad professors at Alpha University, three hours of bus trip for the weekend in Seoul often would be a time of ritual unburdening from his intense professional schedule of lecture and research. As a journal writer, I would suppose that the journal writing had left a tack of shapeless blobs, which would be viscid and thick for the creative eyes. The scholarly look would perhaps be a next issue for the qualitative researchers. While glazing at the outside of bus window, the truth finders could exist in this form of emancipation who would be a post-modern progeny unpalatable with so many hypocrisy versions of theory for the ruling class. I am reminiscent if the works, frame, tenet and theory veiled and armed with the professional mask would be truthful? In this week, I have taught a basic perspective of international laws and intended to provide an insight on the universalism of international law for my students. As the medieval knight would appear with a heavy armament and long spear, the traditional theory of international laws would be such hard that the concept of sovereignty and state as an actor or legal person of the international law would be ironclad in notion. When I introduce the universalism tenet, the students and I feel cathartic as if we find a real truth as teleological of the expected service of international laws. The international law generally is thought to deal with the state actors in its prevailing framework, which the students and I share as somehow hypocrisy taste although it has explained much on the law of international relations. We share that the universalism could be an ultimate destination as Kant envisaged. We also had a time to memoir on the post modern thinkers, for instance, Faucalt, who alleged a new wave of knowledge structure between the ruling version and post-modern reality of individuals. Somebody would argue that the truths are diverse and could have versions to serve the public needs. I may, in some breath, say that it would be less salient who would mind with the vast vulnerable public and individuals. The humanity and social science may have that lens, and the qualitative studies could entertain that tone and repercussion focused on deep humanity and intrinsic of society. I also can relate with the method that may have a nexus for the critical theory, existentialism and post modernism. It is doomed to arrive at 10 o'clock night time, and I found that the tax stop likely welcomed me to home. Day 2 I was asked to convene as a dissertation umpire for one doctoral student of international law. A former dean, Dr. Y. H. Park has an expertise in the field of international law over his thirty years of teaching career here. He is the kind of personality tasted as the Requiem by Mozart, who is settled, calm, and very authentic. He is a long settler at Gwang-ju, and it certainly should be a misnomer if we say him as a nomad professor. He may visit Seoul for business reasons, and actually now is serving for the department of education in Korea. Inside the mind set and personal orientation, however, he is not disposed to have dual homes. He is a principal supervisor of that old student, who now plans to run for the office of congressman at next national election. We have set three times of review occasion, and the structure or content of his dissertation had not been seriously challenged by the four reviewers. Dr. Park, who not only recruited me and also had built a credible local network of scholarship under his supervision, had actually been revered by local elites and professors. The place of dissertation committee was arranged in one local restaurant, which served a cuisine and wine. After one hour talk for the exchange of ideas and potential problem of dissertation draft, we agreed that it is basically acceptable with small modifications. We share that the partial assistance of young professionals in the field may be complementary since he is so old and if cooperation comes in rapport with the general standard of academic regulation. As a professor, I heard that the type of doctoral education had not been infrequent via TV news, which reported a corruption and unfaith between the professors and students. I had an interest how this case would develop. Nevertheless, all the actors seemed academically sincere and deeply engaged to learn and elevate the quality or merit of dissertation. We had a pleasant time and encouraged has success in the next election. Now the time is eight o'clock to hurry for the Express Bus which was reserved for nine at night. Upon the end of public duty, we gladly had Sake, and the influence seemed to come on my body. One professor uttered, \"Professor Kim is only to have a sleep at the back seat for Seoul.\" He would be a best nomad professor in my classification that his career growth is remarkable both in his research activities and campus service as an administrator. He seemed superior to consider my where-about with care. Since he now serves one of top positions at campus and his wife had recently transferred to near office of Korean prosecution, his nomad-ship may no longer be necessary. However, his nomad-ship seems ironically a pleasure for him. For the alcoholic influence, my soul now enjoys a comfort and night sojourn in the bus will relax the body of this local professor. I may see it not negative that my view had likely been felt as more active in comment and instruction on the dissertation. I simply reflect if I could be engaged deeply this night assuming that I am a settled professor at either Seoul or Gwang-ju. Day 3 Continually over my professional life, I reflect on an identity of self as the kind of foreign student because of the strand of mobility. The lives seem to govern in the concept of flow that naturally contributes to reshape the personhood or social existence. In fact, my background is strongly settled in Seoul for most of my earlier years, but the life pattern had changed once I met the opportunities of study abroad. I had likely been a vagabond of six years in western countries to study and local professorship actually would not be unusual for such foreign educated professors in Korea. In that sense, the nomad professorship in domestic setting actually would seem a little trouble for the kind of professors, and the globalization also accelerated the active interchange of scholarship both for professors and students. In my guess, Korea is one of great patrons for the public education of developed countries, particularly at the doctoral level, who would expect to serve as a professor or expert in the country. That is partly because the cultural imperialism would be underlain in deep dimension of Korean parents and public, which, however, gradually turns on a little different scene about the educational nationalism. Korea would perhaps be distinct to obtain a terminal degree of profession in developed countries while the students of Japan or Germany and France would learn at master level as concocted with the doctoral degree from his home countries. The British and US students perhaps would not see a need to study at foreign countries unless a specific need would arise. That is perhaps because the English language is a usual medium of instruction and primary tool of professional communication. It has once come into the interest of Korean public given one British researcher has obtained his research degree at one of Korean university about the topic of Admiral S.S. Lee for the 16th century Chosen dynasty. For his case, Korea is an original state of that topic which could increase his scholarship and could be helpful to develop his professional career path. One legal researcher from Czechoslovakia now studies at doctoral program of one Korean university, who also was recruited by Korean constitutional court for his ability of Korean language. In this trend, we can see that the current rate of globalization actually is remarkable that the destination of foreign students now more usually be found as bound for Asian nations, including China and South Korea. I reflect on what is best creative to generate the paradigm of national public education. A globalization and hybrid nature of background for teachers and researchers traditionally would be considered a stimulus in many ways, and I see it still seems unchanged if with our neighborly experience. We find the e-communication age impacts highly on a corner of our personal, social and professional existence. This factor seems both positive and negative for the study abroad. In any case, the intellectual community is very prone to receive a diversity and pluralism than any other sector of society and nation, in which my observations would be curious among the foreign students under my supervision, foreigneducated or nomad professors. (b) An Account, Analysis and Consideration The journal writing again leads us to deliberate between the \"number\" and \"words\" or \"signs\" i.e., two ways of conveying human ideas (Creswell, 2009; Delistrat, 2015). Given the words than number now centralize on the qualitative studies, we need to have time to appreciate its quality and service as well as practice on their own journal writing. It is the most discriminative factor that the social scientists have to construct the floor evidence into any meaningful knowledge of society he elaborates to explore. This generally differs from the department of English or comparative literature and history in that they are the disciplines of humanity. Let me tender my brief experience in the dental clinic. I had an appointment on June 13, 2015 with my kindred dentist located in the vicinity of Seoul. The dental clinic shelves a small number of books for the waiting client, and I found one Korean publication detailed the life of Jong-woo Hong, who assassinated Ok-kyun Kim in the last of 20 century of Chosen dynasty. The author seems a historian who likely indulged in a new theoretical highlight for Hong against the prevailing thesis of Korean historians on the importance of Kim and villain imagery of Hong. Hong's action is patriotic in his scholarly dealings, in which he actually portrayed him as decent nobility for the demising dynasty. Kim is generally decorated as the revered transformative leader in that period of time while Hong is merely an assassinator. That prejudice was rejected based on the types of evidence, as well as his views and opinions. His scholarly discussion was also sophisticated to meet the national standard of history research, but I readily came to realize that it could not be a process of social scientist. My point is that the method is virtually same for the qualitative researchers in the social science, but must differ one another (Laureate Education, Inc. 2010e; Patton, 2002). Over ten pieces of photo were inserted to strengthen his argument and proposition to counter the mainstream awareness. The journal writings of Hong were attached at the end of his publication, which, of course, is supposed to replicate his doctoral dissertation. Even his own journal writing, as sectioned in the title, \"Presumptive Dialogue with Hong,\" was sketched around twenty pages long. It is interesting whether we consider it as a class of traditional journal writing since it is presumptive or constructive -hence not factual-merely fallen upon the imagination of one historian. The publication read interesting and provocative that I seem surely sympathetic if he claims for his doctoral degree of history (2010e). Nevertheless, the qualitative social scientists have to take a more extensive work on the group notion (Hunt, Colander, 2015; Kim, K., 2013). They have to adapt their evidence gathered over the deep and long fatigue of field work to some kind of meaningful scope of target group (2015). The dimension of history awareness may be impacted from that fine research work, but the author generally had not needed to raise the voice of specific group in the society. They may not get mindful to heighten the awareness of recidivists to any better practice of public policy that could more effectively prevent the repeat crimes. Nevertheless, I felt that the journal writing in the form of antedated remnants and antiques of photo seem very convincing and impressive to support the author's allegation of new understanding. That seems a strand that has to be utilized at best extent by the qualitative researchers concerning the society-perhaps the mixture of humans and universe as Patton illustrated. Now we can even agree if we could incorporate the video materials as one form of qualitative evidence. It would hardly be deniable as evidence although some scientists might allege on a decency of science. That is because we generally agree that the first value of science is its authenticity and truths than decency. In any case, I was impressed with his publication that the evidence is on the real life of Hong although it showed, in one sense, that quotidian life was too banal to document. It had been mundane and routine, but simply led me into the thought \"Isn't it more important to remember extraordinary moments: first steps, graduations, jobs, awards, marriage, retirement, vacations?\" I was reminded of a preaching from of psychologists that relying on the brain's mechanisms alone can be a fool's game and humans have a tendency to misremember and to forget even the recent past (Delistrat, 2015). It seems true to merit the journal writing that \"memories can be swayed by future events, by the memories of others, and the details that seem so certain turn out to be entirely misguided.\" This preaching was a beginning lesson when I started three pieces of journal writing, which excited me to be precious and joyful to record my past event. The journal writing is the kind of evidence which would constitute a vast portion of qualitative studies (Creswell, 2013). It could turn into the meaningful data with the aid of NVivo and encoding or analysis that contrasts with the quantitative studies (Janesick, 2011). Hence, the journal writing, especially that of researcher, has to be considered how journal writing can help with the development of qualitative researcher. As an answer, we can raise focal aspects of consideration (i) the writing is preferred to be convivial, direct, emotive, and with routine living words (ii) the writing has to be connected with the theme of research (iii) the writing can be planned in the long span of professional lives for research and teaching. In the first aspect, the journal writer starts with an entrance meditation, dates every entry, keeps what you write, writes quickly, tells yourself truth, and writes naturally. Through the three days of journal writing, I minded to satisfy this aspect. The expression and vocabularies are of routine nature, as we see, for example, summer vacation, final exam, fishing venture, Requiem of Mozart, eight o'clock, Express Bus and so on (Conner, 2009). Names of person other than scholar, specific place, real time had a frequency in my writing as if the real issues had been concerned or ground theory on theory building had been tasted. In terms of second aspect, the writing has been keyed in the routines of local professor since my theme is nomad professors of Alpha University or Korean local universities. For example, the story and context with Dr. Park and one professor on the third day has a connection with the theme of nomad professors. A comparative inquiry with the foreign students and foreign professors or other similar group in CU would imply of the development of theme. In order to be more faithful with the second aspect, writing techniques would be helpful with a timed writing process designed to bring focus and intensity in short bursts. This technique particularly would be excellent for those who are resistant or aversive to journal writing or who are uncertain about how to start or who state they do not have time to write journals. This situation was mine that I minded to come short, but focused and intense as to deal with my theme. The journal writing would appear the kind of inventory if completed in satisfactory manner (Gardner, Lawn, Ridi, Schakel, 2012). I have exerted on an assessment of life balance in major areas of living and tried to give a quick picture of which life areas might need attention, especially as connected with the theme of nomad professor. Although the usual guide, such as sentence stem, clustering, lists of 100, had not been tangible in three journal writings above, the strategy can be employed in the future experience, and be kept effective in an implied way to deliver the purpose of journal writing. I intended to apply the captured moments that vignettes capturing the sensation of a particularly meaningful or emotional experience could bring a focus and intensity to develop the theme. There are many other techniques that the journal writers had to train themselves. In terms of third aspect, scholars pointed out the importance of journal writing for learning and education. This aspect, therefore, also relates with the development of professional career. Clark explored structured learning journals for the goals and experiential learning for gerontology students (Boud, 2001). The interdisciplinary health care teams benefit with the ongoing developmental dialogue presented in the form (i) observational notes, with little interpretation; (ii) theoretical notes that attempt to make meaning of the observations and experiences; and (iii) methodological notes, a \"kind of written bulletin board\" on which to post metacognitive reminders about the learning process (2001). Oaks also found that distance learners would learn many of the functions of a collaborative group through the replica of structured learning journal. According to Holt, the reflective journals are also used in the preparation of adult educators, and the typical of observation, speculation, doubt, questioning, self-awareness, problem stating, problem solving, emoting, and ideation included in the journal would enhance the cognitive activities of writer and readers. In sum, the learning journal is a systematic way of documenting learning and collecting information for self-analysis and reflection (2001). This quality could bring that it could be used in an adult education class, and could be an inventory of qualitative researchers in response with his or her career path. The e-age also would be a factor to shape a new mode of interaction that, according to McIntyre and Tlusty, electronic mail would be an avenue for a reflective dialog on teaching practice for pre-service teachers. This third aspect had been considered when I composed my journal writings. For example, I have adverted on the quality of journal writing for the social scientist and modern thoughts that could taste a kind of written bulletin board in which post megacognitive reminders likely stressed on the learning process relating with the nomad professor and post-modern reality of such group. We also can find that the observational notes and theoretical notes had duly balanced as we read, \"One professor uttered, 'Professor Kim is only to have a sleep at the back seat for Seoul.' He would be a best nomad professor in my classification that his career growth is remarkable both in his research activities and campus service as an administrator. He seems superior to consider my whereabout with care.\" In the context of online learning, it will be true that the discussion post and response could be one form of structured learning journal which allows to learn many functions of Walden peer students. The dissertations of qualitative method introduced to enhance the learning could also be a good service since it could relate the scholarly sophistication with the implied qualitative data, perhaps based on the journal writings or summary of in-depth interviews (Gardner, Lawn, Ridi, Schakel, 2012). In the preparation of professional researcher career, the journal writings could be a part of qualitative scholars, whose tone and attitude would be reflected in the lecture room and course of research activities. This aspect could be hinted in my journal writings which likely forged myself to devote to the studies of foreign or nomad story and context within the area of educational policy (Patton, 2002). \"Continually over my professional life, I reflect on an identity of self as the kind of foreign student because of the strand of mobility. The lives seem to govern in the concept of flow that naturally contributes to reshape the personhood or social existence.... A globalization and hybrid nature of background for teachers and researchers traditionally would be considered a stimulus in many ways, and I see it still seems unchanged with our neighborly experience. We find the e-communication age impacts highly on a corner of our personal, social and professional existence.\" Reference Boud, D. (2001).

Selecting an Approach for a Qualitative Research Plan (a) The Research Questions As previously discussed, my research questions would comprise two central questions and eight sub-questions as follows. (A) Who are the nomad professors? 1. What characterizes the nomad professors? 2. How do we properly make them distinct from their peers with one settled residence? 3. How do we differentiate other professionals of similar identity or living mode? (B) How do they deal with their responsibilities and manage a personhood or social existence? 1. How do they manage their personhood or social existence? 2. How do they perceive or consider them with their counterparts or other professionals in the context of teaching performance? 1. How do they perceive or consider them with their counterparts or other professionals in the context of research performance? 2. How do they perceive or consider them with the counterparts or other professionals in the context of university administration? 3. How do they perceive or consider them with the counterparts or other professionals in the context of his overall professional lives? (b) Five Qualitative Approaches, A Best fit and Next fit According to Creswell, we can class five major types of qualitative research including (i) narrative research (ii) phenomenological research (iii) grounded theory research (iv) ethnographic research (v) case studies. These five methods have common character as qualitative studies, but could be differentiated based on (i) definition and background (ii) defining features (iii) types (iv) procedure for conducting each method (v) challenges (2013).For example, narrative research has long been patronized by the disciplines of literature, history, anthropology, sociology, sociolinguistics, and education, and the procedures for implementing this research would differ from other methods in that the focus is on studying one or two individuals (2013). The defining feature of narrative research is that it collects stories from individuals, and may be co-constructed between the researcher and participants. That differs from an emphasis on a phenomenon, often phrased in terms of a single concept or idea, from the phenomenological research. As my research question centers on the nomad professor, both ways may be plausible since it could be a phenomenon as the \"professional growth\" in education, \"grief\" in the psychological concept, \"caring relationship\" in the health idea or themes of denial, fear, safety retriggering and campus planning of gunman incident (2013). On the while, the key word includes nomad \"professor\", which possibly can mean that it could be a story from individuals. I would have examined life events or epiphanies, which, however, are merely part of evidence. In fact, it seems a wider scope of phenomenology identifiable not only within the Alpha University, but also stretched into many other local universities. A share of target group seems also greater which is supposed to amount around twenty percents of whole professors. They may, in view of this statistical guess, properly classed as ethnographic subjects. This character would position this research as phenomenological or ethnographic research (Douglas, Johansen, 2006). While the grounded theory research would give a focus on a process or an action and often aims at theory building with the concept map or interactive relationships as well as consequence (Norton, 2001), the major attribute of my research would seem less related with action or movement as destined for vigorous policy suggestion, advocacy of specific group, and awakening of social activism. That is true although I may use a debriefing as if conducted by counselors or would have tried out surreal experiences of subjects in the procedure. Hence, the quality of grounded theory research could be a part of my research, but more importance would lie in the \"essences\" drawn from observations, interviews and documentary examination, which is closer to other approach than grounded theory research. In comparison with the grounded theory where the study participants are not likely to be located in the same place or interacting so frequent a basis, the ethnographic research is more convenient to develop shared patterns of behavior, beliefs, and language, hence, looking into the micro-culture of cultural group (Creswell, 2013). However, the campus community has a constellation of diverse groups and I am skeptical if the nomad professors would be nerves at edge, i.e., a key concept to be expected for the ethnographic research. Nevertheless, it would be close to it provided that the sample would be larger than grounded theory study in which the researcher is immersed in the day-to day lives of the people and observes and interviews the group participants (2013). This aspect of research operation would profile vastly in my research, whose feature would focus on developing a complex, complete description of the culture of group or culture sharing group. It would not begin merely with an \"abiding concern\" unlike the phenomenological studies although the bracketing myself may be utilized to discuss personal experiences with the research themes. Husserl's concept, epoche, would be practiced as necessary in order to maximize the fresh perspective toward the phenomenon and the intentionality of consciousness could characterize my research (2013). This can partly make it as to be classified within the phenomenological studies. The categorical approach is one of characteristic residing within the grounded theory research, which could be found in the sections of inquiry in terms of sub-questions above. Five categories beginning from the personhood or social existence, to teaching and research, and through the role of university administration were designed, and I also hopefully intends to generate or discover a theory applicable to other local universities or nomad professionals generally. This aspect may situate the research more adequately within the grounded theory method (Norton, 2001). Nevertheless, the focus would be simple to describe the essences of concept that would not be such systemic as provided with causal conditions, axial coding paradigm, or conditional matrix, or such lived focus on the hermeneutical phenomenology. This could reinforce a view that the ethnographic research is closer to it in terms of methodological trait. The case studies is seen as same to target the entire culture-sharing group, but could differ in that it develops an in-depth understanding of a single case or explore an issue or problem using the case as a specific illustration (Creswell, 2013). The identification of a specific case is a starting point and cases could be either concrete, e.g., small group, an organization, partnership -or soft, e.g. community, a relationship, a decision process, or a specific project (2013). In this aspect, the research seems highly pertinent with the case method, and especially true if the research deals with the nomad professors within the bounded system. It is also plausible that the information will be gleaned from multiple sources, say, interviews, observations, audio-visual materials, journal writings, and so. The critical divisive line in my view is whether the purpose of study is limited to illuminate the essences concerning the shared patterns of behaviors, beliefs and language or if it could develop in more depth into the issue or concern relating with public policy or administration. In this case, the research may fall within the instrumental case study or collective case study. In the intrinsic case study, the final type of case studies, the focus is on the case itself than the issue or concern, which would possibly approximate the ethnographic research. Nevertheless, we can distinguish if the ethnographic research is more group oriented than case-focused. Given the general similarity as a national professorship of nomad professors with their counterparts, we can find vast of commonalities so that the case studies would be a best fit for my research plan. This is so provided if the issue or concern from the framework of public policy discipline would be to substantiate the utility of research. Although the nomad professors would more properly be a phenomenon or distinct cultural group in vast sense-implying with phenomenological or ethnographic method, it could equally be true that the single site investigation suffices the shared patterns across the local universities- implying with most simple one site case studies. The next fit would be ethnographic studies. Despite these classifications, the points are that the research plan designed as qualitative studies generally is open-ended and iterative over the actual stage of research operation, which troubles any definite classification, especially in the earlier stage of research. This is to suggest that the preoccupation with method or methodology is not necessarily effective or governing (Baradaran, Shima, 2014). Nevertheless, the Creswell's diagram is helpful with many illustrations and can also help with this discussion as focused in his five foci (2013). And you also will read some reflection about the character of qualitative research with my day experience below. Figure The Characteristics and Research on the Nomad Professors Characteristics Narrative Research Phenomenology Grounded Theory Ethnography Case Study Focus O O O Type of Problem Best Suited for Design O O Discipline Background O O Unit of Analysis O O O O Data Collection Form O O Data Analysis Strategies O O Written Report O O (c) Reflections These days I had time on my video lecture conducted in English. Since we teach in Korea, the Korean language is the most popular and natural medium of instruction. The Korean Open Course Ware is the public program managed by the government support foundation, which provides lectures of Nobel Laureate, members of the Korean Academy, university professors and lecturers. It collected over thousands of public lecture and scholarly articles at the public availability. It is the kind of Korean MOOK, the concept toward the universalized public education without a barrier. A small number of lectures are available at non-Korean language and subsidized from the foreign source, such as Indiana University and UC Santa Barbara. Some of Korean professors contributed his or her English lectures, one of whom is myself. The lecture was originally recorded with less than sound that embarrassed me about its disservice for the audience. I have not known if it could be cured. My wife readily helped that we could buy an amplifier from the computer store. It then could be audited in normal sound that we had an unusual time to listen the English-based lecture. It perhaps would be impressive if a mid-aged madam usually does not encounter the lecture of professors, even seldom with that of spoken English. Now it is the time of her precious comment, \"It likely sounds your English.\" I originally had expected to hear \"It seems likely from native speaker\" or \"it is less proficient to allow a guess if the speaker is foreigneducated other than English speaking countries.\" Her response was unique, but I soon realized in the context of weekly course objective. The qualitative researchers are often described as subject oriented and put an emphasis on human's whole story as a component of universe. It is projected and enduring, a part of deep dimension less frivolous nor rectifiable comparatively than the assumption of research sample of quantitative researchers (Kim, 2015). Simply, we may be less waked when we reply for the five scale of surveys. We would be more certain and affected deeply with the gunman incidents involved with narrative studies or ethnographic research. We generally ascribe as \"intact cultural group\" when we begin with our qualitative design of research. We perhaps speak \"intact\" to describe \"unstudied or unearthed.\" Ironically, \"intact\" seems more adequate to describe the subjects of quantitative studies if received in usual use. The participants of quantitative studies would truly be intact as if we respond with the Walden survey of class evaluation at the end of quarter, election poll or public survey about the policy aftermath upon the occurrence of Sewol ferry tragedy of Korea last year. The indepth investigation of victims' family and close friends concerning the essence of Sewol incident would undertake a different quality of research (May, Malcolm, 1996). In this case, the scope of participants would not be intact, but deeply affected, many of whom suffer from trauma and embarrassment. Some of them would feel like better to commit a suicide, but also truly intact if they are not studied. It seems the kind of equivalent with the gun shooting problem in US settings. We often tell that the victims of this kind would be our neighbors and precious components of society. We often have a focus if the qualitative research has a worth of study more frequently than those of quantitative approach (Laureate Education, 2010e). Of course, professionally speaking, it may be contested in the competitive process of NSF grants or other funding institutions. My point is that they are not only neighbors of sharing, but also reveal the kind of intellectual destination that we are said to be truly intellectual. I have once introduced my studies on Korean constitutional court, and we know the modern focus of European philosophical curiosity, such as post-modernism, existentialism and so on. Creswell also illustrated the intellectual stream from Husseri through Heidegger, Sartre, and MerieauPonty as to relate with the phenomenological research (2013). The modern being may be extant under the circumstances of affectation that the risk society from Ulrich Beck is not the story of others. We Korean people had long been affected to have a judiciary of advanced modality, and 1987 Korean reform of constitution had truly been momentous. The focus group or ethnographical scope would be less general nor normalized given its intensity on Korea, but thankfully was considered a worth of study. Without a deep awareness of affected people and sharing, the research scheme may eventually go futile (May, Malcolm, 1996). The context above sketched can be summarized (i) in-depths dimension of truths (ii) affectation, rapport or sharing (iii) intellectual standard as pertinent to understanding the status of qualitative studies. In terms of sharing and intellectual standard, one note needs to remark on the current transformation of e-age that the rapid growth of on-line journals would be illustrative. For example, India or Chinese based on-line journals likely become rampant to create their own circle of professional communication beyond the traditionally indexed journals. The open access movement for professional sharing on articles and books is another trend as notable. KOCW is one of example now in service for the public. Let me return to the first example to reflect on the philosophy of disciplines- perhaps – and basis of qualitative method. As known, Creswell perceived that, in terms of qualitative method or phenomenological studies, the subjective and objective dichotomy prevailed over the enlightenment age as a intellectual basis would be less adequate to understand the humans and universe, say, the kind of society on which we often elaborate if setting aside the inside space of Space-shuttle or Moon Explorers (2013). Plainly we can retrospect how the work of geography department, one of social science disciplines and adjacent with anthropology, would have an interest and we come to realize that their concerns are not merely a work of cartography or description of physical trait between the urban and rural areas. The element of human is common across the disciplines of social science although the assumption of human is made a little different between two methods (Creswell, 2009; Patton, 2002). In the qualitative studies, the assumption would be thicker, particular and dimensional that may be ascribable to the Greek paradigm, say, whole of being, but more prototypical than social. This may be used as a basis of skepticism from the quantitative circle of adherents. The qualitative researchers may counter if the essence of humans could be so abstract and neutral between the subject and object. For them, the exterior world, perhaps object for the subjects, is likely consumable to the life and humanity. The object is theirs as affected and less separable, perhaps said less cool, but heated. A journal writing in the previous lesson would have a focus on this aspect. One other factor could be related with the medical facts of human element, who would be aged, infirm and eventually die. The phenomenological studies would have a service for the discipline of nursing science, public health and education (Dahnke, Dreher, 2010). In this aspect, we may see if the practical reality of humans would be more persuasive with the interviews and lengthy observations than computer aided marking of public survey. The instant utterance of my wife is very interesting to disappoint my expectation. It was \"your English\" than general comment. The object and subject are immersed in this case as the qualitative focus would highlight. The comment also survive many potential Korean English speaking persons, perhaps herself, who should speak English in this highly globalized community. The comment entails \"sharing of English\" and \"affectation\" as a Korean foreign. It showed a \"deep engagement\" since we had time for twenty minutes in listening. Most importantly, the object and subject were not coolly separated that \"immersed me and general context of English-based lecture.\" My expected comment would go otherwise to make me stand among the two objects --lectures of native speaker, English lecture generally, and one subject -myself. In her comment, no objective scale can intervene about proficiency or native manner of lecture, but merely one man of existentialism. Her comment eventually made me laugh, but it seems to locate the attribute of qualitative research, and the kind of philosophical understanding. The qualitative research is surely to be attested to by multivocal discourse. B. On the Five Approaches of Qualitative Method (a) Essences of the Five Qualitative Approaches The qualitative research generally includes five major approaches (i) narrative research (ii) phenomenology (iii) grounded theory research (iv) ethnographic studies (v) case method (Creswell, 2013). In this assignment, I will describe the major profile of those approaches, and demonstrate the tentative research plans within a fit of each approach. (b) A Narrative Research The narrative research has many forms, and narrative has dual sense as a phenomenon being studied or method used in a study (Creswell, 2013). The study focus would be one or two individuals, and narrative can be spoken or written. The data are gathered through the collection of stories, report of individual experiences, and chronologically orders of the meaning of those experiences (Kim, K. 2014). It impacted on the disciplines of literature, anthropology, sociology, sociolinguistics, and education. The defining feature would underlie in the stories from individuals, individual experiences, many different forms of data, chronology, varied ways of analysis, turning points of specific tensions or interruptions, specific places or situation (Bernad, Ryan, 2009). The types of narrative research would cover a biographical study, auto-ethnography, life history and oral history (Creswell, 2013). For example, the biographical study engaged with the researcher who writes and records the experiences of another person's life while the individuals are the subject of study in the auto-ethnography, who writes and records. The procedures for conducting narrative research are shown in the following diagram (2013). The challenges inhere with the procedures and characteristics. For example, the multilayered context of a life, as viewed by Edel, would make it hard and strained to uncover the \"figure under the carpet\" (2013). Multiple issues arise in the research process to be constantly vigil by asking, for example, \"Who owns the story?\" or \"As a community, what do stories do among us?\" Figure 1 Procedures for Conducting the Narrative Research (c) A Phenomenological Research The phenomenological research supposes a concept or a phenomenon which would be described of the common meaning for several individuals of their lived lives (Creswell, 2013). The basic purpose is to reduce individual experiences with a phenomenon and the researchers would be curious to excavate and describe the universal essence of phenomenon (Patton, 2002). For example, the nursing studies or public health on MERs-CoV would be a phenomenon or concept that might be described of its universal essence, but with variations within specific context. It is popular in social and health science, and challenged the scientism for exploration on empirical means by the end of the 19th century with the intentionality of consciousness (Hunt, Colander, 2015). For example, the studies on anomie would be an exemplar in the modern sociological studies. The defining features would be refusal of the subject-object dichotomy and they would be remiss to not deal with the traditional philosophy enamored with empirical science for positioning their research purpose or problem. The defining features of phenomenology would underlie (i) emphasis on a phenomenon (ii) exploration of phenomenon with a group of individuals (iii) philosophical discussion (iii) bracketing himself or herself (iv) data collection primarily with the Determines if the research best fist narrative research Select one or more individuals wh tell stories or life experiences Consider data collection and their recording Collection of Information about the Stories Analysis of the Participant's Stories Collaboration with Partipants interviewing (v) Data analysis from narrow units to broader units through detailed descriptions (vi) description of universal essences (Creswell, 2013; Bernad, Ryan, 2009). For example, bracketing occurs when the nurses or medical doctors in Korea now are the kind of authors and participants in understanding the phenomenology of MERs-CoV. The types of phenomenology include the hermeneutic phenomenology and empirical, transcendental or psychological phenomenology. The researchers upon completion of data collection and analysis would develop the textual description, structural description at next and finally culminates at overall essence of the experience. The procedures for conducting phenomenological research basically pertain to the definition and characteristics. In the first, the researcher determines if the research can be investigated most effectively by employing this approach. In the next, the steps will be taken (i) identification of phenomenon (ii) placing their research within the broad philosophical assumptions of phenomenology (iii) data collection from the experienced individuals (iv) open-ended, two broad and general questions (What experience in terms of phenomenon and what contexts or situations?) (v) phenomenological data analysis from significant statements, to textual description, to imaginative variation or structured description, and through the essential, invariant structure or essence. Despite the utility of this approach, the challenges are not little if the research is delicate on philosophical assumptions, implied attitude of previous researchers on philosophical assumption, general requirement of same experienced samples, and no clear-cut deals with bracketing. (d) A Grounded Theory Research As differs from the above two approaches, the grounded theory research often intends to move beyond description and to generate or discover a theory, i.e., a unified theoretical explanation (Creswell, 2013). The research findings, in turn, could provide a further framework for future research. Although it culminates at a theory, it would not be yielded \"off the shelf,\" but based on the grounded data (Bernad, Ryan, 2009). This method originated from the several books of two sociologists in 1967, named B. Glaser and A. Strauss. A little varied form had followed to depart from too principled and structured dealings of original approach, what we call a constructivist grounded theory by Charmaz (Creswell, 2013). Later, the positivist underpinnings and postmodern perspective became relied on. In this stream, the approach is highly critical on situations, arenas, and positional cartographic maps for data collection and analysis. They then require the researchers to reshuffle themselves from \"all knowing analysts\" to the \"acknowledged participants\" as a churning and refreshed theory developer (2013). They had it to be elementary between the political nature of research and interpretation and reflexivity on the part of researchers, implying that the subjective predisposition of researcher is most cautionary as to taint the authenticity and credibility of research (Kim, 2013). The defining features of this approach would underlie (i) a process or an action as a research focus (ii) purpose of approach to develop a theory (iii) memoing as an important part of process to relate the data with the theory (iv) interviewing as a primary source of data collection (v) typical data analysis process with categories and axial and selective coding (Creswell, 2013). The two popular approaches of grounded theory studies would include the systemic procedures and constructivist approach (2013). The theoretical sampling and constant comparative method of data analysis dealing with categories are a critical element to define this approach. The open coding is the beginning point of this research, and can develop with causal conditions, strategies, intervening conditions, consequences, axial coding, selective coding and propositions (2013). The conditional matrix developed by Strauss and Corbin is an applied form to substantiate the concept, process, an action, interaction and interrelationships among the categories. The procedures for conducting this approach are briefed within the following diagram. The challenges could be present (i) the need to set aside, as much as possible, theoretical ideas or notions (ii) researcher's exposure to the approach (iii) difficulty of determining a saturation or perfection-discriminant sampling as alternative (iv) less flexibility of original approach (2013). Figure 2 Procedures for Conducting the Grounded Theory Research (e) An Ethnographic Research The fourth approach is an ethnographic research, which focuses on an entire culturesharing group (Creswell, 2013). While the cultural group may vary in size, it is often large, such as black people in the public high schools and veterans of combat war in North Carolina. The researchers may group a sedentary desk workers in urban cities, of whom he or she expects the shared and learned patterns of their values, behaviors, beliefs, and language. The approach often requires an extended observation of participants where the researcher himself is immersed in their lives deeply and through the day-to-day contact. In this backdrop, the approach had impacted on disciplines and social philosophy, such as cognitive or cultural Determines if grounded theory is best suited The research questions : (i) indiidual experience of the process (ii) the core phenomenon (iii) causal conditions (iv) strategies (v) consequences Primarily data from interviewing, and other froms including observations, documents and audiovisual materials Data analysis on several properties or subcategories/axial coding and coding paradigm or logic diagram Theory , a sunstantive level theory and help with memoing anthropology or sociology as well as structural functionalism, symbolic interactionism, and post-modernism (Patton, 2002). The defining features of ethnographies would include the following strands (i) complex, complete, description of the cultural group (ii) patterns on their ideas, beliefs and behaviors (iii) intact and discernible working patterns (iii) a threaded role of theory in developing the research design (iv) extensive field work and diverse sources of evidence, such as interviews, observations, symbols, artifacts (v) emic perspective on verbatim quotes and etic scientific perspective of researcher's to develop overall cultural interpretation (vi) determining inquiry of general nature concerning the work system and knowledge of group participants (Creswell, 2013). While there are many forms of ethnography, tow popular forms would be the realist and critical ethnography. Within the realist ethnography, the research describes an objective account of the situation, who will be an omniscient reporter of the facts and narrates the study in a third-person dispassionate voice (Janesick, 2011). The critical ethnography responds with current society in which the marginalized group often is studied in the tone of advocacy. The researchers typically are politically minded, and their issues would be power, empowerment, inequality,, inequity, dominance, repression, hegemony and victimization. Their focus prefers value–laden orientation, empowering people, challenging the status quo, and addressing concerns about power and control (Creswell, 2013). You will see in the figure the procedures for conducting ethnography. The ethnography has the challenges (i) in-depth exposure to the cultural anthropology (ii) time consuming on data collection (iii) narrative style writing amazing the traditional scientific writers (iv) venturous, for example, going native and incompletion or compromise during the research operation (2013). Figure 3 Procedures for Conducting the Ethnographic Research (f) A Case Study Research The case study research involves the study of a case within a real –life, and develops an in-depth understanding of a single case although it often studies the culture sharing group (Creswell, 2013). The bounded system is typical, which is an object of study as well as a product of inquiry (Kim, 2014). The data collection involves multiple sources of information -observations, interviews, audiovisual materials, documents and reports-and requires a time consuming, detailed and in-depth work (Bernad, Ryan, 2009). The researcher conducts a multisite study or within site study, and their work product usually would be a case description or case themes. The defining features of case studies are (i) it begins with the identification of specific case (ii) the intent of case study often bifurcates within the intrinsic case and instrumental case (iii) in-depth understanding of case and diverse forms of qualitative data (iv) single or multiple and hybrid of data analysis. (v) description of the case and themes or issues (vi) chronology or across-cases comparison and theoretical model (vii) conclusion in the form of assertions, patterns or explanations (Creswell, 2013). The case study has three major forms which include the intrinsic case study, instrumental case study and collective case study. For example, the researcher engaged in the collective case study conducts multiple case studies to illustrate the issue and the logic of replication may apply. Determine if it is a best fit Identify and locate a culture sharing group to study Select cultural themes, issues, or theories to study about the group Determine the type of ethnography Information Gathering Analysis of Data and Description of Cultural Group A working set of rules or generalizations The procedures for conducting a case study is (i) determination of a fit with this approach (ii) identification of their case or cases (iii) extensive data collection and diverse forms (iv) holistic analysis of the entire case or embedded analysis of a specific aspect of a case (v) interpretation and report of the meaning of the case (2013). The challenges of case study would be (i) difficulties in identifying the case, for example, broad or narrow, what bounded system, single case or multiple cases (ii) rationale for his or her purposeful sampling strategy (2013). (g) The Research Problem In the Korean society, the recruitment of college professors is one important event for the departmental people. As similar with the convention of other countries, the process is competitive and rigorous to draw upon a caliber of applicants, and would be a key concern for the professors and chair of department or dean of schools. More frequently in Korea, the tumult and harms likely would be involved in the recruitment of new professors. That often would be an issue of fairness and competition among the applicants, but often embroils with the corruption or anti-competitive practice with prior compromise or brokerage of powerful professors (Bowen, 2015). It could anchor within the antipathy and dissension of departmental people. It seriously undermines the unity, morale and even socialization of them. In 2013, the College of Social Science in the Alpha University announced a job vacancy for full-time professorship, who will work in the department of military science. Around ten applicants had been processed for one post and typical of three stages -two times works evaluation and interview -in the screening process were conducted, in which A and B were selected for final review. B was dropped out and the announcement of department is that no applicant was suited to the job vacancy and the process ended without a selection. This pattern of \"watering\" in the selection process is the stereotype that many Korean universities had practiced when their need arises. The problem is that it could be used for the powerful professors or those in office who intends to shape the pool of professors under their taste and influence. B is a young promising scholar who earned a bachelor degree in CU, hence, an alma mater of the university. He studied under the supervision of C, who is also alma mater, studied on the political science in China for his master and doctoral degrees and now serves as a distinguished professor in the CSS. The campus ethos would prefer B since professors would agree to staff a CU graduate for the faculty in terms of balance and proportionality. That is typically stranded in this case if he followed his academic supervisor to study abroad in China for his graduate degree. His field of expertise is keenly related with the Chinese intelligence given his main interest is on the East Asian politics so that nobody could deny his qualification for the vacancy--at least on his apparent career path. He was rejected although his supervisor had been vehement to represent his cause and claims, and established a public network with the campus members to critique the schematic watering leading to his failure and accusation of his unethical conduct of plagiarism by a group of powerful professors. While the screening process was taken by the department, the key group had based their claim on the flaws of his scholarly works. The confrontation of B and C against over five major faculty members had been under wake about one year, and as notorious to the campus members (2015). The standard of research ethics and plagiarism were disputed to purchase the outside expert groups and even brought to the court proceeding for the legality of recruitment decision. The trauma and embarrassment had seemed obvious to the involved professors, and their statement of public relationship as well as the letter of dispute or argument had been exchanged openly along the notice of other campus members. B was eventually hired for the position, but the aftermath is serious about the socialization of departmental members. In June, 2015, the disciplinary board of CU administration had decided three months suspension, decrease of salary and reprimand for the opposing professors against B. The case of B actually is very striking in terms of its impact and pattern of development, which differs in aspects from the controversies of this kind normally observed in other universities in Korea. For example, the final hiring decision often ends the confrontation and antipathy among the professors in dissension and disagreement – at least n terms of official context. The situation here seems not discontinued soon and after. While B had spent his second semester upon employment, the disciplinary decision surprised the campus members for their severity and imbalance given if their behavior as a role professor in the recruitment process. They had been said futile to hand off their primary role as a professor, say, teaching and research performance desisted for over two years. The social aspect of department seems immeasurable with a loss and damage of affection and congruence (Hunt, Colander, 2015). Therefore, the issue of failed recruitment process in the colleges and universities of South Korea is serious to affect the professors and students in terms of various dimensions, i.e., social, educational and university administration (2015). (h) A Tentative Research on the Narrative Studies The purpose of this research stems from the overriding interest of author, in which he will explore the conflicting stories that emerged during the data collection. B was chosen for study by the researcher because he could inform how the bias and turfs of faculty society would lead to injustice and impropriety and narrate the paradigm or expectations from department, college and university as well as concerned professors in the recruitment process (Lombardi, 2013). B will tell stories about specific incidents in his two years experience and observations will be culled to deal with the aspects of research problem. From a thematic analysis of these data, the author will present several conflicting stories; tensions between his supervisor and several other powerful group of professors; conflicting stories about the fairness and unabridged competition of applicants; conflicting stories for the proper role and justice of university administration; tensions for the goodness of homogeneity and congruence within the department; conflicting views and ideas for the development of department (Creswell, 2013). This narrative study will include the author's reflection on his experiences, for example, how the different events he participated in shaped his understanding, how opportunities arose to build trust, how his relationship with B was negotiated, and how he developed a sense of advocacy for this young professor. The end of study will be culminated with an heightened awareness of failed faculty recruitment process in Korea, for example, the challenges of young scholars in the recruitment process, turfs and disagreement of influential faculty members, similarities and differences between urban and local universities, and the aftermath of failed process (Laureate Education, 2010e). It will be an example of life-based literary narrative as typical of narrative studies (Creswell, 2013).  The researcher collected stories from a single individual, B, a young scholar and applicant for the teaching post of CU  The research will use the collaborative nature of data collection and establish a firm relationship over time between the researcher and the participant in the study.  The research chose to focus on the experiences of this one individual and, more specifically, on the cultural identity of this applicant.  The researcher plans to explore this cultural identity through different forms of data such as personal observations, interviews, field notes, and attendance at events.  The researcher collected data from the beginning of controversy since 2013, and the narrative will be constructed in chronology.  The researcher uses a thematic analysis of reporting \"what happened\" to this individual and other professors in concern and embroilment.  The researcher highlights specific tensions that arose in each of themes, for example, the most recent one of disciplinary measure against the allegedly turf group of professors.  The researcher will discuss the place or the context of CSS of CU where most of the incidents occurred that will be reported in the narrative. (i) A Tentative Research on the Phenomenological Studies The study discusses the emotion or images, and cognitive representations that the faculty members will hold about the failed process of faculty recruitment (Creswell, 2013). The researchers will explore this topic because understanding how faculty members represent the failed process of faculty recruitment and their emotional response to it will influence their performance as well as personal, professional and social satisfaction within the campus. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore faculty experience and cognitive representations of failed process of faculty recruitment within the context of phenomenology. The researcher will introduce the study by referring to the cases of campus controversy charted over the decades, and advanced the framework dealing with the satisfaction and emotion of workers from the failed incidents within the workplace. The research design involved the study of 35 professors deeply concerned of recent development from the faculty recruitment of CSS of CU. The researcher will use phenomenology and the procedures advanced by Colaizzi and Moustakas (Creswell, 2013). For over three months, he will conduct interviews with these 35 professors, and ask them \"What is experience with the failed recruitment process?\" \"Do you have an image or emotion of this incident or how would you describe the failed process?\" \"What meaning does it have in your life?\" The analysis will include 5 major themes based on 220 significant statements. The study will end with a discussion in which the researcher will describe the essences of the professor's experience and influences on their personal, social and professional lives. It is the phenomenological research on square aspects (2013).  A phenomenon – cognitive representations of failed faculty recruitment process by professors – will be examined.  Rigorous data collection with a group of individuals through 35 interviews and journal writings will be used (Janesick, 2011).  The researcher will only briefly mention the philosophical ideas behind phenomenology. Bracketing his personal experiences and exploration of lived experiences will be an important component of research.  The data collection will consist of 35 interviews conducted over 6 months at three sites dedicated to concerned professors, a university faculty restaurant, a long term facility of campus unity.  The use of systemic data analysis procedures of significant statements, meanings, themes, and an exhaustive description of the essence of the phenomenon.  The inclusion of tables to illuminate between the raw data and exhaustive description of the essence of study.  The study will end by describing the essence of the experience for the 36 professors and the context in which they experienced the failed process. (j) A Tentative Research on the Grounded Theory Method This grounded theory research seeks to develop a theory of impact on the faculty society arising from the failed recruitment process that explains the pathways linking key factors together for the personal, social and professional adjustment and development. It was premised on the problem that the failed recruitment process is of concern for particular subgroups, such as departmental, college, and campus-wide peers (Creswell, 2013). To this end, the researcher chose grounded theory because of lack of knowledge regarding the specific factors and relationships that comprise the affectation, adjustment and strategic response. The author will study 10 professors of same college and the other ten from campuswide departments who meet the criterion of sampling. Participants were recruited through the personal contact, and data will be collected through face-to-face in-depth interviews follower by two focus groups after preliminary findings are disseminated. These data will be analyzed using the Strauss and Corbin approach to grounded theory consisting of coding, concept development, constant comparisons between the data and the emerging concepts, and the formulation of a theoretical model (2013). The researcher then will present the theoretical model as a figure, and this model will consist of three phases that the impact brings on their campus lives, i.e., affectation, adjustment, and strategic response. The researcher will advance categories within each of these phases, and also will specify the context, and the conditions influencing the categories of each three phase (2013). The researcher then will take one of the conditions, high extent of activism on the failed university affairs, and will elaborate on these possibilities in a figure of the taxonomy of ways to high extent of activism. This elaboration will enable the researcher to draw specific results for affectation, adjustment and strategic response. In conclusion, this grounded theory study will advance important lessons for future efforts at campus activism for affectation, adjustment and strategic response (Lombardi, 2013). This study could be classed as the grounded theory research with many defining features being present in the research design (Creswell, 2013).  Its central focus is to understand a behavior process, and the theoretical model advances three major phases in this process.  A theory emerges to suggest the framework of evolution on the affectation, adjustment, and strategic response for the departmental and campus faculty members in the study.  The researcher did not specifically mention memoing or writing down their ideas as they interview the faculty members and analyze the data.  The form of data collection is consistent with many grounded theory studies; the collection of face-to face interview data. I also collect focus group data with the participants in the study.  The researcher engages in a structured approach to grounded theory data analysis using the Strauss and Corbin approach of coding categories and developing a theoretical model that includes context and conditions. I do not follow the strict Strauss and Corbin components of open, axial, and selective coding. I do provide a detailed description of the phases of the theoretical model and compare their model with existing theoretical models in the literature. (k) A Tentative Research on the Ethnographic Approach The study will employ the ethnographic approach, which describes the core values, behaviors, and beliefs of campus faculty members for the failed recruitment process of their peers (Creswell, 2013). The arousal from the incident is related with their values, behaviors, and beliefs as a culture sharing group. The faculty members often are the group that holds the values and beliefs on clean living ideology and sanctity of educational professionalism, and exercise their best judgment to behave on this philosophy. As a study that re-conceptualize their aftermath from the impact of failed recruitment process, this ethnography will examine how this cultural group expresses their values and beliefs and behaves accordingly as a reaction to such specific failure and against the ambiguous culture of university faculty generally. The researcher will use ethnographic methods of data collection, including participating in the event of arousal and attending the proceedings of disciplinary board, and faculty sorority (2013). He will interview more than 25 professors, and gathering documents from sources, such as newspaper stories, university communication, and public documents. The description also will convey the curious blend of expressing personal values, academic fundamentalism and progressive influences of expressing personal values (Lombardi, 2013). The researcher then will develop five themes: living in a clean and ethical way; recognition and knowledge of campus governance and its democratization; cure and sociable departmental and campus environment; enhancement of professional performance; promoting the developed, open, and fair competition in the recruitment process (Creswell, 2013). The article will conclude with a broad positioning of the faculty values, behaviors, and beliefs from the failed recruitment process of their peers. In sum, response of departmental and campus faculty in this case likely will be found to be multilayered, contradictory, and personally and socially different. The study will illustrate a scope of traits normally present in the ethnographic studies (2013).  The ethnography is the study of a culture-sharing group and its members' core values and beliefs.  The researcher will first describe the group in terms of its members' ideas, then advance five themes about the behavior of the group, and end with a broad level of abstraction beyond the themes to suggest how the specific incident works. This group is interacting through their professional lives and develops ways of behaving.  Similarly with the critical ethnography, the researcher will use a theory of resistance to opposition in describing the confrontation of concerned group of professors, and discuss the relations with the dominant culture in a complex and multilayered way. Given the lengthy and extensive anchor of dissension and disagreement, their behavior may be talked over the personal and social transforming qualities of participating in the culture sharing group. The study will include a call for social transformation.  The researcher positions himself by describing his involvement in the process and his role as a participating observer of the group for two years. He also engages in fieldwork by conducing unstructured in-depth interviews.  From these emic data and the researcher's field notes, the etic data, a cultural interpretation is formed as to how the group behaves. The members interested in and concerned of failed process construct both individualized and collective meanings for their participation. Their affectation and knowledge occur at different levels, and their response would be personal, social and political. We leave this study with a complex view of how they survive to know as a culture sharing group with adjustment and adaptation. (l) A Tentative Research on the Case Study This qualitative study employs a case method and describes a response of CU faculty to the failed recruitment process in which one job applicant was unreasonably or allegedly schematically rejected despite his good qualification. The case study begins with a detailed description of the failed process, chronicled over two years, and provides details about the campus and faculty society of CU (Creswell, 2013). Data will be collected through the multiple sources of information, such as interviews, observations, documents, audiovisual materials, and they will be advanced in a table summarizing the forms of data. I will interview an applicant, now assistant professor within the department of military science and more than 15 interested and concerned faculty members. The scope of interviewees had been approved of the petition to the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects Research. From the data analysis emerged themes of ethical arousal, affectation to professional dignity, adjustment, retriggering, and reform planning of recruitment process. Toward the end of research product, the researcher combines these narrower themes into two overarching perspectives, an organizational and a social-psychological response, and relates these to the literature, thus providing layers of analysis in the study and invoking broader interpretations of the meaning of the case (2013). The research will end with a suggestion for adjustment, development and reform to the failed process as to correspond with the key questions presented in the beginning. In this case study, the paradigm structured within four phases -the problem, context, issues and lessons learned – by Lincoln and Cuba's will be followed (2013). The research also will add my own personal perspective by presenting information about the extent of data collection and the questions necessary to be addressed in adjustment, development and reform. The epilogue at the end of the study reflexively will bring my personal experiences into discussion without disrupting the flow of the study. For the purpose of improving personal, social existence and professional performance, we advance practical and useful implications of the study for personnel on campuses. We can find several defining features of case study (2013).  We identify the case for the study, the entire faculty of CU and their response to a potentially failed recruitment process of their peers. The case is a bounded system, bounded by time and place.  The intent of researcher is to report a single, instrumental case study so that he is most interested in exploring the issue of failed recruitment process and suing the single case of one institution to illustrate the response of faculty to the failed process.  The researcher uses extensive, multiple sources of information in data collection to provide the detailed in-depth understanding of the faculty response. It also is chronological over two-year period of time. In order to document and convince readers of the in-depth picture purported to build, the table of data collection will be advanced. Since it had already happened and is an undesirable event, it should not be an intrinsic case study.  A considerable time will be spent dealing with the data analysis, and the context or setting for the case will be described. The study situates the case within the hometown of Korean democracy, a democratic campus with detailed events and stories during the two-year period of time. The researcher advances five themes that help to understand the case, which will be presented not in order of chronology for their importance and characteristic as essences as well as natural fundaments of inseparability.  The research ends with presenting assertions in terms of two overriding responses of the faculty community to the failed recruitment process, i.e., organizational and psychological or social-psychological. I further relate my assertions with the current literature that also dealt with the types of two responses. This relational reflection will provide the audience with a sense and overall understanding of the specific case because of larger explanation for our descriptive and thematic analyses.

Qualitative research and evaluation methods (3rd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc. Chapter IV Qualitative Research, Philosophy and Frameworks A. Theoretical and Conceptual Frameworks (a) A Leading Comment The philosophy and frameworks are crucial in studying the social science since the researcher is an agent, not a discoverer, who is neither absolutely intact nor prototypical and innate to approach, interpret, analyze, constructive and should be consistent and integral through the end of research (Patton, 2002). He himself is one of social constituents, and learned being (Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, Roche, 2001). Two points are remarked (i) the issue of philosophy and frameworks generally influence or govern, in many senses, not only part of research -such as literature review and headfirst discussion on the independent section of philosophical assumptions or interpretive frameworks -but the whole of research process, say, data collection, analysis, discussion and suggestions (ii) the philosophy as a lens for the scholarly taste would not only be variable objectively, but also possibly change subjectively with the career development of individual researcher (iii) the claims of grounded theory research would take a researcher more seriously that generally desires of him as one active participant and that is expected of no bias or predisposition from the standing mainstream of knowledge (Creswell, 2013). For example, we can consider the first point relating with the data collection. The feminist or disability researchers may prefer a photo or audiovisual materials to make their assertion more concrete. The pragmatist may prefer the case study to solve a practical solution for the bounded system. The post-positivism user will be more oriented to the documentary examination, for example, as related with the legal research, than other approach of data collection since the elements would be reductionistic, logical, empirical, cause and effect-oriented and deterministic on a priori theories. On the second aspect, I may illustrate between the juridical scientists and jurists. Within the system of law school, the doctoral degree on juridical science is a highest degree that the JD degree holders will study after his graduation. We say, therefore, a graduate or research degree in law for the students who study within those programs, LL.M and SJD. Both degree holders conduct a legal research. The frameworks or philosophy may keenly be related each other on one hand since they treat the law or legal subject commonly, but little differs from other aspect. The statistical data and interdisciplinary perspectives are more demanded of such higher degree, and the style of research product may apparently be discriminating in cases. The diverse lens can be employed and encouraged to employ by the supervisors, ironically normally professors with the JD degree. A later development of law faculty in his career path may breed them to be interdisciplinary and diverse in terms of scholarly lens, but vastly unlikely in reality, which implies that the LLM and SJD are principally a foreign purported degree by teaching the basic of American concept of law, expecting the art and science intelligence than professional education as comingled with the basic legal knowledge, and finally seeing them to become a professor in their home countries. In other cases, the growth of scholarly career would often allow a wider and open or interdisciplinary perspective in dealing with the philosophies and interpretive frameworks (Gardner, 2011). (b) One Article and Thought on the Frame Reading the article, the feel is that the author seems likely an enologist who indulges in wine as a clinician on psychotherapy on one hand, and the researcher of virology to surf onto the vast data. The kind of research dealing with big data seems an emerging and exciting way of research these days due to the rising profile of electronic data storage. Today, the Joong-Ang Daily reported a most popular expression of Koreans about \"love,\" hence, socalled key word considered to be importantly related with the qualitative investigation. It collected data within such lengthy time span beginning from 2008 through the first of 2015. The research findings are stimulating, for example, what words are most popularly combined with love. Mom is first, family next, and friend third and girl or boy fourth, and so with each share being specified. The research seems a mixed project so that the duration of love also was studied according to the relationships, i.e., parent-child, hus and wife, friends, boys and girls, and so. This type of research shows that the current environment for qualitative researchers is both encouraging and challenging. On the article in this week, the research explored almost 1,000 texts and required five years of pilot study (Clarkson, 1996). The data to support his research findings are enormous to encompass poetry, personal experience, many textual extracts of theory or therapeutic dialogue, other research reports, theoretical considerations, clinical reflections, syllabus constructions. In his view, the data collection is the kind of post modern assemblage which was claimed coherent, valid, and reliable. His research goals were implied that (i) he provides the framework for at least one-four year psychotherapy training course (ii) an independent psychology accreditation process (1996). As guided, the philosophies and frame generally determine the whole of research project so that it is holistic and omnipresent dealing with the substance of information and discovered facts. It provides a lens to wheel ahead over the entire research process where the issues or ambiguities arising from the process are conceded or resolved through the lens (Laureate Education, 2010f). The frame of author can be considered to pertain with many perspectives of Creswell (2013). Actually on every corner of pages can we encounter his brief on the frames and philosophies. For example, he said that the pragmatic distinctness of collected data is a prime framework dealing with the interpretation and analysis. This seems from the characteristic of his research, i.e., immensely concerned of qualitative nature of humanity and even psychotherapeutic studies. His pragmatism may infuse an idea to critique a complacency of researchers. While invoking Kvale's suggestion, he made a focus, \"by discarding a modern legitimation mania, justification of knowledge is replaced by application with a pragmatic concept of validity (Clarkson, 1996).\" The methodological assumptions for the qualitative research are obvious to deal with his inductive and bottom-up ground. The social constructivism seems to underlie his framework in which he emphasized the lived or work experience from individuals. The author himself had been an individual with the work experience which constitutes a fundament of this research, and the client provides a lived experience to shape his position as a clinician. His immense disposition to the frame and philosophy also can be enchanted in his comment itself, \"All qualitative researchers are philosophers,\" by citing Bateson, \"universal sense in which all human begins....are gifted by highly abstract principles\" (1996). On this remark, we may share if the degree name, PhD or Doctor of Philosophy would have some sense to indicate the character or destination of this degree holder, normally researcher of social science.\" He also mentioned on the poststructuralism which suggests two important things to qualitative writers. Given the wide hint on his frames and philosophies influential over his research, I may brief on two frames. First, the transformative framework seems to inform his research that he charted vast data over period and was enthusiastic to argue on the inseparable relationships between the psychotherapeutic research and practice. This perspective often focuses on the marginalized individuals or groups rather than imposing structural laws and theories. Although the clinicians may not be such discrete group within the circle of clinical psychology, it was taken to be challenged by the author from the mainstream of knowledge since their belief, value and knowledge are highly individualized or particular. In the introduction, it seems conceded, \"as a practitioner myself, it occurred to me that perhaps one of the reasons psychotherapy research is often ambiguous and inconclusive is that it was trying to model itself on the quantitative investigatory paradigms of the physical sciences (1996).\" In this framework, the basic tenet is that knowledge is not neutral and it reflects the power and social relationships within society. This lens seems to highly influence the author's attitude through the article standing between the subjective knowledge on therapeutic practice and quantification-oriented general knowledge from the therapeutic research. For example, he introduced his methodology, \"The use of my own personal and professional experience as client, teacher and supervisor of psychotherapists as locus of exploration... (1996).\" Second, the author partly employed the post-modernist frame as explicit in his statement, \"to explore a postmodern qualitative research methodology, context and content which was grounded in a moral universe where issues of values, ethics .... (1996).\" According to Thomas, the postmodernist are \"armchair radicals\" who focus on changing ways of thinking than calling for action based on these changes (Creswell, 2013). This can make as distinct from the transformative framework where the latter goes far enough in advocating action to help individuals. This aspect of frame is fairly penetrating through the article, but eclectic by relating the effect and utility through the theory, supervision and practice. This is so even while he placed the heart of study with the felicitous phrase, the therapeutic relationships- the focus for the case under investigation in the instance. He also seems to be influenced from the post modern way of thinking, as we read in the Discourse analysis, \"First, there was the thorough exploration of the diversity of meaning, the different contradictory ways of speaking that govern what we do (1996).\" He also was expressly iterative of his position, by commenting, \"I would submit that this study has not only been post-modern in the diversity and particularities of its components drawing from a multiplicity.....\" His main suggestion on the enduring and reinforced ties between the research and practice had been stressed in a sense of diversity within the universe. In his belief, the client is a major source of new or confirmable knowledge \"Learning with the client in such a way introduces a praxis of the recovery of knowledge which is surely at the very heart of the therapeutic endeavor itself (1996).\" (c) An Insight As commented, the essence of research would lead to an extended employment of philosophies and use of framework. Given its research design on the textual or documentbased investigation, this aspect might become more inevitable to support his position and argument. However, it possibly could cause the loss of focus and confusion of audience how much we could discern his position and the existing discourse from the psychotherapeutic research. It seems that we can see a farthest example of qualitative trait in terms of research method. That is because the author seems to be omnipresent and looks like the kind of whale in the sea of documentary data examined over a period of several years. He seems immersed into the theme he works on, and his individual is surely an important participant witnessing the intelligent circle of clinical psychology. His research goal seems to emphasize the long interplay of both professions, i.e., researchers and clinicians, as well as continued relevance to collaborate. The theme is sufficiently proven from his empirical evidence, i.e., very new type of research design as introduced earlier. The framework is interesting and seems authoritative by exemplifying the philosophical assumptions through pages. Nevertheless, I may conceive if the quantitative approach also may come clearer or at least complementary, for example, via the exhaustive search of share or proportionality among the research products in his field by asking whether the basis of them arises from the clinical experience or arises purely from theoretical deals (Creswell, 2009). If a major number of papers are based on the clinical experience, then his theme could be persuaded at considerable extent. B. Role of Theory and Qualitative Research (a) The Role of Philosophy Philosophy is important since (i) it shapes how we formulate our problem and research questions to study and how we seek information to answer the question (i) it is deeply rooted in our training and reinforced by the scholarly community (iii) reviewers make philosophical assumptions about a study when they evaluate it (Creswell, 2013). The philosophical assumptions are called in other way depending on the user, for example, paradigms, epistemologies, ontology, broadly conceived research methodologies, and alternative knowledge claims (Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, Roche, 2001). Creswell proposed four philosophical assumptions patterned over qualitative researchers (i) ontological issue (ii) epistemological assumption (iii) axiological assumption, (iv) methodological (Creswell, 2013). Within the ontological issue, the researcher is concerned of the nature of reality and its characteristics, and approach within the dimension, the kind between \"right and wrong,\" \"desirable and undesirable\" \"acceptable and unacceptable\" and so on. It therefore presupposes multiple realities received in different perspective among the social group. The legal researcher and pundits or analysts of politic and social issues often and most notably would be framed in this assumption. Within the epistemological assumption, the field level emerges as a major concern that researchers try to get close as possible to the participants being studied (2013). It is critical to know based on the firsthand information to minimize the distance or objective separateness. It is, therefore, related with the complete – not partly of data collection although most salient in that stage -process of qualitative research and defines the verifiability and quality of research. It is more practical and operational concept than the ontological issue. The axiological assumption requires the qualitative research as value-laden nature of study where the researcher likely position themselves in the study as one of participant. As said, the bias and predisposition have both a service and disservice to allow the social science to be distinguished from the natural science. The researcher's presence is apparent according to an interpretive biography. The final assumption comes on its methodology as inductive and emerging that the researcher's experience in collecting and analyzing the data is elementary and characteristic with the grounded-up logic (2013). (b) The Five Qualitative Approaches and Role of Theory Qualitative researchers use theory in their studies in several ways. First, they can structure their research at the same extent and style with the quantitative paradigm, in which the variables, constructs, and hypotheses are extensive and statistically perfect to seize the whole of theory (2013). This allows the quantitative studies to claim more than validity and credibility of their research findings, normally purported to describe the general population. In the qualitative studies, it is possible that the use of theory could be similar with the counterpart, but might impose a heavy burden in framing the research plan. For the positivist research, therefore, the statistical feasibility traditionally calls to restrict the number of variables contained in their models. This way of use, in any way, has a pertinence in qualitative approaches and according to trait of disciplines. For example, cultural themes or aspects of culture taken by the ethnographers as their research topic can begin with the hypotheses to be tested from the literature (Wilson & Chaddha, 2010). Second, as stated, the theory in qualitative studies lends a lens for the researcher to orient his themes. It takes an advocacy tone and aura in cases, and the kind of issues encompassing the race, gender, and social class would be more probable in this use (Creswell, 2013). This can be in comparison with the kind of other issues in subtlety, i.e., social control, language, stability and change, or social organization often explored by ethnography when the first way of use is employed. The second nature of role was advanced around 1980's, and theory in the research work is viewed more in emphasis as something to guide on the importance of issues and people that needs to be studied. The transformation in use of theory also affected that the researcher himself or herself is not a dispassionate-objective and neutral in good sense of assumption -reporter of science, but crucial agent as to the position for the nature and quality of research work. It also tends to govern the written accounts of research findings, what we may see as assertions or suggestions, social activism, critical race theory and critical ethnography theory. Third, the theory in the qualitative studies can play as the end point as we often encounter the grounded theory framework, in which it prescribes a strict inductive way of generating categories from empirical data in its orthodox form (Creswell, 2013). Since it includes the capacity for a detailed study of a micro issue of a larger reality within a particular setting, it processes broad themes to a generalized model or theory. In this way of use, the researcher begins by gathering detailed information from participants, and then forms this information into categories or themes, and develops them into patterns -for example, propositional generalization and naturalistic generalization. As Neuman stated, \"Pattern theory does not emphasize logical deductive reasoning.\" While this type of qualitative research requires a generative methodology and often is of inductive nature, the researcher would cope with more complex data and dealing with a complex array of variables than traditional positivist models. Fourth, the theory may only be implicit and no explicit framework can properly play or be identified in the qualitative theories (2013). For example, in many studies of phenomenology, a rich and detailed description of a central phenomenon could be made with the essence of experience from participants, but as hardly to be mentioned of any explicit theory employed (McPhail, 1995). This does not negate the thesis that the inquirer is neither innate nor perfectly objective with his work. In other words, no qualitative study begins from pure observation. Since the researcher, at least, would be an agent of concept, the non-use of theory does not say that even the concept or conceptual framework would not be employed. Between the conceptual and theoretical frameworks, the concept would base other than theory, which eventually comprises of theory. Figure 1 Research Tips in Use of Theory (From Creswell) (c) Some Note on the Narrative Research and Case Studies While the role of theory has been implicit in the above explanation, let me get a little further on the respective approach. The narrative production in the therapist's case relies on the theoretical orientation. The study by Moreira and Goncalves explored the influence of the therapist's theoretical orientation on patient's narrative production (Moreira & Goncalves, 2010). This evinces that the narrative research can be more productive and efficient depending on the theory with which the researcher or clinical therapist had been framed. The two authors took four samples of therapists and client, named Rogers, Lazarus, Shostrom and Cathy. The three of them are therapists and Cathy's therapeutic narratives with them were analyzed in three narrative dimensions – structural coherence, process complexity and content multiplicity (2010). Results showed statistically significant differences in scores of Cathy's total narrative production depending on the therapist she was interacting with. The narrative study has a trait of and deeply rooted in the psychological function of humanity and language processes. The concept of narrative is being increasingly acknowledged as a way to develop a more integrated understanding of human psychology (2010). It, in fact, emerged as a transIdentify the Role of Theory : Up-front explanation, an End Point or Advocacy Lens Adequate Location and Consistence in Use Decide if theory is to be used or not theoretical concept with diverse theoretical orientations dealing with new quest of knowledge on psychodynamic, experiential and cognitive and familial matters. Upon a surfeit of research paper on the relationship among the theoretical orientation of therapists and narratives, new knowledge in these areas proves much on the role of theory and its production. For example, studies showed that patient's narrative change during psychotherapy is related with therapeutic outcomes while other studies on the language processes have focused on the role of the verbal response modes in the therapeutic process (2010). Rogers held the theory of client-centered therapy that every human being has the potential for self-actualization, as well as the conditions for self-actualization are provided. The aim of client-centered therapy is to promote these conditions in the client. Lazarus had a firm orientation in theory and assumption that human beings are the product of a complex interplay of genetic, social, learning, physical factors and history (2010). We may call it the multimodal therapy. His assumption, therefore, leads that both personality and psychological disturbances are products of the dynamic relations between multiple factors. The actualizing therapy, as held to frame his assumption and ways to practice psychotherapy, is seen as a therapeutic approach that is assumed by Shoestrom, a founder of this theory, as being an integrating approach, integration contributions from different therapeutic models (2010). In the theory and method, therefore, it is flexible and adaptable to concretize his or her natural tendency, what we may refer to actualization. A trust among humans is considered most precious and important where the psychotherapy process consists in promoting individual's actualization process. This means that the therapeutic process goal is to help the patient in replacing survival tactics with actualizing growth responses (2010). Although these three theories developed within the domain of psychology and psychotherapy, it provides a foundational thought on the role of theory in the narrative research. For example, narrative researchers collect stories from individuals and co-constructed between themselves and the participant. Then, the narrative can be constructed toward the actualizing growth version (2010). In the narrative studies, the individual experiences are pivotal which are, however, shrouded with the identities of individuals. Hence, the theory in this approach is critical to question, \"What are the human elements?\" That is true even if we may have much more theories in thinking of the framework of narrative research – for example, charismatic leadership in the studies of business management or social stratification theory of class research. The virtual answer can be found in three of theoretical assumptions in the psychology and psychotherapy. As reviewed, case studies differs from other approaches in that they were intensive descriptions and analysis of a single unit or bounded system, such as single organization, program, event, group, or community. The case studies may trace to ideographic or interpretive as their origin which refers to a study of individuals while nomothetic, interchangeably normative in the current use of word, referred to a search for general laws (Laws & McLeod, 2015). The normative model was based on the idea that the human behavior was essentially rule governed --hence more social or natural to rely on the quantitative method or positivist theory. The interpretive paradigm is more friendly with the qualitative method with a concern for the individual and describes or explains human behavior in their own way. The case studies have several ways in terms of its nature and scope of investigation --exploratory, descriptive, and explanatory and single case study or multiple case study (2015). Given its nature, the interpretive paradigm or four philosophical assumptions will undergird the process of research and the area of specific interest may be provided with theories of discipline in dealing with the ethnographic case study, historical case study, legal case study, psychological or sociological case study, i.e., a meso or mega framework in combination to structure or design and operate the research project. Within the descriptive and explanatory case studies, the existing theory can inspire the research or penetrate its process so that the people and unit to be studied may be referred to and types and extent or analysis of data will be conducted accordingly. The exploratory research would be less reliant on the existing theory for its nature. However, it can be claimed as in Yin that the case study may be less scientific or less rigorous on the theoretical framework implying a relatively little role of theory in this approach. Yin acknowledged in subtlety and with defense, \"case study researchers had possibly been sloppy in the past and had allowed biased views to influence conclusions.....\" (2015). The drawback of case study also is claimed for the consumption of time and massive documentation, but the proponents on the strengths of this approach are not rare. Yin suggested that the case study has a distinct advantage for \"how\" and \"why\" questions, and Bromley claimed, \"the case studies got as close to the subject partly by means of direct observation in natural settings....\" (2015). The uniqueness of case study has been adulated by Abrahamson, \"since such data are rare, they can help elucidate the upper and lower boundaries of experience. Second, such data can facilitate...prediction by documenting infrequent non-obvious, or counter intuitive occurrences that may be missed by standard statistical approaches......\" (2015). Generally, the theory would not be an ending point in use unlike the grounded theory research since the end result of a case study draws some or all of the following : (i) the nature of the case itself (ii) the historical background of the case (iii) the physical setting in which the case is bounded (iv) other contexts, such as economic, political and legal, that impact upon the case (v) other cases through which the case is recognized (vi) those information through which the case can be known (2015). (d) The Research on Nomad Professors As previously discussed, my research questions would comprise two central questions and eight sub-questions and can be most salient of the characteristic of case studies. Figure 2 The Characteristics and Research on the Nomad Professors Characteristics Narrative Research Phenomenology Grounded Theory Ethnography Case Study Focus O O O Type of Problem Best Suited for Design O O Discipline Background O O Unit of Analysis O O O O Data Collection Form O O Data Analysis Strategies O O Written Report O O The role of theory in researching the nomad professors for the local university of Korea seems to be conceived from the general purview and those concerned between the case studies and theoretical framework. From the above explanation, therefore, I can present a concept map to elucidate the role of theory ---including four philosophical assumptions, various interpretive frameworks, concerning the qualitative research or case studies of nomad professors as follows. Figure 3 Philosophical Assumptions and Research on the Nomad Professors Figure 4 Interpretive Frameworks and Research on the Nomad Professors •What is the nature of reality? • (i) identities of nomad professors • (ii) their role as teacher and researcher • (iii) their personal, social and professional mode of lives Ontological • What counts as knowledge?

It is contributive, not redundant, arousing the researcher to be creative and original although the contribution may be like a particle for the seashore sand. In some cases, however, the contribution could be the kind of Copernicus-impact leading to the sea change of existing awareness, such as discovery of electricity, Hick's discovery, Aesop's Apple, labor perspective on Marxism, Darwinism, and post-modern paradigm of thinking (Patton, 2002). The principal work of natural scientist is a discovery, which would be factual and triggered at tangible object. That would not be applicable to the social scientists so that they should be an agent to \"interpret\" the events, occurrences, and social phenomenon (Creswell, 2009). The term \"interpret\" is a prelude of process within the mind of researcher, which can be played out through a higher level of process, what we call \"construct.\" In this context, the post-constructivism is one of most eminent philosophical assumptions that the researcher employ to explore his qualitative theme. The philosophical assumptions, therefore, are foundational for the social science research because (i) it networks the field work or information culled through the research operation with the basic of human thought (ii) it is principally concerned of humanity and social science than natural science although the human conscience and ethics occasionally raised in the world of natural science-such as research of atomic bomb, stem cells and its application on human body, and standard of animal protection -would stem from the philosophy (iii) it provides an interpretive framework orienteering the research project as the kind of omniscient element- hence, it often would be the kind of lens characterizing the nature of research product (iv) it is an influence most toned through the whole of research process, but less specific as to slide into lower levels, what we may consider as theory and concept-hence, macro, meso, micro strands to be minded with the researcher (v) the originality would arise vastly from information gathering, but could only be considered a scholarly work that has to be structured within the philosophical assumptions, theory and concept-hence what may be said of framework to characterize the research books and articles (vi) \"originality of natural science\" is unitary since the researcher is not an agent or wigged with lens-unitary source of • The study has been inspired by the above interpretive frameworks and influenced by philosophical assumptions • It will be performed witin the frame of inductive inquiries and bottom-up ground on the intact cultural group, nomad professors of CU. • No extensive deals with variables and hypotheses are expected at current stage. Are Variables or Hypotheses are Extensive as the Quantative Studies ? • Many theories guide the importance of nomad professors and their issues • the researcher himself is a crucial agent to deal with the issue, not a dispassionate and objective observer. • The theory tends to govern the written accounts of research findings on the nomad professors • The research on nomad professors will take the tone of advocacy and aura of distinct cultural group The Second Role of Theory* • In terms of mega level, the philosphies and interpretive inspire my research and undergird the whole of reearch process • In the meso or micro level, the studies on nomad professor might be explortory in nature that the the role of theory could be little. Explortaory Case Studies • At this statge, it will be unlikely to generate a theory on the nomad professors as a whole of general population. • Instead, the end result of a case study draw some or all of the following : (i) the nature of the case itself ( ii) the historical background of the cae (iii) the physical setting in which the case is bounded (iv) other c ontexts, such as economic, political and legal, that impact upon the case (v) other cases through which th e case is recognized (vi) those information through which the case can be known. Theory as ending point originality with commonness of researcher, while originality of social science is twofold since the new information and different philosophical assumptions can lead to a different knowledge – \"mixed source of originality.\" The issue of philosophical assumptions or interpretive frameworks is fairly consequential so as to structure the style of research in an incurable and embedded fashion within a special blob of intellectual circles (Creswell, 2013). For example, the approach of Korean legal scholars in dealing with their research question is very usual from the theories or principles of western legal culture, such as Germany, England, France, and US, while their research problem will be discussed in the next chapters on the cases and propositions or theories of domestic circle of scholars. The legal scholars of US would normally not be entailed with this leading role of foreign sources, but rather begins with the problematic case or cases rendered by the Supreme Court. The dealings of Korean scholars in this case may be compatible, in terms of research style or structure, with the scope of qualitative researchers on apparent exposure of philosophical assumptions provided if the dealings of US legal scholars may be more reality-oriented with a specific case or problems of legal intelligence (Gardner, 2011). In other words, while the philosophical assumptions are any more pioneering in the Korean case, the US case concerning the legal research is more likely \"problem-oriented\" than \"framework-oriented.\" Of course, the identification of problem itself may be determined –or at least shaped in different way-by the philosophical assumption of researcher as an agent, but the forms of dealing, what I may term \"research style,\" obvious differs over the pieces of legal research in tow countries. My point in this case is several; (i) As Creswell implied, the role of philosophy or debate on the interpretive frameworks are not exhaustive, but depends on the circumstances and conditions (ii) the discourse of the philosophical assumptions and interpretive frameworks itself is concerned of apparent reality within the research society and their power and influence within the circle of intelligence – perhaps only measured by the amount of work products (iii) the grab of this issue, in terms of methodology, nevertheless can be seen as stranded to characterize the humanity and society. On those points in concern, I may illustrate mine and Creswell's. Creswell had articulated major interpretive frameworks, which includes post-positivism, social constructivism, transformative frameworks, postmodern perspectives, pragmatism, feminist theories, critical theory and critical race theory, queer theory, and disability theories (2013). This classification is very history-based and persuasive, but the insight is if they could be complement with my viewpoint. In the first, it might not be encompassing or could be complemented with the country or region based reality. Korean and American ways of legal research can be a stark point to address the issue of interpretive frameworks. The Asia has a reach-out in various fields, AIIA bank, world first economies in terms of GDP and per capita asset, and G2 is a usual lens to look into the politics of world hegemony. The USTR, one of most powerful trade agencies in the US and world, manages two branches dealing with the geographical terms and framework-based assignment of responsibility. To say, the bureaus of Europe and Asia or Africa would be a first form of agency and bureaus of trade of goods, bureau of trade of services, bureau of intellectual property would pertain with the second method. They are combined to structure the USTR, and the first form generally would be noted as more powerful. It may be discussed at this stage of world progress if we consider Sino Framework, Japan-Korean Philosophical Assumptions on the Social Science Research and Latino or Canadian Framework. Now it may be talked about differences, if not determinative, among the countries of European continent, US and England in thoughts and philosophies. The point is that the framework is a soft concept, and can be pluralistic in many standards. In the second, the Creswell's proposition on major frameworks is reality-oriented, which draws upon the attitudes of research society. It is hinted that we can well imagine of popularity of such research themes, to say, feminist studies, a greater amount of research work on disability issue, surging concern and consequential rise of research society on the race issues and so on. These issues would not be an interest of century earlier scholars, which proves the share of researchers and productive number of their work are a major reason to give their status as a mainstream of frameworks. In the third, the strand beyond the quantity of research interest is also a factor so that we can see fundaments of humans and society in the terms, such as female, disability and race. A half of population in the society would be female that provides a strand for the frameworks. The disabled and minority race are a critical component of our society, and the surfeit of knowledge generated for the ruling class may saturate to disinterest the excavators of original knowledge (Laureate Education, Inc. 2010f). Between the philosophy and reality as granted, we often consider the philosophy immutable and everlasting, but we can find it transformative or trending in the discourse of Creswell --one directly from the word itself, \"post\"-modernism or \"post\"-positivism, and the other indirectly from the \"transformative\" framework Reference Clarkson, P.

A Quality of Observation as a Data Source Observations are one form of data used to support the qualitative theme. Some thought on its strengths and limitations arises. First, the observations are stranded with two crucial qualities of human intelligence. The logos and pathos, as we see, comprise the human agent to have an awareness and appreciation relating with the universe. The five senses of human are not separable from the true and authentic knowledge, say, sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. Second, the observations could be more powerful to transform the knowledge and awareness of our society in terms of data sources. Although they are converted into a lingual form if not presented as photo evidence, it could more readily be traced by the future researcher and provides a check point for them, policy makers and other concerned intellectuals. Third, the observations would be more helpful to make a focus on the controversy or differing views. It provides an impression and could change an easy settlement of existing knowledge. Let me take an example from my experience that it has strength to clarify the controversies most readily and explicitly. Korea is divided between the South and North according to their ideological dissidence and post-war international politics in 1945. The two brother states likely had raced in the competition of national development that the propaganda and public relations had poured to inculcate their superiority. The right circle of Southern developmentalists actually in such long period of reign through the current had been suspicious of leftist ideas within the intelligent group of society, and constantly vigil of their ideological problems. That is because they sometimes contend to argue in the favor of northern communists which troubled the KCIA. KCIA and Korean studies association had schemed to publicize the superiority of liberal constitutionalism practiced in South Korea in any impressive way. They collected the photos of both states to contrast the stark disparity of economic conditions around 1970's. That persuades most of public and the leftist intellectuals had been submissive to lower their tone of intellectual work. The photos in this case would outflank any sophisticated articles or books in terms of evidentiary convincement. Fourth, it has strength that the researcher would not encounter the difficulties and challenges often arising from the interview, such as resilience and turfs of interviewees or affronts from target groups. Fifth, the primacy of observations as a data form would depend on the research design and types of qualitative research (Creswell, 2013). It is truly a service for the qualitative researchers. In the quantitative studies, the observations are only a priori effect if any, which underlies within the assumption and predisposition of researchers. For example, the stage of research design would infuse various considerations into the mind and purpose of quantitative researchers, which depends consciously or unconsciously on their experiences, perhaps not insulated from their routine observations. The exchange of scholars or policy makers had a rich history and also is practiced even in this contemporary age. US scholars of public policy or ethnic studies may wish to collaborate with Korean or African peers for various reasons. He may be a more competent statistician to facile address the challenges of SPSS issue or data analysis. He simply could be more efficiently to gather the information from a distinct locality (Angrosino, 2006). One other reason possibly would be his long residence plus innate body and mind of local culture, probably formed from observations. Then the US scholar could seek an aid and may write the research article as a lead author. One of my favorite is to watch the aired lecture from Korean Open University. Yesterday, one female professor delivered a useful class to instruct the mainstream of western views on the world. He began with the work of Edward Said on Orientalism, to the Rostow's view of developmental paradigm under the western exploitation, to the theory of center-periphery authored by Amin, and finally through the view of world system marshaled by Wallerstein. For the college students of Korea and Asian nations, her lecture is fairly articulate to convey a compendium of world views in terms to deal with various disciplines of social science. The experience of one hour in front of TV has made be reminiscent, as simply from the political hegemony that the western view is dominant and unilateral to author not only theirs, but also Oriental people. I rather say oriental people than states given their imperialistic veil of ignorance with the mightier weapons and arms. The work products she introduced will be mild than econo-political reality, for example, capitulation in the exploitive age, but still rigid to center on the tone of western superiority in my basic knowledge. As time passes, I realized on the lesson of qualitative teachers about the importance of note taking or recordation of information as well as the utility of journal writing (Dewalt & Dewalt, 2010). I revisited through the internet search about the names introduced by the lecturer based on the jotting during the class. I could find the information missed from the lecture to see the network and scholarly interchange between Samir Amin and Immanuel Wallerstein (1989; 2004). It actually was a nexus to understand the lecture, the kind of nodes now we chance on the NVivo exercise. Without the jotting, I certainly lost to point to the rotund nature of deals within the grand view (2010). My fidget to jot the names and follow up search actually made something striking to get a whole picture of world grand theory. The observations could have strength with a proper recordation and iterative journey through the collected information. The second point in this experience is that the \"oriental observations\" had not a place anywhere. That is because the class title was the western culture and theory. We can see a piece of Oriental views in other names of class dealing with Japan, Korea, and China embarking on the western industrialization and democratic form of rule. That is, however, very different in approach and awareness. The description is passive, exotic, receptive or somewhat discriminatory rather than active, dynamic or exploitative. These points not only illustrate the importance of observations, but also position of observers when we consider the generation of new knowledge in terms of research method. They also show a fundamental role of observations in beginning to function for the intelligence or awareness other than any other data form, such as interviews or public survey. We are known that the philosophy of experientialism is not merely of sensory elements meaning it to be translated into words or description (Hunt, Colander, 2015). In continuum of our example, that may lead to a different pan of human subsistence -oriental and western -beyond the simple differences of perspective. It is, of course, very unfortunate that the researchers had to endeavor to fill the gap. Nevertheless, the diversity within the qualitative research is the kind of value – for example, maximum variation sampling -we cherish that the hypocrisy to neutralize the tension or differences has to be forborne during the course of qualitative process. In my view, the observations also can have limitations as the data source of social science. One is the roles of bias that the results of observations may not be correct or accurate as to the issues of authenticity and objective truths. Simply the color blind people may not correctly appreciate the color of things observed. The position of observers would lead to different description of same site or thing. The scale of viewpoints also could mislead the observers as the maxim implies, \"one cannot see the forest for the tree.\" Recently I have enchanted the tip of interesting contrast between the quantitative and qualitative concepts (Patton, 2002; Creswell, 2009). The Murphy's rule had been illustrated in the class of statistics. The rule states that the worst possibility always happens if it is possible. For example, if the walker prepares an umbrella for the possibly rainy time outside, no rain will always be encountered until he returns home. That points to the fallacy of statistical lives, but the haunted routines from subjective impression. That is because the chance of rain is not perfectly zero, but located between 10-20 percents in terms of probability. The lives, however, feel that he always misses from his expectation when he actually regrets of no need to use the umbrella at specific occasion. This elicits a bias dealing with the subjective impression and quantitative truths, and the human has a distinct element of appreciating the event and occurrences (2002; 2013). One other example had been a commentary of one correspondent for the newspaper concerned of economic impact of MERS-CoV. The Korean economy was reported to decrease because the people apprehended with a fear of contamination would be less in mobility and spend less leading to a reduced growth rate in the upper term of 2015. The analysis is that the fear is merely psychological from the innate nature of human. He argued that the death rate of traffic accident is higher than the infected patients, but the people still drive although they are chilled from the disease. This demonstrates in some sense that the reality of humans and society are not only influenced from the quantitative truths, but also comprised of qualitative elements (Hunt, Colander, 2015). The bias is one source of strengths if the qualitative research is not in the wad of objective truth, but encouraged to raise a voice and awareness of cultural group. That is because the bias can be considered as essential component of human agent as learned, inculcated, compassioned and shuffled with the community or cultural group. Nevertheless, the subjectivities had not to be confused with the fallacy of observations questioning the validity and reliability of scientific research. Therefore, the point has a subtlety in this sense. While the participants other than researcher himself may waddle, he preferably walks straight and competently through the research process irrespective of his status as participant or non-participant. This means the bias stemming from the researcher himself is more problematic to be cautioned although he encourages the subjective state of mind within the pool of participants and even injects his idea in description of observed results. The observed results, hence, need to be backtracked between the bias of researcher and that of observed individuals or sites (Angrosino, 2006). The limitations of observation as a source of data are that it could capture as limited to the outside of events or occurrences. Therefore, its use is not always suited to the individual research design of qualitative research. It depends on the types of qualitative research, and the site or things would be unique of observation since they could not be a source of information collected from interviews. Therefore, the interviews often would complement with the results of observation (2006). As the technology develops, the new source of data gathering seems to become increasing, such as photos and audio-visual materials, the kind of observations, but also poses an interpretive challenge. The limitations also would arise in the context that the indecency and sensationalism, often considered to be cautionary with the scientists, are not to degrade the quality of research products within the standard of humanity and society. (a) The Nonparticipant Observation The nonparticipant observation assignment often is conducted in such public places, i.e., restaurant, coffee shop, shopping mall, book store, zoo, place of worship, museum, health club, funeral parlor, dog park, beach, skating rink, park, movie theater, library, technology center, or any public setting (Janesick, 2011). As we see, observations are one of two major data sources in qualitative study and it normally bases a purposeful sampling as differs from the probability sampling by the quantitative researchers. The sites or persons will be targeted as the research subject or participant, and maximum variation sampling is preferred along the critical cases and convenient cases (Creswell, 2013). In nature, the first sampling approach is most suitable to maximize the differences, which often would be a study focus of qualitative researcher. This quality is distinct underlain in the qualitative study that some standard can be assumed in the narrative research as participant within the three types, i.e., marginal person, ordinary person and great person. The research on gun-shooting case can show this way of approach when the researcher explores the in-presence school teacher as narrator or students close to a victim. The teacher who responds with the scene to suppress or call the police might be great, and the students in the classroom would be marginal while teachers of other buildings might be ordinary. Otherwise, the pragmatic selection will be conducted on a chance encounter, emerge from a wider study or with volunteers (2013). The purpose of nonparticipant observation is to observe, describe, and explain a complex public setting so that the access and rapport are the points of consideration for the researcher, for example, gaining permission to study the site or allowance of data collection. The privacy protection should be resolved in advance, and the benefit may be negotiated for the African enclaves for longitudinal observation. In some cases, the institutional review boards may be required to intervene to supervise and facilitate the process as a matter of law and regulations, where studies involving minors or high risk sensitive populations cases would go a little tougher. It needs to be ensured of natural public access to the setting and multiple viewing opportunities for the researcher (2013). (b) Results and Description of Photo 4 The Meeting Room of ESL Teachers in Alpha University is located at the fifth floor of Global House, 201-342 Seoseok-dong, Dong-gu, Gwang-ju South Korea. The MRET is cute and small and nestled within the thirty stories building among many other shops, restaurants, book stores and dormitory rooms of CU. The Global House had been constructed to meet an ascending number of students who wish to reside within the campus dormitory that the floors over fifth level had been zoned entirely for the rooms of student residents. Below the fifth levels are facilitated for the convenience of students and their basic needs in maintaining their campus lives. In addition to the Thoreau & Walden Bookstore, this large campus building is home to independently owned businesses such as the Cutie Barbershop as well as franchises such as McDonalds, Wendy's, Subway, 7-Eleven, and others. MRET occupies a half of fifth floor in space, and other half for the rest area of interested campus people, however, in the shingle of \"English Only Zone.\" The meeting room is furnished with the letter of indication telling that it is devoted to the exclusive use of ESL teachers in CU. As the number of total teachers here amounts around 15, the space seems not small to saturate their personal, social and professional purpose of meetings. The size of room could accommodate the whole of 15 teachers in my instant guess, and is furnished with five arm chairs and one couch as well as the rectangular table at the middle of rooms attended with five stalls to exchange a talk and views about their various aspect of teacher lives here in CU. They are a distinct group to be compared with the nomad professors of CU since they do not need to travel weekly or in short time interval. They may be a true resident in Gwang-ju, who, however, occasionally needs to return to their home country for vacation. When I visit the meeting room, four ESL teachers have a time to discuss the uniform performance of English teaching as second language and mutually check up with the class design and performance outcome of previous terms. They use the hand-on materials prepared on their own, and the room is furnished with basic necessities for the meeting, such as ballpoint pens, notebooks, key journals, and two PCs. Their origin of country for three participants is US and one teacher from Australia is present at the right edge of picture. On March 21, 2015, I walk into MERT at 2:10 p.m., where I am immediately and graciously greeted by Teacher 2. After a brief conversation with her, I walk over to the other desk sitters, Teacher 1, 3, 4, who are engaging with the talk and discussion, and request their permission to continue my observations. They pause their engagement briefly and say, \"Whatever you need.\" I thank them and walk back to the front of room to the five chairs in the sojourning area. I move the far right chair and place it adjacent to the discussion desk. At 2:25 p.m., a White male in his late 30s, approximately 5 feet 10 inches walk into the room. The man is dressed in a dirty white Florida State T-shirt; light tan, stained, cargo shorts; and white sneakers. A black visor covers his head, with sunglasses perched on top of the visor. Landscapers use these special sunglasses to protect their eyes. His left eye is severely disfigured, with only white space showing. The gentleman's facial hair is light brown and forms a goatee around his lip and chin. A poor complexion with leathery, pockmarked, dirty skin may suggest this person works outside. He talks to the teachers on the desk and suggests in any friendly voice, \"We can plan on the next porcelain work to complete our art product.\" Two teachers grin and say, \"That is really a relaxing time for focus and indulges, which certainly should never be dispensed away.\" Their discussion seems flexible, and five minutes seem to be shared with this new comer. It seems that the White male is instant from the porcelain work site, dropped by their meeting room, and seemingly destined to the shower room located in the second floor of Global House. One Korean student with a junior face appears and hurries with his agenda for the past week assignment by mumbling to Teacher 1, \"Professor I had been late to turn in my report.\" Teacher 1 seems to be resolute on the late policy of assignment, but upon the resilient interchange of talks and reprimand, they seem to compromise in the mid-point of grade. The class-load of ESL teachers is of heavy amount. Twenty to twenty five hours would not be unusual weekly, and they conclude their talks at 3 : 10 to respond with their class schedule. (c) A Brief Evaluation The ESL teachers provide a good point of comparison with the group of nomad professors, often of Korean origin. The place of MERT had been vigorous and dynamic, in which their problem and prospect are exchanged and their personal, social and professional lives are centered. They usually have a residence within and near to campus which is same to the nomad professors. Nevertheless, this kind of public setting is oddly exclusive to the ESL Teachers while the nomad professors are unorganized and individualized to their specific frame of campus lives. B. Example : Observations and Episode (a) A Nomad Professor, Site and Their Lives The public setting for this observation arises from the Alpha University located at Gwang-ju South Korea, and the key places which bear a significance to reproduce the enegery and vigor of nomad professors including Express Bus Terminal, KTX, private residences, campus tennis court. (i) Scene 1 Time and Site : The first two campus scenes had been observed at the crucial day time on class performance, May 20 and May 22, 2015 respectively. Rationale : I had been concerned if the nomad professors actually compose a considerable share among the total professors. The first day of observation is the Wendesday, the mid of week day, and the second day is Friday. Since the observation occurs at the intense time on university lives, the contrast has some implications that the nomad professors migrate weekly for other home, mostly Seoul homes. Although the mixed approach of public survey will complement this question, it could bias for reasons that the observation can comprise the result with the photo evidence.  Episode attached for the first beneath the scene (ii) Scene 2 Time and Site: The next two scenes depicting an inside space of NP residences have been observed over two days, from five oc'clock, May 12 through 3 o'clock, May 13, 2015. Rationale and Evaluation: The local residences are their second home often desolate and coarse as temporal for the week days. Nevertheless, it is their principal place for reinvorgation and repose to respond with their campus duty on teaching and research. The pattern of living and subsistence is less readily gotten uniform although they are same culture-sharing group and internally affected of their ego and identities (Creswell, 2013; Janesick, 2011). That context of differing pattern could be explained from reasons. For example, the male and female professors would be made disctinct that the gender element is one discriminant. The economic conditions likely play as a factor that some professors would prefer a luxurious apartment while poor professors may use a shabby space of small apratmet or even one room facilities. The career years of NPs seem to effect on the quality or size of residences that the newly recurited professors often have a short time of living experience, one or two years, since they normally have to hurry to arrange their second home for reporting to his or her work duty upon the decision of recruitment. They also would be young that they have no chance or sufficient period to build a personal wealth. In this case, the shabby shelters might be their only option which likely influences their shared identity and attitude. This context of challenge had not been hidden behind their personal strivance, but was attended with a priority of campus agendas. The university faculty actually establshied the plan of support for the residential problem of newly hired professors. Within the nomad group, the sub-culture can be identified depedening on their hometown, alma mater, and specific context of stories (2013; 2102). However, it normally does not change the mode of shelters and residential experience of their living. However, the speific context of stories would have some effect irregularly. For example, the invitation of university as a ditniguished professor would gurantee a residence arrangement according to the campus regulation. The law school project in the 2005 would enable a student dormitory newly constructed with a fine furnishment that professors had used the room for their local residence, which aroused dual views, say, praisal for their spirit to share with the national examinees and indency as a professor. I supose their culture of affinity with and professional background from national exams would drive to prefer the WKB building. The nomad professors would feel that the teaching profession is esteemed and regarded as socially reputable on one hand, which would be a source of pride. On the other, they might feel relegated with the viscittude of their hey days – as a Seoul resident -or harsh nature of survival – only option to reside within this locality. Both factors generally made them more spiritual along a free time from home duty which transforms their personality more rigid and consistent on the professional performance. On the other, social existence may be spoiled for unwise professors. Howvere, it is also true that they tacitly could be a refreshment for the non-nomad professors, and social congruence within the faculty can be adjusted.  Episode attached for the first beneath the scene (iii) Scene 3 Time and Site : The first scene depicted the local Express Bus Terminal supposed to be used by the NPs, and was observed at the 5 o'colck, Friday, May 15. The observation of second scene occurred inside the KTX from six to nine o'clock, Friday, May 7. Rationale : I wished to reinforce my assumption that the nomad professors will have enchanted to detine for Seoul homes. It was Friady evening time expected to be fully reserved with a number of NPs. I made an appointment with one desk clerk, who is well situated to appreciate the mobility of bus users over the week days and time. It seems a good circumstantial evidence to complement with the public survey. The second scene was planned to investigate the KTX which seems most touched and sensible during their lives as a university teacher. It is supposed to critically determine their egos and shape their shared pattern of personal, social and pofessional lives (Creswell, 2013). One other altervtive, as implied, is via the Express Bus which would compete among another locally and nationally in tems of the user statistics and public administration by the government-owned KTX. I have arranged one nomad professor to share a time to each Seoul homes, which only consumes two hours for the recent construction of high speed rails. The observation would be helpful to experience their sentiment and professional reproduction between the hard week days and weekend travel. (iv) Scene 4 Time and Site : The last scene portrayed the campus tennis court and observed between two and four o'clock during the week day and weekend, April 15 and 19 respectively. Rationale and Evaluation: The tennis court is a most popular place where the socialization of peer professors occurs. Professors often use the sports for invigoration and refreshment which could distress and assuage themselves from their hard works. This is not only for the professors of CU, but shared culture or attitude of orgnizational members nationally and internationally. It is the kind of hobbies and personal amenities on one hand, but also a crucial niche that the socialization is confirmed and developed. The sort of sports would differ varying with the context of nations, and it seems prevelanet that the faculty of CU dominantly entertains the golf and tennis. Partly, table tennis explains for a small share of professors and students to answer the short vacanices between the classes. It would be superior to create the opportunity of sharing between the professors and students more than the tennis and golf. Nevertheless, both sorts are heavier in terms of faculty socializtion that the key adminsitrators of campus often utilize the informal golf society to exchange views and opinions of campus issues (Lombardi, 2013). The tennis club in campus is well orgnized that many professors joined it. It is informal and societal with no membership requirement or fees. They adminster a formal event of campus tennis competition annually, which is nationally networked with those of other universities. Last year, the faculty of Chosun won the second place in the national competition that was honored campus-wide. Besides the official event, their appointments seem to be occasional and instaneous that the free professors would call to arrange the meeting and their physical presence in the tennis court is enough to join the acting players. Given the artificial arrangement of golf meeting, the context of tennis club will be more adequate to deal with the quiries between the nomad and settled professors (Janesick, 2011). Since the golf meeting can be quasi-official for the selected professors on the administrative duty, even the nomad professors could not avoid or missed the opportunity of sharing. This factor could partially be related with the possible low share of nomad professors placed in the university administarion relating with one of my research questions. The context seems not to arise in the tennis case where the tennis enjoyment in campus had been processed voluntarily. I have chosen two occasions during the week day and weekend, which was attempted to produce any meaningful contrast (Creswell, 2013; 2011). The selection of tennis and two occasions of observation, therefore, address the need of purposeful sampling and the technique of maximum variation smampling (2011). As a non participnat observation of site and individuals, the data could provide a useful information anout the reality of faculty socializtion, personal and professional evaluation from two types of professors. The interviews with the tennis professors, often non-nomad professors, and partly from nomad professors on the weekday observation would comprise a wide of data sources to describe the case of nomad professors in CU. (b) An Episode : Scene 1and 2 Scene 1: Two Pictures of Campus Parking Lot Episode The parking lot for the professors of business and law departments is almost vacant with few of cars on Friday. Some rich students can afford with their private car, and may park it within the site. But such case is very rare and officially impeded by the departmental administration. And the signs of parking entrance indicate a blockage clearly on the stoned plaque. This means that the number of cars in the parking lot is correlated with the number of professors in the building. Although I had not applied a time lapse technique to show the mobility of cars over time, which requires a use of video materials, it seems in fair contrast between two days. At 2: 30, the Friday afternoon, one part-time lecturer had appeared who seemed heated from the completion of his three hours lecture. He was a little wet due to hot weather, and the kind of important person in his senior years as a bellwether to propose and advocate the welfare of local lecturers. There are five to ten prominent profiles of local lecturer, who served over the long period of time, and very familiar names with the law faculty. They seem to be placed at unique position to narrate their feel and phenomenology of nomad professors because of their strong settlement within their local community (Laureate Education, 2010b). They could be more candid and austere to express their opinion than the full time professors within the department because the latter group must be more social and receptive from the peerage. I asked to have a talk about the issue of campus vitality, the kind of deep serenity normally unexpected from the Seoul-based universities. He reluctantly sat beside me on the stone, and gave a remark about his experience and issues rather feebly. His statement was neither direct nor expressive that he was his forty's and seemed fatigued from his professional life. He was a local student and earned a doctoral degree of law here at Alpha University as most of his group did (Kim, 2014). He had a resident at the HKB building, a student dormitory, and earnestly been commissioned to teach his field of interest, the business law here. As the building is located right beside the law building and parking lot, he commuted on foot when he is scheduled to report for class. The opportunities of class depend on the performance and evaluation of college at the beginning of semester. It is a sensitive process determining that they manage their professional career and earn a small of living expense. They are keen to the decision of college, but the composition had generally been stable with a few competent names yearly. He is most settled and considered as an intrepid to lead the group departmentally and campus-wide. A suicide of part-time lecturer in the Department of English once stirred a national arousal for the improper workplace relationship between the research assistants and hiring professors. The professor had suffered from his unethical abuse of work hierarchy exploiting a cheap labor, imposing excessive loads of research, and omitting his name as a collaborator in the publication. He allured him to exploit with the promise of hiring as a full time professor for ten years, but eventually disappointed him, who felt no such possibility at the end. He advanced to cease himself and committed a suicide. The position of part-time lectureship is traditional over the departments, in which the local ethos and culture are dominant despite their professional character. The aspect of socialization and educational effect on the students could well be testified from this group in terms of overall atmosphere of department and campus. The lecturer with me raised many interesting points arising from his close campus life. His observation corroborates with mine that the number of cars radically diminish around this time weekly. He knew that the university administration also recognized this phenomenon and respond with the regulation for the compulsory four-days class schedule. To say, the college class team is mandated with two plans for each professor. The professor must either choose Monday to Thursday schedule or Tuesday to Friday schedule. It implies that some nomad professors may compress their schedule for two or three days weekly which is unacceptable as a matter of professional responsibility. The option is alternate between the semesters leading to the dynamism of nomad professors with such stuck-four days. He explained, \"there is no surprise at all.\" He rather seemed to enjoy this vacancy and idle campus to the interest of his deep amusement on the environment and philosophical strolls. Actually CU campus is one of nationally renowned scenic place where the tourists would not miss with their visit at Gwang-ju, and weekly resort place for the local citizens. I cordially asked his perception and diagnosis as an educator. He said, his stance is to keep the pride and welfare of their group. They actually organized the association of parttime lecturers within the campus, and have a network at local and national scale. He commented, \"We stand on the odd status as professional organization since they feel sacred as a public educator, but low pay as well as no pension entitlements. Therefore, their cause and campaign could be seen as the issue of contingent workers, and issue of due social esteem. They once claimed to call them a \"casualized professor\" rather than \"part-time lecturer.\" This point was interacted positive that many students and professors socially redeem their status in calling their title as they want. Given this issue were to be settled, the economic issues turned to be more readily negotiable implying how much the sense of pride is important for the teaching professions in the public university. They have a local basis often firmly and the living expense can be manageable enabling them to feel as an expert of their interested subject and live on the social esteem from their neighborhood. For them, it seemed that the toned campus without noise and quarrels would rather be a chance to enrich their research and amusement. It is needless to say about the six months of vacation that they could be said to be a really authentic professor. His story has been interesting to think about the personal, social and professional lives of nomad professor (Patton, 2002), \"They are felt likely a migrating bird. I had once meditated how the education could be intimate, and thus effective given their quality to move weekly. However, I realized that the local students would not discern between the settled professors and nomad professors. This sense had been acquired for my long period of experience within the WKH building as my residence. It is the place where the local elite students prepare for the national exams and their dormitory. I culturally shared with them, and they see same utility and affinity from such different group of professors. This seems that the university education is professional that the competence of teaching and research is most discriminatory in assessing the educational effect. The initial thought about the importance of close contact and life sharing was not practical actually. I also considered that the college students are an adult and beginner as a member of liberal society, who think of merits, individual diligence and talents more in priority than socialization. They seem to side more with the professors of academic achievement, and think that the socialization often matters within the faculty. This is a unique feature seemingly underlain in the university education. The opposite paradigm, of course, is identified, for example, the duty of consults time with the student, but a slim part for them.\" Scene 2 Local Residences of Nomad Professor Episode The scene above was pictured when I visited one nomad professor. I had arranged one night stay, and shared time from five o'clock, May 12 through 3 o'clock May 13. It was a newly built apartment and big size compartment was owned by the male nomad professor. He was a career professor who had served twenty years at the college of engineering and his retirement age will come soon. He looks intelligent and wore deep angle eyeglasses emanating an aura to show his fatigue of research and teaching decades. His hair is grey and said, \"He lives alone and weekdays only,\" as expected. He actually was one venture capitalist, but his passion and commitment as a university teacher seems firm and even philosophical. His success brought a modest wealth and said, \"He is proud of his professional lives.\" I was interested in his personal and social lives, and his reply was very salient and definite, \"The success of professional achievement brings all the problems in order and maximum personal satisfaction, good social relationships and improvement of economic conditions.\" His comment seems to be confident on his career experience and such trajectory of service years in the CU (Ginsberg, 2009). The one night stay allowed me an important point of triad dimension of nomad professors, and can be corroborated with the attitude of college students as in the parking lot episode. I had some reflection why the successful professors and students would come to view the phenomenon in such common perspective. That might be because the students normally are prospective of bright future and strive for their success. I come briefly hit between the liberal individualism and socialism. Although the communist states have a constitution pronouncing that the \"talent and ability\" shall be the core of individuals -ironically no such words in the liberal constitution, but only with the \"liberty and human dignity\" therein -and could be ensured to its perfection, the problem of incentive may get the nomad professor and students of WHK right. The living room is large and three rooms were facilitated. The luxurious arm chairs, one for single and the other for three rest men and one small rectangular piece for a cursory sitting were centered at the living room and one grass-ceiled tea desk was accompanied at the center of space. On the zoned corner of the room upfront the scene is zoned a cute kitchen and dining table which can be attended by four persons at right table and six persons standing to drink with brief food at the left table. Right beside the space of armchairs, some cute collections were furnished within the two sections of window wall with an aid of light, and one big round symbol of Greek myth. Right beneath the symbol can we see the audio facilities facilitated within the grass-wall setting. One big window facing the sunrise had made the space open to the street outside. The dominant feel is that the residence is westernized and very detailed with decorations and luxurious provisions. Often this kind of house management is seldom possible without the efforts of housewife. I have asked the extent of assistance from his madam. His reply was, \"Since she had long worked as an expert of social welfare in Seoul, the living here is virtually the product of mine. However, the interior was purchased at once when I moved in. That does not reflect my personality.\" His explanation disappointed my expectation of warmth and hospitability image on his person, and implied if he had probably been artificial or intense with his professional duty of spinoffs and local firm he established. This aspect seems also distinguishable from other type of successful professors who settled locally and manage the normal family lives. The age of technological advancement likely pushes many professionals tightened and mechanized to be circular within their time schedule and of less social time. The University Communication provides the electronic note of time schedule for campus members, which was filled on various times and appointments recorded by himself.

Observation of a Video Segment (a) A Guide to Effective and Productive Observation As Patton guides, a skilled observer has to do know how to separate detail from trivial in order to achieve make his observation inclusive and comprehensive, but with precision and accuracy (2002). He also needs, among others, to learn to pay attention, to use systemic methods to validate and triangulate observations, and to report the strengths and limitations of one's own perspective. In observing the video, I tried to apply the advice from Louis Pasteur that the prepared mind makes the observations productive. Timely and important contemporary observations are very powerful as we see, for example, the source of Escherichia coli outbreak found with direct observations of German authorities (2002). This aspect could be reinforced with the prepared mind that they were spirited to respond with the deaths of 30 people by observing systemically the pattern of infected disease. We can approach to observe the classroom activities in the video from the assumptions and perspectives. The research supported by this video material may be purported in many research objectives, for example, most effective ways of math instruction in the earlier grades of elementary school. The context is unknown and actually open to the wider possibilities of research scope. Hence, my observation is devoted to description itself, but with the tip of advice by Patton. As we see, Merton, one of noted modern sociologist proposed four sets of ideals as to the goals and methods of science and binding on scientists (Merton, Storer, 1979). They comprised the communalism, universalism, disinterestedness and organized skepticism. The first three inculcates the general trait and perspective of social scientists which could often be illustrated or ascertained with the work of peers. Although it is a grand frame to characterize the work of social scientists, I may apply to the observation of class scene. Hence, I can be assumed to be minded and prepared with the proposition. The human agent can be universal and to prescribe the observation in terms of universal or impersonal criteria and not on the basis of race, class, gender, religion, or nationality. This can be called universalism in his four. The human agent can be communal to cherish the common ownership of scientific discoveries, who rather trades his intellectual property in exchange for recognition and esteem (Conwell, 1917). This ideals or trait of sociological researchers would acknowledge the conditions and particulars of community and the communal value would come profiled and extended so as to be permeated into the perspective or inform the direction and goals of research. The queer theory on the female stance and tone could be one example in the female community of US or Japan. The third ideal or trait of researchers would be disinterestedness where the outwardly selfless ways of acting and dealing in his research process can merit and be rewarding in terms of various goals of sociological knowledge. This is called disinterestedness and could have a strength in terms of objectivity and neutrality, which, however, requires a sensitive attention and continued care through the process. The kind of Buddhism or meditative process on mental condition could be evoked to depict the minded preparedness within this ideal. That is because the disinterestedness is less easily achieved or maintained since the human agent is learned and inculcated, implying well be biased in advance. For example, the observer of class scene with the background of elementary teacher would feel habitual and customary to have more possibilities of self-perspective in observation. Finally, Merton proposed a view of organized skepticism which importantly deals with the kind of feedback and co-construction of sociological knowledge. The ideal required that all ideas must be tested and are subject to rigorous, structured community scrutiny (2002). The importance of organized skepticism is much more implicating and consequential since we study the sociological studies other than natural science, powerfully penetrating the disciplines of social science. Given our topic, the three ideals may not be separable even though it could be sensed in the extent of one ideal, and can be applied to the observation. To say, I may describe the race or gender within the participants – communal to question the US society or gender community. I may be universal to question the effectiveness of math education for the first grade student by focusing on the attitude and manner of interaction. I may be prejudiced with the OECD statistics of low rate of math performance by the US students, which can infuse a different perception in the course of my observation. This would be communal in the classification. I may assume myself as strongly disinterested since I am not occasioned to teach math to such earlier age of participants. In any case, I may observe with three qualities in mind as prepared – perhaps mostly universal and disinterested. The organized skepticism will be for the peer students at Walden. (b) A Focus and the Observation My focus to observe the class scene is how much affordable, cultural and well spaced the classroom is and how the participants are sanguine, lively and satisfied with the class activities. The running time of video roughly is around 6 minutes and the close-up shot was taken to capture the narrow coverage of whole classroom (Laureate Education, Inc., 2012d). The close-up shot ran more than half of whole time, which turned to reveal the rear of classroom some time later when the class comes to end and lunch instruction was given. If not affected from the shot approach, I can readily notice that the classroom is narrow and less spatial. That can be objective in comparison with other classrooms, but can merely be my subjective feel for the observers at the same position or recent experience as an elementary school teacher. Such feel may come from my lack of experience recently, especially in the context of US elementary schools. I rather chance very intimately with the university campus, often large classroom and with a complex of buildings, especially in the case of spatial campus at my workplace. This can be a point, as hinted above, that the researcher cannot readily be disinterested without the meditative process and exercise of imagination. The white blackboard for instruction purpose was centered at the classroom while it is partly visible (2012d). Right before the white blackboard placed the hang board staffed with a wide white paper on which the students can write, present and discuss. Actually this was used by one male student upon the request of teacher to write the cent indicator for 53, which was the number as summed up with the cent amount held by three students. Two students rose the sign of quarter10, and one student, called Jack, is considered to hold three pennies. The interplay with the students by teacher, called Miss Rolin, is progressive and steady to teach a simple math of addition. He began, \"If I have two quarters, I have?\" Two students rightly become a quarter to provoke an interest of early math student. It seems very cultural and turns the student participants awakening and lively. They are sanguine and satisfactory through the end of class. She was very kind and attentive sp as not to confuse the students if saying \"Don't look at Jack...Pretend he is not here\" (201d). This seemingly leads the students more easily to reach the correct result of 50 cents. The classroom seems uniquely zoned to focus on the math instruction, which seems cultural if we narrow it to the use of math purpose, but non-cultural nor odd if the classroom will be used for various subjects. Right beside the hand board, the Mountain Math was posted at the wall to illustrate the implications or elements of math basic, which likely occupies the whole of student as the captive of math (2012d). The number, 17, 18, 20 are furnished in big yellow, and eight cursory drawings were furnished at upper space on the blue flank of wall. Turning around the wall, we can see a small water or coffee dispenser. It would probably be for fresh water assuming that the students around the age would not have a coffee. That is my culture if not the US case, but must be same if the coffee has some kind of narcotic effect. Dominantly the physical facilities afforded seem rather clogged and insulated, and densely zoned questioning the high affordability. That would not be a sense of small students at the scene and career math teacher. They actually seem familiar and home-felt through the activities and interaction, though brief. At this point, observer can be recess around the three ideals above, and could compare among the countries with the different culture and independent experience of physical facilities of this kind. They could be universal to fill the gap and discrepancy involved with his expectations, and could be more competitive by provision of comparison, which could possibly lead to the comparative study or argumentation based on the communalism. The participants would be seen five to six initially with one teacher, and the whole capture as later disclosed many others. In my guess, twenty to twenty five would be the whole class size. I gradually recognize the size of classroom that partially corrected the initial impression of less affordability. It seems sizable although I could not be complete to say it is sufficiently affordable. The class progress with Jack and one student correctly hit the answer at total for 53 cents (2012d). The interplay was lively and sanguine that the teacher and students seem satisfied with the understanding and achievement of math. Teacher says, \"$ 0.53. How many of you got that? Excellent. OK, Thank you for interplaying.\" The teacher is cultural as an experienced elementary teacher which purports to raise the attention of students, by saying \"Hannah, will you write 0.53 up there one way?... I want to see the other way, Because, remember, there's two ways we could do this\" (2012d). Oftentimes one becomes curious to hear two solutions or alternatives than one, which is deemed to effect on the earlier students. Andrew was selected to show two ways of writing 53 cents, and all the participants actively responds with the progress, sounding Yes and No to the teacher. For example, teacher says, \"What if I wanted to do this though?\", and the students respond, \"No.\" Her way of instruction is active and easing to learn the unit of cent to indicate in mark. It was made analogous with two things or persons in conflict or fighted, \"Tamara, why can't I do that?\" Tamara responded, \"Because they don't get along.\" Miss Rolin continues, \"No. They don't like each other, we don't ever see them together...\" Christian was cute, \"Because they fighted and the dollar sign was show-offing that he had more money.\" Since they are so early in age, they would be distracted with other experience, \"That's what Miss Zerkle said\" and \"Yeah, that's what Miss Zerkle said.\" The math instruction comes to an end at this point, and the teacher leads the lunch instruction and briefs on the next hours of class, who announces the probable trade of library time with the class attended by a special guest. It seems a rainy day that the teacher gives a generous lunch instruction with a possible change of eating place (2012d). As we note, the open observation last week is free of description depending on the assumption of observers (Janesick, 2011). The observation technique and considerations can involve with diverse possibilities of context in terms of assumption and episode although it could not differ from the physical quality and properties of observed sites or individuals. On the other hand, the directed observations are tightened and often focused so as not to be opaque or ambiguous about the observed sites or individuals and their interplay. The video materials often are classed as the object for directed observation if normal. This means that the theme or focus could readily be identifiable if it is considerable in the length of playing time. The video materials would be accompanied with audio and often portray the interplay of participants, which automatically directs the audience. The week material particularly instructs the nature of video materials in white big title letters. The directed observation would yield an increasing chance of common observation and similar results in description. Nevertheless, the research goals and questions for each researcher could lead to different results to some degree or else. Specifically, the focus of observer is important to factor the results of observation. I already have illustrated my focus in this exercise, \"My focus to observe the class scene is how much affordable, cultural and well spaced the classroom is and how the participants are sanguine, lively and satisfied with the class activities.\" One also could consider the philosophy or theory when the observer is prepared in terms of mindedness and orientation (Scriber, 2014). I have pointed out four ideals of Merton as the kind of perspectives, and the observer may focus on the race or gender if the math teacher is black and female, which tastes with the communalism. The comparative perspective with a foreign country concerning the class size or magic helper on the lunch line up can also be seen in that light. The educational method of participatory teaching at the earlier stage of math education can possibly be seen as universalism or disinterestedness. (c) Reflection: the Observation over two Sciences The observation is important for the researcher of natural science without mentioning our elementary and high school's experience on microscope and devices. As we see, that is because the principal activities and goals in that area of curiosity is to discover something, occurrences or process of materials, objects and elements. The observation in terms of social science research may instantly be considered as less important, but its primacy or importance cannot be denied as same with the natural science in terms of the way of scientific process or data source (Hunt, Colander, 2015). It is because the discovery is a door-gate for the new horizon of knowledge still in the social science, although it could not be completed at the stage of discovery. It is, however, comparable with the discovery of natural science in sense even if we assume the general protocol of several steps to collect data suggested by Creswell – (i) locating site, (ii) gaining access and making rapport, (iii) purposefully sampling, (iv) collecting data, (v) recording information, (vi) resolving field issues and (vii) storing data (2013). The natural scientists, who are successful with his research goal or discovery, would write its significance, meaning within their disciplines and peer community, its impact on the human understanding of the nature and world, as well as social consequence if any pertinent. The natural science, therefore, also is inseparable from human elements and society although the extent is less direct or expressive. The discovery and related research on the atomic bomb in the Manhattan project might be one stark example along with the unethical stem cell research recently. The patent wars for the scientist from the engineering and natural science would incur implications that their work is related with the social and economic effect. It could earn them a personal wealth economically on one hand, and should subject to public control, such as exception for patentable scope, compulsory use for public reason as prescribed by the patent law. More saliently, the underdeveloped countries generally abhor of the projected protection of patent rights in terms of statutory period of legal protection. While the social scientists often begin with the analysis and presentation based on the stored data, the data itself are not the end point as distinct from the natural science. In other words, the natural scientists would turn on the discovered fact as thematic, but the social scientists still have to take a prolonged and discrepant process in terms to complement with other data forms, more controversial or multifarious analysis and interpretation of data, as well as the stronger extent of social construction (Hunt, Colander, 2015). The implications of comparison and analogy between two research areas suggest (i) the observation is most basic and beginning process for the new knowledge generators, hence, creativity of research (ii) It could be a major tool for the natural scientist while it explains for a considerable extent of importance in the social science -however, varying with the types of approach and research design (iii) the observation is most close to the natural science and qualitative data in one sense although the internal process or conditions of participant could not be revealed (v) observation is more important within the qualitative studies other than quantitative one given the deep investigation of participants beyond the public survey (Creswell, 2009). As with the patent right, observation in the social science generally should be more than convincing than other forms of data in terms of evidentiary effect. However, this does not guarantee that it could not be complicated or tainted because of human intermediary in the social science, who is a researcher himself as once said. This seems perhaps a divisive line between two areas in which the art of qualitative researchers engaged in the observation could divulge. They have to be accurate and precise as the natural scientists do, but they could be talented to phase out or gives a focus to unravel the distinct voice or phenomenon, grounded theory as well as the cases of social or culture-sharing group. The natural scientist and quantitative researcher may internally be affected more than the qualitative researcher in terms of their political or economic mindedness. To say, they would like to earn an income from his patent, and even become a venture capitalist if in the radical and successful cases. The quantitative researcher would be funded and provide an expensive information – more frequently for the majority in the society. The tone or deals of qualitative research, however, is often characteristic of minority group to raise their conditions, personal and social meanings, voice and action. It is more social than political as Merton contributed during his entire professional life as a sociologist (Merton, Storer, 1979). He actually was one of proponents of focus group as a medium of qualitative research, which is relevant with this week topic, say, observation of video materials. The focus group is used to process the interviews and observations in terms of qualitative research. The teacher and students video had given a focus on their classroom activity. In the interview of focus group, a group of people, called a focus group, are asked about their perceptions, opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards a product, service, concept, advertisement, idea, or packaging. In the process, questions are asked in an interactive group setting where participants are free to talk with other group members. In the observation of focus group through the video materials, the process occurred in the same, as except for that the video recorder would be present other than interviewer and the interpretation and analysis might require more time than the well-organized interview results. It is subjectively factored to make it qualitative given the researcher is of sensory and intelligent agent, who would observe and record the information in any linguistic forms. It is objectively factored to make it qualitative given the participants also are of sensory and intelligent agent -despite a varying extent --who would act, move, perform and so. My reflection with two areas along with the quantitative method was impelled that the participants are an important component for the social scientist as if the universe for the astronomers or unusual fish for the biologist, toxic materials for the chemist. Their meaning may be received as a number data or serious soul as in the in-depth interviewees or video of native Africans in the ritual. The observation is some act similar to that of the natural scientist, but with a trait different among another. Hopefully, the number in this case, whether samples of case studies or positive response of scaled public survey, should not be the number of harmful virus or meaningless cells, but the souls or populace which is an end destination triggered by the social scientist. B. Sampling Strategy with an Illustration (a) The Nomad Professors in the Alpha University As previously presented, the research plan on the nomad professors of CU has three major research questions and eight sub-questions. It has most traits of case studies among the five major qualitative approaches within the Creswell's. In corresponding with the general tips dealing with my context of case studies, the sampling strategy, sample size and length of interview time were determined. Most important in the qualitative studies is the trait that the iterative journey, including such as daily feedback and re-tracking of data, recordation of information, through the analysis of data and even new framing of structure of thesis until the research purpose and goals are satisfied. This aspect of qualitative research is due to its intrinsic dealing with the qualitative information, to say, open nature of inquiry, dynamic aspect of information, trait of data collection, as well as its deep basis on inductive reasoning. Hence, for example, the chain or snowball sampling begins offhand with a random sample in the growing quest to locate the information-rich people or cases that will be researched. It is growing and dynamic while initial sample design may go as less significant. Secondly, the saturation or redundancy in consideration of sample size is critical standard that the qualitative researchers almost always are destined that must be resolved. It often is disclosed at the point when the researcher realizes the size of sample should be large enough to leave you with \"nothing left to learn.\" In other words, they come to hit at this point that no new concepts will be emerging even if more interviews are to be conducted. This implies, on one hand, that the validity and credibility can be ensured in this way other than that of quantitative studies. On the other, the initial thought on sample size is not automatically controlling through the end of research in the case of qualitative studies. Hence, it is dynamic and flexible, and iterative with reflection within the whole structure of research. Along with the tentative proposal, the initial sampling strategy was summarized in the box form beneath. Table 1 Sample Size and Sampling Strategy Focus Groups and Sample Size Sampling Strategy Nomad Professors 8-10 The purposeful Sampling/Intensity Sampling/Typical Case Sampling/Criterion Sampling  Most Successful and Failed (Often Transferred) NP  Female and Male NP  Senior and Junior NP  Rich and Poor NP Settled Professors 2-3 Critical Cases Sampling/Politically Important Cases  Recruiting Professor  A Closest Peer Administrators and Other Informative Samples 3-4 Purposeful Random Sampling/Operational Construct Sampling  Dean of Department  Vice Dean of Faculty Board  Spouses of NP  Other Participant Table 2 Number of Interviewees and Length of Interview Number of Interviews Length of Each Interview 13-17 40 minutes-1 hours (b) Justifications The justifications can be surveyed from the general considerations of qualitative research as well as the discourse of sampling strategy. Justification 1: the purposeful sampling, critical cases sampling, and other sampling strategies had been adopted in consideration of human element to base the validity and credibility of my research as one of qualitative argumentation. The 13-17 interviewees included in the protocol of in-depth investigation along the examination of documents and public record will provide the field data, which constitutes a critical component to deal with the research questions, i.e., the identity of nomad professors and their personal, social, and professional lives that lead to the implications and policy suggestion. The basis of research is qualitative and deals with the humans, say, their psychic or social ego (Patton, 2002). The sampling strategy in the qualitative research often is designed purposefully as in contrast with the probability sampling in the quantitative studies. This aspect factors leading to the distinct structure, logic, metaphor, taste, quality, manner, consequence of specific research and feel or learning of audience. The research piece, notwithstanding books, articles and theses or dissertations, is a medium of professional communication. It begins immediately with the thesis supervisor for the graduate students, or submitted to the journal referees, and distributed as publicly available, either fee based or open access network from cause and transformation. The peer researchers may download or cite the research piece, and concerned intellectuals, including, but not limited to the reporters of media, journalists, high school teachers, aggrieved persons on gender discrimination, or undergraduate students and many others would read and learn. While I do reserve with the strengths of quantitative studies, this shows that the human agent is critical part of interplay within the world of science (2002). This relates with the kind of dualism between the outer world and inner psychic. The outer world had gradually been exploited and changing. The transformation in this e-age is made in any increasing speed as we note. Nevertheless, the basis of philosophy rooted on the mind and body dualism from classic thoughts could still be churned on the pros and cons of digital lives or preaching of Buddhism. The implication is serious between the things, outer world, and human. We may enchant on the perishing of earth from alien aggressions or terminator series, the kind of science fiction, to saturate our stressful routines. We, however, could identify a neighbor to be strenuous on reading or learning for his spiritual and intellectual lives (Janesick, 2011). The dark of earth from a remote sensing with no humans if with perishing may be impressive as we are assumed in the beginning of Hollywood cinema. The embalmed death body in the parlor of communist nations, the greatest perhaps for his people, would be the other impression we can contrast between the soul and outer world. Creswell guided the greatest, ordinary and marginalized, to impress the frame of qualitative studies, which I may align with the bell type assumption, implying the neutral tendency and two margins of extremes, from the quantitative studies. This does not say both methods are same in quality, but we can know the ultimate destination is made on the human agent. The sampling will be considered in days of analysis and comparison even with a matrix for most productive data collection leading to the competitive learning of research questions. The second important implication is that the outer world is not merely an insipid environment, but can overwhelmingly influence and shape the social egos.1 The third implication would be the utility and validity of scientific research. If the structured and organized discussion on these implications can require a sedulous work of pages, I may come illustrative to as to the purposeful sampling strategy. One qualitative research hung for our studies is concerned of life history research. It is the dissertation of our peer student titled, \"Exploring the Intrinsic Role of Agency and the Extrinsic Role of Social Expectations for Adults Who Learn to Read: A Life History\" (Stoutmorrill, 2009). As expected, it did a purposeful sampling as the data collection method. Besty, an author, was bred in the family and her father was an illiteracy, which motivated her studies for the people who learn to read. The familial environment apparently seems to seize her to work on this theme of research. This odd could be multiplied in our encounters, in which the superintendent of high schools may research on the funding strategies in the business school or the manager of social enterprise works on the studies of non-profits within the public policy and administration (Laureate Education, 2010e). Although Lombroso studies of criminals had a focus on the shape of skeleton for the probability of criminal activities, many studies demonstrate the high correlation between the environment of his or her growth and crime rates. The factor of gene code for the personality of individual would arise from the natural science likely with that of Lombroso, the kind of social factors is vastly assumed for the tenure articles of university teacher over various disciplines of social science. The interesting point here is that the social scientists, for example, educators and public administrators would compete with the gene theory arguing that due education or correctional effort of prison system can convert or transform the personality. This may be one example where the natural and social science come across (Hunt, Colander, 2015). Then why is human other than the nature? We can instantly reply, \"That is because we are forced to only be responsible for the people.\" The nature could not pursue to the end of responsibility for men or women\" It is stupid to communicate with the nature or things. A claim to recover the damaged parking lot or spoiling activities to pollute arises from the people in authority, not from the damaged property itself. Of course, we may be so vulnerable as to be perished of our earth by per chance collision with a large meteorite although we are callous with various Hollywood cinemas of that kind. I would not go farther alleging that the natural scientist would eventually turn on the impact of humans or society, but the importance of humans, even the end point that the social scientist could come in delights for his or her research work, is obvious for us. It is the area that both sciences could depart in which the object of studies would be separable among the nature, things, humans and society (2015). They could collaborate that the public administrators in crisis management would be aided with the research findings of earthquake and other scientific information. However, the kind of merger, darkened and invisible between the environment and personality, as we note above, would not be a matter of their concern, but that of qualitative researchers over interviewees or sites. In this light, my sampling was principally targeted at the population and human informants. However, the progress will require that data collected from the interviews can be complemented with the public record, documents, photos and even videos as appropriate (Creswell, 2013). Then we come with a third implication about the validity – also credibility and authenticity - and utility of social science research. We can hit, for example, at the proposition of Merton about his contribution to the concept of focus group and qualitative 1 In this aspect, it seems useful to consider the Levin's psychology on the formula dealing with the three elements, i.e., \"behavior, person and environment.\" research (Merton, Storer, 1979). He actually is one of great scholars within the social science who explored and ordained the important theories and perspectives. He is called a living legacy on the sociology of social science, which founded a pluralistic and diversified class of social reality and phenomenon. As influenced by European thinkers, such as E. Durkheim, and Parson Talcott, his view expands the horizon as mixed with the realist perspective of American sociology. For example, Merton believed that middle range theories bypassed the failures of larger theories because they are too distant from observing social behavior in a particular social setting. According to Merton, middle-range theory starts its theorizing with clearly defined aspects of social phenomena, rather than with broad, abstract entities such as society as a whole (1979). This ethos of American scholasticism had been prevalent, for example, casebooks other than the text books in the law school curriculum, and a plethora of qualitative studies based on the focus group involved with the US federal government. It is true that the United States federal government makes extensive use of focus groups to assess public education materials and messages for their many programs (Creswell, 2009). The repercussion has come opposite that a considerable number of these are appropriate for the purpose while it is questionable for the policy makers to buy in the results of research notwithstanding the strengths of focus group. Since the focus group is an important strand in the purposeful sampling strategy, the context is relevant with the topic of this week. We note that the theory or philosophy plays a critical role in the qualitative studies. It was stated above that the European intelligence on the larger theory and philosophical thought – often disinterested, neutral and principled or frame building nature – had been a thread and theoretical stimulus or engine to build up the American qualitative understanding of world and reality as exemplified in Talcott and Merton (1979). That said, we can put some triad in circular into the kind of brief concept map as you note below. One query within this stream of interplay is why the Europe is theoretical and doctrinal. It is called old world, say, political space of once World hegemony, to horizon their view in the universal context who would intellectually be leading. The rich wake of international politics and hegemony on the new world, ironically the name of symphony from Dvorak around the time of emergence, may bring a new theoretical ethos in the US, which is interesting to wait and see. We generally sense that Korean social science is theoretical and doctrinal in major attribute. Given its sovereign reality, we agree that it has no relevance with the case of old world. The fact seems that they teach the doctrines of western origin and feebly report the case studies or qualitative findings as particularized to Korea. They use a Korean language when they teach the doctrine, and they write in English when reporting the research findings. This shows a varying type of intellectual trait and research community of nations in terms of politics and language. This aspect would complicate the notion \"sociology of science\" in other viewpoint, which was not touched by Merton (1979). The sampling strategy in the nomad professors of CU can possess the factors of this kind that brings me with the challenges and difficulties. The literature would be scant and the interview language is incongruent to description. The points are considered to shape the best adequate frame of sampling strategy. Since I had a background as legal scholar, I like to mention the flavor of qualitative studies with the legal research. The narrative investigation can be interposed analogically with the critique and analyst of case laws. They compile the case laws, which will be recent as well as problematic and rendered by the influential court, such as federal circuit and Supreme Court cases. That would be the narrative they cherish as a raw data, and they would analyze the meaning and problems, present his viewpoint and opinion or suggestion hopefully, although they do not use a systemic coding from NVivo. That could be intensified on one or two cases when we find a more attribute as the case studies in the qualitative approach. Merton and the court provide a good ground in formality and structure of reasoning to validate the qualitative research (Creswell, 2009). Merton expounded a final importance of \"organized skepticism\" within his four-frame of ideals in terms of social science research. That closely approximates the skepticism of law faculty for the Supreme Court decisions. I once had mentioned the influence of Kant on the philosophy of aesthetic, which seems pertinent for the legal or qualitative scholars. The architect of knowledge is deeply centered on the human himself, and this aspect seems an important property to be adequate and persuasive.2 This leads to any adequate sampling strategy from the extent of career experience as lawyer and legal scholar, who might sift and winnow on the propriety of witnesses in the pending case. The selected witnesses might likely be a purposeful sample to construct the intent of lawyers or qualitative researchers. Figure Science, Research Methods, Sampling 2 Swedish artist Måns Wrange has used the concept of the focus group in his work The Good Rumor Project. In this instance the focus group also plays an agent to spread the rumor across the society, which brings a concern and importance of validity and credibility. The ascetics of research presentation could be crippled in this case, but should be attended at least in the work of artist or researcher. Justification 2: The kind of strategies adopted by the researcher is discriminative, critical, contrasted, and political as well as standardized and criterionbased, which can be exemplified in the deviant theory. Given the sociology is to recognize and theorize on the diversity and pluralistic standing, Merton's idea is useful. He proposed the paradigm of deviant behavior involved with the attitude to goals, attitude to means and modes of adaption (Merton, 1961). Five types of deviant behavior could be identified. For example, one type person accepts the attitude to goals and means, and he may conform with the modes of adaptation. In some cases, the person can reject the attitude to means and become innovative to adapt. In some cases, the person relies on ritualism by not attempting to adapt since they reject the goals, but accept the means. The retreatism or rebellion is an interesting mode of adaptation. This frame can be applied to exercise the purposeful sampling on the study of nomad professors in the CU. The retreatism can possibly comply with the low performance and loss of enthusiasm in aspects of their personal, social and professional lives. The ritualism could be practiced with the personal and social impression, for example, long night enjoyment in Pub or Noraebang (Sing Room) in some cases of nomad professor. An overwhelming devotion to prepare the American Social Science Qualitative Studies : Rationalism/E mpiricism/Rea lism/Existentia lism Quanatitative Studies : Statitiscs and Numerical Persuasion Probablity Sampling : Philosophy + Headcount Purposeful Sampling : Philosophy + Soul students for the national exam in the trade of personal amenities could be classed as one type of ritualism for the nomad professors of law department. The naturalist resides within the deep forest and is relatively long distanced of his residence, who is one of NPs, but insistent to stay at Gwang-ju despite his Seoul-residing madam. The rebellion would rarely occur because the profession is deeply wanted for various reasons. We can suppose if they are radical or even rebellious through the activities of faculty board against university administration (1961). That is especially implicating that the CU has a tradition of strong faculty board and mainly of democratic culture across the campus. Nevertheless, the rebellious activities in this sense are more probable with the settled professors. This trait is related with their low rate of staff record for the university administration. The innovation as a mode of adaptation bears some extent of relevance for the successful nomad professors over his professional career. This type was briefed in the episode last week that they possess a caliber of quality and competence to be innovative and profitable more than the settled professors. The selection of samples is made of purposeful sampling which could dramatically divulge the contrast we can miss from the neutralization tendency and with general assumption of group as an ordinary professor (Creswell, 2013). A teaching in regards with the sampling strategy can be applied among the greatest, marginalized and ordinary professors. This selection could only be possible with lengthy observations and interpersonal concession. It is highly unlikely that they could strip him or herself readily at the first proposal. A sedulous contact will be pursued, and the period of time to observe the nomad professors is sufficient to class the types of deviant behavior and considered to pose no challenges given my ten years of service as a nomad professor there. Justification 3: The sampling strategies were considered fully from the general discourse of sampling strategy. Sampling in terms of research method, refers to the selection of individuals, units, settings to be studied, and the trait within two major classifications would lead to the different context of sampling strategy (Nastasi, 2009). That is because the quantitative and qualitative studies pursue different goals -empirical generalization to many in the former and in-depth understanding in the latter. Therefore, the quantitative researcher would include the variety types of people as a sample to infer to a population, and the qualitative researcher interested in the victim of sexual crimes would choose the sample purposefully from the victims exclusively. Nevertheless, it is true that the qualitative researcher might investigate 10-20 children to deal with the experience of children about the tsunami in Japan. It could be seen statistical from the number of whole population, 3,000, and similar with the quantitative inquiry in terms of the sample size. In my case study of nomad professor, this aspect arises between 6 samples and 400 NPs of CU as the total number of professors. In thinking of sampling strategy, the qualitative research would consider three factors, that is, research questions and purpose, time frame of study and resources available. The following diagram shows the common qualitative sampling strategies presented by Dr. Bonnie Nastasi, Director of School Psychology Program at Walden (2009). Table 3 Qualitative Method and Sampling Strategies 16 Sampling Strategies in the QS Extreme or Deviant Case Sampling – Looks at highly unusual manifestations of the phenomenon of interest Intensity Sampling – Chooses information-rich cases for intense manifestation of the phenomenon Maximum Variation Sampling – Selects a wide range of variation on dimensions of interest Homogeneous Sampling – Brings together people of Similar Backgrounds and Experiences Typical Case Sampling – Focuses on what is typical, normal and/or average Critical Case Sampling – Samples for most production of critical information Snowball or Chain Sampling – Samples from people that arose to know what cases are information-rich Criterion Sampling – Selects all cases that meet some criterion Theory-Based or Operational Construct or Theoretical Sampling – Defines manifestations of a theoretical construct of interest so as to elaborate and examine the construct Confirming and Disconfirming Sampling – Seeks cases that are both expected and the exception to what is expected Stratified Purposeful Sampling – Focuses on characteristics of particular subgroups of interest (facilitates comparisons) Opportunities or Emergent Sampling – follows new leads during fieldwork, takes advantage of the unexpected and is flexible Purposeful Random Sampling – Looks at a random sample Sampling Politically Important Cases – Seeks cases that will increase the usefulness and relevance of information gained based on the politics of the moment Convenience Sampling – Selects cases based on ease of accessibility Combination or Mixed Purposeful Sampling – Combines two or more strategies listed above The sampling size within the qualitative inquiries has no fast and hard rules, which differs from the quantitative studies that is aided and facilitated from the rule of statistics (2009). It is simply true that most qualitative researchers would share the concern if the sample size is saturated or redundant or if it is sufficiently large to represent the variation within the target population, to put other way, to assess the appropriate amount of diversity. The normal size may vary with the different approach in which (i) the biography or case study would select one case or one person (ii) the phenomenological studies often asses 10 people (iii) the grounded theory, ethnography and action research assess 20-30 people, which typically is enough to reach saturation (2009). The issue of sample size also arises involved with the data collection method in which (i) interviewing key informants requires approximately five people (ii) in-depth interviews require approximately 30 people (iii) the focus groups create groups that average 5-10 people, the number of which must be determined by considering the research questions (iv) ethnographic surveys select a large and representative sample. Along the issue of sample size, the quality and quantity of database need to be considered (2009). The interview protocol and length of each interview generally impact on this aspect of research design in which (i) 10 interviews may require 12 hours for best result, (ii) 20 interviews with 30 minutes to one hour (iii) 30 interviews with 20-40 minutes. The context described so far was applied to my sampling strategy. Reference Angrosino, M.V. (2006). Doing Cultural Anthropology: Projects for Ethnographic Data Collection, Long Grove.

On the Interview Skills and Some Reflection (a) What is In-depth Interview? The in-depth interview is an unstructured interview that seeks opinion of respondents on a one-to-one basis. It needs to be distinguished from the focus group interview where an interview is conducted by a trained moderator with a small group of respondents, normally 812 and prescreened as homogenous. Besides the in-depth interview, the data collection in the qualitative research may vary in techniques, for example, protocol analysis and projective technique, free word association, sentence completion, unfinished scenario completion, and cartoon completion test. While I will argue to support the qualitative method and interviews below, it is true that the interview is assumed of privileged status of interviewers and interviewees around the words used (Perlich, 2007). As we know, the knowledge and research involve with the aspect of communication and linguistic element, and scholars over various disciplines struggle with this element to elaborate and refine on their queries. The legal researchers and theorists of political science would spend most of their studious effort on the kind of documentary examination and even translation. They may cherish the quantitative data or statistical facts to use, but can only girdle to support their message. This process to reach their tenet or proposition is obviously qualitative implicating much role of language. Since the documents and public record in words of foreign countries are written and ready to the constant reference of researchers, it is considered to pose relatively little challenge than does the foreign interviewees. The cultures of specific region or society also can vary the expectations of interviewer. For example, qualitative research in Asia is not likely easy in reality although qualitative research techniques should be suitable theoretically in the Asia-Pacific countries (APMP Study Guide, 2015). The techniques of qualitative research, such as interviews and protocol analysis or focus group are used as less as ten percents in the Asian countries and conducted by the companies. This seems because (i) people feel more confident with numbers than with mere opinions (ii) they are cultural to hesitate to express opinion on sensitive issues (iii) groups in Singapore are less willingly to talk than those of the Hog Kong (iv) while expressing views, Hong Kongers are more impatient, and while Thais and Filipino have an in-built \"courtesy bias.\" (b) Interview Techniques in the Two Videos The video I seems a shortcoming as an example of dysfunctional or miscarried cases of interview in which we can feel a distance, a bit of unkindness and even tediousness about the shared journey to the workplace morale. The body language is not mild, but would create the kind of worship circumstance with an austere and rigid impression. The first stage of interview can cover the arrival process. The interviewers and interviewees interacted cursorily on the kind of exchange, and apparently were unorganized and carelessly attended or focused. The interviewee initiated the key elements of first stage interaction, i.e., the expected time of interview and due notation for taking notes or audio-recording during the interview time. We can notice that Linda Crawford hurried to make up by saying, \"Now, let me see, do I have the tape in here? Yeah, OK, Oh, how does this thing work? You know, everyone is different..... (Laureate Education, 2010c-i)\" It also seems unclear if the informed consent has been achieved in advance before conducting an interview. Most critically, the interviewer appears to be less engaged and uncommitted to the interview purpose and protocol. She seems mindless to discourage the interviewees by saying \"Nice people. OK. Now, we've all had bad workplaces (2010c-i).\" It is the point to be underscored that the interviewers are minded and active to attract the productive and useful information from the interviewees. Although the interview data normally are not the research findings itself – interpreted and analyzed or coded later – the information is vital for collaborative construction of meaningful knowledge. For example, the frequencies of word in the interview data can be keyed to the success of qualitative research project. The second video could be ascertained as a success in this standpoint of view that the researchers provide a thick layer of information about school morale, even the kind of key words derived from the part of interviewees, \"respect, support and openness\" or \"teacher, principal and community at large\" (2010c-ii). One important cause and ground of qualitative research is to sever the conventional play with the existing theories and tenets, which see the fresh idea of interviewers and interviewees as championed. That is because the human agent could possibly corrupt with the bias and prejudice in knowing and appreciating the outer world, most skeptically involved with the researcher himself. The participants can repair this fallacy that can be considered, in some aspect, as the kind of co-builder of new knowledge rarely attributed to the quantitative plan of research. The second one is in contrast with the first as simply manifest when we consider the duration of interview time (2010c-ii). The information given by the interviewees are rich, organized and sufficient to the coding and analysis work on the part of researcher, which is unlikely in the first case. We also can say that the interviewer in the first video generally comes problematic whether she established empathy and rapport with the interviewees. The overall impression is that the interview appears to be distractive and not richly clustered on the theme of research. It seems lacking or ineffective to introduce the research that must be duly and clearly conveyed within the second stage of interview. The preparation of interview seems inadequate that the interviewer inevitably should give a caution about the cord, \"Oh, hi Laura, Come on – watch the cord, please,\" and later \"Watch the cord please. Thank you. Don't trip. You will mess up my study if you do\" (2010c-1). These kinds of problem critiqued thus far likely are not present in the second case, which seems the kind of model in this type of qualitative interview. Setting aside the starting the interview (third) and ending it (fifth), the fourth stage is important to enrich the data in meaningfully coherent structure, which requires to keep focused. The contrast in terms of productivity of interview and extent of organized or coherent interaction seems obvious between two types of demonstration. For example, the interviewer use probing questions in the second video to keep the interview focused, \"I'd like to hear some of stories about the workplace morale\" (2010c-ii). The best practice was thought when involved with a distinct setting of interview with the child student and of the general five stages as presented henceforth. (c) Best Practice: As Specific for the Child Interviewees According to Partington, G., the technique of qualitative research interviews has evolved around basic quality of communication and the goals of scientific research, say, (i) establishing empathy and rapport (ii) listening and questioning (iii) restatement (iv) clarification (v) persistence (2001). As the data collection is any crucial part of research operation, we take care that the data might be corrupted by inappropriate questioning, inadequate listening, and lack of interpersonal skills on the part of researcher. The establishment of empathy and rapport is essential since it creates the circumstance and mood for the respondents to disclose the information candidly and without a hide. For example, the interviewees need to be selected as heterogeneous that only two aboriginal students would circumvent the need for the researchers develop the special knowledge and skills required to interact empathically with the aborignial students (2001). The supportive statement of interviewers generally results positively at the beginning of interview and as need arises. It is also made of effect that the interviewer should establish his or her role at the outset of interview. From this mindedness, the interviewers can prevent that the respondents will give up or provide monosyllabic responses. In order to obtain quality material and avoid terminating discussion on specific topics too early, the listening and framing follow up questions in the light of the responses are important. A problem with inattentiveness or prejudgment seriously tends to discourage the interview process, and the interviewers do best by demonstrating that he carefully listens what is being said. The restatement can have pros and cons, and has to be used to respond with the circumstances (2001). For example, the restatement is useful for ensuring you have correctly understood what has been said when the children and mentally or linguistically unsound patients are the respondents or the interview includes the aspect of difficult or sensitive points on shame or disrepute. Since it could unduly delay the interview hours and fatigue the interviewees, it has to be used in due consideration of its effective use. Clarification generally is valuable to exclude bias and misunderstanding that collects most accurate and proper evidence. Persistence can only help in a specific case to serve the purpose of interview (2001). It has the potential to aggravate the due conditions of interview and may even alienate the respondent to resist with not answering the questions. In this case, the different wording of questions or creation of new mood may be needed so as not to leave the potentially fertile field of investigation unturned. (d) Best Practice: General Guide with the Five Stages of Interview There are at least five stages in the qualitative interview process. In the arrival process, the interviewer would be checking the background noise, getting to know each other, setting up audiotape/recording equipment and etc (APMP Study Guide, 2015). In the second stage, the interviewer would be introducing the research. He explains the purpose of the interview, reason to select the participant, and expected duration of the interview. It is necessary to seek an informed consent of the interviewee, i.e., either written or documented oral consent, with the information sheet, as well as by explaining how the information is confidential and about the use of note taking and/or tape recorder. In the third stage, the interviewer gradually starts the interview as unhurried and by using open-ended question. The researcher should have some pre-planned questions to ask during the interview, allow questions flow naturally, and based on the information provided by the respondent (2015). I have mentioned on the persistence above, but it is general rule that the interviewers do not insist upon asking specific questions in a specific order. It will be surprising to find it usual that the flow of the conversation dictates the questions asked and those omitted, as well as the order of the question. In the fourth stage, the interviewer is keeping focused. The interviewer usually asks a factual question before an opinion question and prefers to use probing questions as needed. For example, the interviewer do good by asking \"Can you elaborate on the idea?\" than directing to the narrow and specific answer. In the fifth stage, the interviewer ends the interview (2015). It is a best practice to finish on time if possible, but to make sure everything has been covered sufficiently. It also will be best to make sure that the interviewer makes a suitable arrangement with the participant concerning the reviewing of the transcript material. He or she finally thanks the participant for their valuable time. (e) Some Note on the Two Methods and Interview There are separate views on the strengths of interviewing in conducting the qualitative research. For example, John Kotter, a Harvard Business School professor tacitly acknowledged its primacy in finding the truths, \"We learn best-and change-from hearing stories that strike a chord within us... Those in leadership positions who fail to grasp or use the power of stories risk failure (Silva, G.R.F., Macêdo, K.N.F, Rebouças, C.B.A., Souza, A.M.A, 2015).\" Other view would critique by illustrating ten standard objections to qualitative research interviews, which spans over the wide context of problems from the mainstream of social science. S. Kvale argued, \"Qualitative research has tended to evoke rather stereotyped objections from the mainstream of social science. Ten standardized responses to the stimulus [of] qualitative research interview are discussed: it is not scientific, not objective, not trustworthy, nor reliable, not intersubjective, not a formalized method, not hypothesis testing, not quantitative, not generalizable, and not valid (2015).\" He also called to heed if the interview could be highly predictable, meaning them to be considered into the process to design, report, and defend an interview study. Given an increased use of qualitative studies recently, he argued that it seemed relevant to raise the kind of technical issues, \"Can the interview findings not be due to leading questions from the interviewer?' It is also thinkable of epistemological issues such as \"Qualitative research does not lead to objective and scientific knowledge (2015).\" Nevertheless, I have been consistent with the indispensability of human element in terms of diversity and liberal cause and the critical importance of excavating a new knowledge. The communication is a vital process of human existence, and the interviewing or qualitative studies are based on the property of communication essentially. Then it could turn as a professional or scholarly communication depending on the art and skills of qualitative researchers and be submissive to the sense of audience in terms of reality, persuasion, aesthetics, and the kinds of humanity (Perlich, 2007). As begins with the verity of number from Pythagoras, it is considered immutable and uniform to penetrate the human recognition and awareness. It serves the ruler about their constituents or armies, and can be consonant with his normal citizens by indoctrination and inculcation. The measure is objective and obvious while that of qualitative research depends on the art and science of interviewers or documentary examination and evaluation. For example, weak or ineffective interview, perhaps the interview one in this week discussion can cause confusion, anxiety, and discomfort. Some examples of ineffective strategy are giving inadequate information even about the interview itself.3 Nevertheless, I disagree that it could be a ground to deny the merit of scientific truths produced from the qualitative inquiry (Varnell, 2013). It seems the similar context of status in terms of analogical insight as if the physics and chemistry – more precisely the biochemistry -stand in the natural science. The anger, despair, and many human senses could not be said as being not a component of truths since they may not be objective or varying with an individual. It will be odd to argue that only \"five feet 11 inches tall\" is true to describe a person, but should be unscientific describing if he has a propensity to get easily infuriated. The first is the kind of physical quality that may be measured as certain and accurate while the second can feel a kind of chemistry taste. Both are necessary to sustain the natural science as if we believe in two research methods in the social science. Darwinian understanding on the natural selection and random mutation could also be relevant that the humans can be changed with the scientific voice of feminist argument or intact cultural group. The humans possibly could be mutated as 3 Open-ended question and adequate body language could improve on the kind of issues. In this way, the interview can be strong and effective that will not cause the participant to feel uncomfortable, ignored or even coerced, but invite him to provide clear and useful information. influenced and affected, and it is real and any more accurate that cogito, ergo sum as Descartes preached in his treatise, Discours de la method. It should not be forgettable that the primate captain for the science is the researcher himself as he elicited. The humans will be perpetual like the deserted cans in the forest while the society reproduces itself unless the kind of Hollywood science fiction occurs. Most importantly, they are an eventual touchstone and end destination that appreciate, entertain, apply and believe on the message of researchers, if quantitative or qualitative and perhaps instantly from the abstract or excerpts or table of contents they provide. The knowledge generated by the quantitative research actually had deal with a primary goal of public education for national unity or congruence while sidestepping with the occasional voice of diversity and liberal advocacy. We may not fear, but should be less honest if this could have a potential to lead the humans as the kind of parts, robot or army worn of the uniform in the forest of efflorescent modern civilizations. Many people actually may be honest to state that they no longer cannot disguise himself or bear to be a hypocrite for his existence or post-modern reality. The smack capitalistic civilization can possibly shape the consciousness of humans in diversity and pluralistic awareness than could generally be described as of the whole population the quantitative researchers intend on. In this regard, Patterson introduced, \"a growing body of recent research shows that people with the most social power pay scant attention to those with little such power. This turning out has been observed .... Higher status people are also more likely to express disregard, through facial impression, and are more likely to take over the conversation and interrupt or look past the other speaker (2002).\" Although it had been to emphasize the power of direct observation involved with the qualitative research, it could, on the other light, imply between the masked knowledge to the social success and democratic knowledge of society at large. As the economy grows and technology advances, the generation of new knowledge faces the opportunities and challenges (Redlich-Amirav, Higginbottom, 2014). Its desired trend seems to depend on the researchers, and interviewing in this aspect is important to sustain the validity and credibility of research. It perhaps would be proper to stress on the primacy of quantitative studies often related with the moral gloss or messages on the general population as a whole. However, the qualitative studies stand on their own footing and justification, and it should not be merely to put asunder as fragmented, but with the construct and scientific power of persuasion in pursuit of democratic knowledge beyond the masked one. In this context, the skills and ethics of interviewing should be never to be trivial. B. Practice of Interview Questions (a) A General Note The process for conducting in-depth interview generally comprises (i) plan (ii) develop instruments, (iii) train data collectors (iv) collect data (v) analyze the data (vi) disseminate the findings (Boyce & Neale, 2006). In the planning process, the researcher or interviewer identifies the participant – said interchangeably stakeholders for its in-depth nature and \"nothing left to be learned rule\" in the qualitative data collection principle. He identifies what information is need and from whom. Often it can be made tangible with framing the interview questions and protocol arising from the research design and questions. In-depth interviews typically rely on multiple sources of information to provide the complete picture as possible. The most popular stakeholders would include the policy makers, program participants or clients, project staff, community members and clinic staff (2009). (b) Research Questions and Interviewees As previously discussed, my research questions would comprise two central questions and five sub-questions, and I alluded the five sub-questions to my open-ended interview questions around the prompt. The interview can provide an extent of data to solve the five sub-questions. How do they deal with their responsibilities and manage a personhood or social existence? 1. How do they manage their personhood or social existence? 2. How do they perceive or consider them with their counterparts or other professionals in the context of teaching performance? 3. How do they perceive or consider them with their counterparts or other professionals in the context of research performance? 4. How do they perceive or consider them with the counterparts or other professionals in the context of university administration? 5. How do they perceive or consider them with the counterparts or other professionals in the context of his overall professional lives? In my case, the nomad professors and community members are planned to be interviewed and the interviewees will range around 13-17. The interview time is expected of 40 minutes. For the interviewees from NPs group will be 6-8 and the community members or other information source also would be 7-9. The list of stakeholders was detailed in the appendix, and let me illustrate three interviewees for this discussion purpose. Figure 1 Character of Interviewees List of Interviewees (pseudonym; three people will be drawn from the class) Character of Interviewees Abraham  Group one : Nomad professors He is rich and senior professor at the age of 58, and achieved a remarkable success as a venture capitalist. He is a male professor and served around 20 years in the College of Engineering in CU. His lab manages many graduate students under his supervision and they collaborate to produce a competitive edge of research product. He is a frequent traveler between Seoul and Kwangju as his business or family need arises. His housewife is a working professional in the Seoullocated university as a research professor and he has two sons, who attend the high schools. He manages separate offices outside the campus near to Gwang-ju and Seoul. He has received awards and medals from the university and departments of national government in recognition of his professional accomplishment. Isabel  Group one : Nomad professors She was a recently recruited professor who now serves his first year in the CU. Her success to be selected as an assistant professor in the department of computer science is a big source of her pride that the competition had been intense with ten applicants. Her husband is working in the same field of expertise and commutes to the national center of computer research located in one local city near to Seoul. They had one boy and one girl who now reside with her grandparent in Seoul for educational reason. Her husband resides with their parent and children in Seoul. She recently obtained one room apartment on the monthly rental. The rent is small since she could not afford to buy or more expensive conditions of residence. She actually was disappointed with no care and no support from the university while many occasions of recommendation were filed with the university administration. Nevertheless, she cannot speak of this issue since she is expected to be faithful with local residences. Penguin  Group two: Spouse of Nomad Professor She is a female spouse of one nomad professor in the Department of English, who is a mid age and served seven years at the CU here. He and she married when the NP studied in the graduate program 13 years ago. They now have two children who are elementary school students. She resides with her children in Seoul, and her husband travels weekly or biweekly from Seoul to Gwang-ju, which takes four hours by bus and thirty minutes in the local cab. She works part-time in the neighborly store, and earns small money, fourth of her husband salary. She can think to move to Gwang-ju, but the education of their child generally hinders their decision. Her brothers and relatives as well as husband had a same thought that they should be educated in Seoul. She admires her husband, but sometimes feels gloomy over their separate weekdays.  Interview Time: Prearranged to get it noticed in advance for the interviewees  Interview Place: Prearranged to get it noticed in advance for the interviewees  Interview Hours: 40 minutes expected (c) Elements of Interview Protocol The second process is important that the researcher develops an instrument to successfully conduct the in-depth interview. The process hopefully expects to prepare the follow-up questions, and the questions are preferred to be probing and open-ended as a matter of qualitative trait (APMP Study Guide, 2015). For example, instead of asking \"Do you know the clinic services?\" ask \"Please describe the clinic's services.\" This type of inquiry could make it more probable to collect rich responses that could possibly refresh the general bias and conventional mind of career researchers and scholars. The practice of in-depth interview also guides that the interviewer ask the factual question before opinion questions. For example, ask \"what activities were conducted?\" before asking, \"what did you think of the activities?\" The types of probing questions include, for instance, Would you give me an example? Can you elaborate on that idea? Would you explain that further? I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. Is there anything else? As discussed, the stage of interview could be divided into five which I broke up with my activities on the research protocol (Boyce & Neale, 2006). Figure 2 Staged Elements of Interview Protocol Element of Protocol Abraham/Isabel/Penguin What to say to interviewees when setting up the interview? (Stage 1) 1. The kind of arrival process will be interacted. Oh, hi. Abraham/Isabel/Penguin. Pleased to meet you. I'm Kiyoung. Please have a seat. Thank you for taking the time for this interview. What to say to interviewees when beginning the interview, including ensuring informed consent and confidentiality of the interview? (Stage 2) 2. The research project will be introduced Your participation for the NPs project on the workplace morale and social congruence and satisfaction is really important as a study. It will help us understand more about how to support professors, institute a campus system necessary and increase an awareness of campus members, and ultimately help the NPs achievement, happiness and socialization. We'll be interviewing yourself and about 15 other professors, so we'll have all this information that will contribute to the project. Now, I know you've read about the project and how we are conducting it, but I'd just like to review a few items with you. First of all, as you know, your participation is totally voluntary. So if I ask you a question that you don't want to answer, or if you need to stop the interview at any time, just let me know. OK? Also, as you know, I'll be audio taping the interview, and also be taking some notes. When we finish the interview, I'll be giving you a transcript of the audio tape and sharing my notes with you, so you can look at them, make any corrections that you see need to be made. Make sure that we really capture what it is you want to say. The study may be published, and in publication, we won't use any of your names. Yourself or any of the other participants. Even if we use direct quotes, we'll use pseudonyms. And it also might be presented in conferences and professional meetings. Do you have any questions? As you know, we've set aside about 40 minutes for the interview. And that seems OK for you? OK. We won't go beyond that time unless you wish to do so. Audio taping is still fine? OK. Ready to go? Let's start, then, Abraham/Isabel/Penguin. What to ask the interviewees? (Stage 3, 4) 3/4. The interviewer gradually starts the interview as unhurried and relaxed. The kind of tips, such as probing question and factual v. opinion will apply. Prompt: Describe for me someone you admire, either a historical figure or someone alive today. Explain why you selected this person and why you admire this person. What to do during the interview? (Stage 2, 3, 4) 2/3/4. The interviewer actually set up the audio-recorder. The quality of sound and effective functions should be checked in the preparation stage. The audio-tape along with the notes will be provided for the interviewees, which provide the accuracy, certainty, and credibility of information. It will also enable a feedback and convenient process of coding, interpretation, and analysis. It will prevent costly redundancy of interview. What to say interviewees in concluding the interview? (Stage 5) Well, thank you so much. And as I said, I'll be sending you a copy of the transcript, and also my notes. If you see any corrections, or anything that I've missed please do let me know. Thank you so much, Isabel. Bye. Have a good class. What to do following the interview? The interviewer in this process will fill in notes, check audiotape for clarity, and summarize key information for each, and submit written findings to the researcher or store the data in the files. (d) Interview Questions The interview questions below were developed with other questions in the preparation, and will be asked for the three classmates for the purpose of mini project that will be stretched for the four weeks ahead (Janesick, 2011). The three classmates will use the pseudonyms specified in this interview protocol, and expected to pretend for the characters as described in the list of interviewees. The question purports to know the kind of idealistic personality which can help to infer his or her perception of personal, social and professional morals. It also helps to discuss and understand a desired condition for the two types of professors. For example, one interviewee may describe a persevered person as great, who should travel mostly in his lifetime and must be contingent of his or her life experiences to pursue his professional goals. Other interviewer, who will be a spouse of NP, may illustrate the personality and life career of warmth and familial hospitability. Concerning what to ask the interviewees above, the interview questions are prepared in corresponding with what to know about the research questions. Abraham/Isabel/Penguin Interview Questions 1. You are a rich nomad professor and aged (directed to the interview with Abraham)/You are a new recruited professor who has to travel weekly or biweekly for Seoul Home (directed to Isabel)/You are a housewife of nomad professor (directed to Penguin). Please describe for me someone you admire, either a historical figure or someone alive today (directed to all of three interviews commonly). Response: 2. Explain why you selected this person and why you admired this person. Response: 3. From him, what do you perceive most important and consequential for his professional or life success? Response: 4. From him, what do you perceive most important and consequential for his good or bad social relationship? Response: 5. Additionally to Penguin, from him, what do you perceive most important and consequential for his family lives? Response: 6. From him, what do you perceive most important and consequential for his personal happiness or misfortune. Response: 7. Can you elaborate on some comparison of his personal attribute with the general expectation from the university professorship? Response: 8. Additionally to Penguin, can you elaborate on some comparison of his family life with the general expectation of husband? Response: (e) An Epilogue from the Routine Days In Korea, the Quickie marriage is considered as one solution for the high rate of divorce since the current law denying no-fault divorce, and only on cause of fault of one spouse, would produce a spousal acrimony and incur a harm to the vestigial welfare upon post-divorce single life. It is a wise way to prevent the depraved status of failed marriage, but is not good method for the effective and satisfactory interview. That is because the interview generally passes as one time incident while the issue of marriage divorce, in fact, is inherent or persevering over period of time. The failed interview, regardless of his fault, leads to divorce of interviewer or researcher from the information he gathered from the process and often is irredeemable or costs a fretful rework for both sides. The consequence from this divorce really poses the challenge to the researcher since it leaves the information to be retracked, coded, and analyzed into any research piece. Therefore, it is serious that the interview is unproductive and fails to draw a sufficient – hopefully rich – information. It would produce a harm or ineffectiveness for the researcher, perhaps in converse sense, if the divorced couple from their marriage might try every effort to forget or eliminate the gloomy or unpleasant past of marriage. He or she rather tries to reflect the interview process, but with unsuccessful or insufficient information and perhaps hit the air in disappointment. This illustration simply shows the importance of interview protocol (Creswell, 2013). Atticus Finch, a fictional character in the To Kill the Mockingbird, a best seller book of Harper Lee, is a lawyer, who has a cause and competence to redress the social evils, the kind of folk hero devoted to the community. As a sequel to this novel, the book title, Go to Set a Mockingbird, alludes to the view of Scout Fish, a fictional daughter, who recast his father's wake within the community. The two novels likely guide on the two stages of research operation, i.e., data collection and data analysis within the qualitative studies. The researcher would have a cause to serve the community, and may rise to make a focus on the intact cultural group like an intrepid in the novel, which, of course, is accompanied by the interviews or note taking and tape-recording. He wishes to be a mocking bird – the kind of protagonist for the community -engaged deeply with his interview process, and would be pursuing and probing. The interview data will be set for the daughter of mockingbird later for coding and analysis, and the theme of disillusionment or bigotry of her father – actually the theme of second novel -comes to be put to the touchstone, i.e., whether the interview resulted either as successful for its focused and un-omitted nature or as unsuccessful in view of the neutrality and objectivity of scientific research. The lawyer behaved in the counsel or representation of client would work on the same ethos and compassion with the qualitative researcher, who relies on the liberal cause, but comes eventually as a moral compass for the community later. They also act and decide based on the evidence commonly. As the kind of y-tubes, camcorder or CCTV and even cell photos became available of a popular use, we not infrequently come across the crime scenes in the TV news, for instance, the battery of police or youths against the aged people, abuse of foster mom in the kindergarten and professor's contemptuous behavior against the research assistant. It readily hit my head how the sentencing sense of judges would be affected with the kind of technological advances. The tragic of Sewol ferry in South Korea last year had been mourned more than the past ones since the innocent high school girls, mostly smiling and with some bit of fear for their imminent fate, had been portrayed over the last minute of sinking ship through the video materials and aired to the public. It would be a shock for the public minds generally, and perhaps one good query for the researchers involved with the factors, for example, the extent of shock varying with the age range and gender. Old people or females probably may be more shocked than other groups. Nevertheless, the sentencing judges perhaps effort on the consistency among the cases of his earlier career years with no video evidence and those of video evidence recently. They rather would like to compare the narrative or testimony of witness between two cases than to be affected by the video scene at home. It implies of the importance for the description of interview data and interpretation in the qualitative research although rich and fresh information can be gleaned from the field data. Of course, the federal rules of criminal or civil law procedure may render the evidence inadmissible for other reasons. In attitude and requirement, he or she, in any way, efforts not to be murky or absent-minded, and take care to balance, who also might be minded even with the recent cases of difference relating with the availability of video evidence. A disparate sentence for the same culpability of crimes would imply of his professional mistreatment since everybody is equal under the law. The stare decisis rule developed and maintained in the common law countries pose the challenge more than the civil law countries since his work of sentencing balance may be sensically desired with the past cases if not in definitive legal terms. The aspect of this analogy evokes many implications as previously sketched. For instance, the human agent is a critical part of understanding the world and civilization, and how much the qualitative dimension of minds would be a factor to generate a new knowledge, and how the observation or sensory perception could possibly affect the conscience and awareness (Patton, 2002). The kind of field work is not the end, and has to be converted into description implying the importance of interpretation and analysis on the professionals, as illustrated with two occupations. The converted data – should not be fabricated, of course – are truly the kind of basis as we discourse on the philosophy of empiricism. The importance of science ways in dealing and the factor of different culture or language can also be tacit when we pursue a professional responsibility on this kind. It would be a studious and considerate process of evaluation and comparison involved with the prudence and stewardship of researchers (2002). At the stage of data collection, representatively within the in-depth interview, this kind of qualitative process within two actors -interviewers and interviewees -would occur, which follows by the coding, interpretation and analysis, but could be crippled for reasons – e.g., lack of effort to establish an empathy and rapport. It would likely be same as the case where the trial judge would be reprimanded for his short work on the evidence as a fact finder and his judgment can be reversed by the higher court. We also need to note that the impact of technological advances on the research professionals, of course, appear to be more extensive since the researcher generally comes more fore-fronted and less conservative. For example, we note new emerging technologies transform the traditional method of interview in the qualitative studies, which encompasses the phone, e-mail interview, voice of internet protocol (VoIP) and social media – skype, facebook and twitter chat.4 In this case, we would do good to practice in consideration of advantages and disadvantages of this method of data collection in terms of expense, time, flexibility and humanity, as well as the geographical and technical factors (Redlich-Amirav, Higginbottom, 2014). 4 There can we see the software programs (Apps) for SMDs; safari or google chrome (literature searches), Mendeley or Refwork (Manage References, quickly review probable document format files), PDFExpert or iAnnotatePDF (Read and annotate PDFs), Dropbox-\"cloud storage\" (store and backup PDFs), evernote (Create memoing, journaling, note-taking, and capturing textual, oral, visual, and temporal data, Dragon (Create memoing and journaling).

Chapter VIII Data Collection and Management A. From Kiyoung and Annette (a) An Example on the Coding Work As instructed, I had conducted an interview with one of my classmate according to the interview protocol and questions posted in the last week. The data of response was double checked with the notes taken during the interview and by using the audiotaped materials. That ensures of accuracy and precision that also was confirmed with the interviewees before it turns into a final version of transcripts below. As we see in this week website reference, there can we apply two types of hand coding work, i.e., type A and type B (2005). Type A requires that the researcher consider creating the codes a priori before ascribing to the main text. Type B requires getting through the interview transcript, but can be extracted from codes on a line-by-line basis created by the researcher that emerged from the interview. Type A demonstrates a more adaptation with general advice in this concern, i.e., first reading and memoing and coding next. Type A, in Kiyoung's view, can lead a more than complete exposure to the transcript assuming if the issues or questions of research are well cultivated so as to be mixed with the appreciation of data within the purview of researcher. You will identify eight codes and memos covering each question. You can also view the connection of codes in the diagram List of Codes Greatness (rich red) Sufferance (mild red) Education (rich blue) Support (mild blue) Success (rich yellow) Overcome (mild yellow) Excel (grey) Teacher (purple) The codes are a little more numerical than the traditional five to six queries. As we see, there are two traits in codes, one of which directly represents the verbatim of transcripts (Creswell, 2009). Another way is to maturate the understanding of text by repeated reading and memoing, and extract the applied words of abstraction to best boast the meaning of text. There are pros and cons with both ways, and the count of frequency in the latter case is generally less meaningful. The following picture shows the layers of analysis in this research. It could be combined with other data, and could possibly be developed to include the public administration in terms of structure to discipline. This also implies the importance of interdisciplinary studies within the research of social science. We also can note that the humans and community are fundamental units to be contested in yielding the truths of science, and pioneering role of philosophy to structure a thesis and dissertations. That is so if for our degree name, merely \"Ph.D.\" for the curriculum vitae of passing experts and \"Ph.D.\" in sociology\" or \"Ph.D.\" in public administration\" for scrupulous experts or professors. We may taste the kind of my tendency about an increasing semantic point, which seems, Kiyoung supposes, from the influence of qualitative studies. It may also be a tip of reflection for our career path. You will find that the interview transcripts be shown in each color to indicate the assigned code. Diagram Layers of Analysis Figure One Example of Coding Work on the Interview Result Interview Questions/Response/Memos/Coding 1. Please describe for me someone you admire, either a historical figure or someone alive today. Response: The person that I admire the most in life is a historical figure by the name of Oprah Winfrey. Oprah is an American media proprietor, talk show host, actress, producer, philanthropist and inspirational speaker. She is an African-American female and this nation's on black billionaire. Oprah is such a great person that words cannot sum up her goodness. She is a humanitarian and I truly believe that you can be no greater than that. She is always the first person to show love and stand and give others recognition for their great accomplishments in life overlooking her own. Memo: Oprah Winfrey is an African –American female, black billionaire, and one of greatest historical figure alive. She is truly humanitarian philanthropist and inspirational speaker with love and affection as well as open-mindedness to recognize others for their accomplishments. 1. Explain why you selected this person and why you admired this person. Response: I selected Oprah because she overcame all of the negative obstacles in her way. Oprah was born to a teenage, single mother who was economically challenged and who did not know how to properly raise a child because she was a child herself. Her father, who her mother claims was a one-night stand, was in and out of her life. During Oprah's first 6 years of life, her mother left her with her grandmother to raise her. Her grandmother taught her how to read by the age of 3, which is remarkable. I learned to read by the age of 4, so I have always been inspired by that in Oprah. Her grandmother also raised her in the church. Oprah moved back and forth between her mother and father for a number of years. Her mother was not as encouraging as her grandmother and worked as a maid for long hours not having much time to spend with her. Oprah was reportedly sexually abused by a cousin, an uncle, and a family friend. She later ran away at the age of 13 and ended up pregnant herself at the age of 14. Her son was born prematurely and passed away. Her father then took her to raise himself, and made education her number one priority. Oprah excelled in school winning numerous oratorical contests, and later became a television reporter. Oprah overcame numerous social problems (sexual abuse, single parent homes and upbringing, financial hardship, and bullying by her classmates because she was not the most attractive young girl and she did not have nice clothing) that plagued many economically challenged African-American families, but she was determined to excel and she did. Oprah proved that you can be what you want to be, and be successful in life if you put your heart and soul into it. Memo: She had poor life stories at her earlier age, born to a teenage and raised with the father and grandmother. She overcame the negative obstacles from her disparaged family lives, such as sexual abuse by the relatives and family friends and illicit pregnancy as well as death of her prematurely born son. Her grandmother is affectionate and concerned of her, who encouraged and supported her growth with education and religious piety. Oprah overcame such numerous social problems and achieved a brilliant success in the schools and her career engagement. She was determined to excel her black neighbors, who often are frustrated with such challenges of her sort. Oprah is a living legacy for the marginalized persons, such as some nomad professors in the CU. It sounds echoing \"you can be what you want be...of you put your heart and soul in it. 1. From him, what do you perceive or consider most important and consequential for his professional or life success? Response: I consider Oprah's characteristics that she exhibits to be the most important and consequential for her professional and life success. Characteristics and qualities that describe Oprah are love, trustworthiness, honesty, giving, caring, sharing, communication skills, ability to delegate, ability to listen, sense of humor, confidence, commitment, enthusiasm, positive attitude, creativity, intuition, and the ability to inspire others. It is because of these characteristics instilled in Oprah by her grandmother and father that she has rose to the level of success that she has today and influenced so many others in life positively. She has opened a school in Africa from which the first class has graduated and entered college. Education for Oprah is the key to success and positivity is the key to living a happy life. Memo: The characteristic and qualities that describe Oprah are diverse and really educative for the discouraged or challenged professionals, for example, love, trustworthiness, sharing, honesty and so on. It is relevant for the nomad professors to learn to improve his spirit and professional activities. For example, the teaching performance of nomad professors can relate with the communication skills or caring and sharing. As we see the role of grandmother and father, the senior professors and peers can support and instill leading to cultivate him to have good characteristics and qualities as a local professor. 1. From him, what do you perceive or consider most important and consequential for his good or bad social relationship? Response: Oprah chose to share her personal and intimate details about her life struggles with her weight, her love life, sexual abuse and tumultuous relationship with her mother as a form of therapy for American thus pushing us to talk about sensitive issues that many of us faced in life. Oprah taught us that no matter what we go through in life (positive or negative) that we must first love ourselves before we can love others. She taught us the true act of forgiving those that had wrong us is what will lead us to healthy and positive relationships in society. Memo : Despite her success, the social or family relationship had not always been idealistic. Her personal and intimate details about her life struggle ironically promoted her public discourse and intellectual sharing of Americans. Her tumultuous relationship may push to talk about the sensitive issues. As the nomad professor learns on life time and one of persons to be affected and inculcated, his or her status as a nomad professor may positively work to appreciate and cultivate as a more sensible professor than the settled groups. It also seems pertinent that love of oneself is the starting point since the success of nomad professors, in my view, depends on how much he or she loves a self in the fluid circumstances. 1. From him, what do you perceive or consider most important and consequential for his personal happiness or misfortune. Response: I have admired Oprah for a number of years, but last year on September 6-7, 2014, I have the privilege of attending the \"Oprah, It's Your Life\" convention in Atlanta, GA, and fell even more in love with her because of her positive outlook on everything in life and ability to inspire others to think and be positive. Through Oprah I have learned to love myself, that happiness comes from within, stay away from negative people because I refuse to internalize negativity, give freely to others, help when called upon and when I see a need to jump in and help, mentor to other young people, especially ladies, and speak good about others no matter what they may have done in life good or bad. Memo: Her tips of advice are also insightful in dealing with the issue of nomad professors. I consider it important for them to know that there are many of hard people and neighbors in predicament and challenges or difficulties. That seems an important condition if they wish to feel happy. Otherwise, they may more feebly be affected with the feel of misfortune and could not make themselves solid. The feel of affinity and association, and the action to realize it is consequential for the kind of persons. 1. Can you elaborate on some comparison of his personal attribute with the general expectation from the university professorship? Response: Oprah has given many some of the greatest advice on living a positive and happy life based on her life experiences both good and bad. She is an avid reader and lover of books and knowledge. Sometimes I look at Oprah and wonder why she has not attained her Ph.D. because she is by far one of the wisest and most influential people in America, not to mention one of the wealthiest in the world. It would benefit all, professors and students, to take a page out of Oprah's book on how to be successful in life. Giving to and sharing with others is what Oprah prides herself on and this is not just material things in life. Oprah believes that education comes first and sharing one's knowledge with others is what makes the world go around. We should all share what we have learned with others. I would compare Oprah to the late, Reverend, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Both of these individuals overcame adversity in their lives to rise to fame, but chose to use their positions in life to aid and benefit others in need. They never made issues about themselves, but about helping others to become the best that they could be and fight for the rights and privileges for all people of color. They are two of the world's most powerful and influential individuals. Dr. King fought for the rights of African-Americans, women, other minorities in a nonviolent manner by showing that no matter how one was treated or discriminated against, in his opinion love drives out all darkness, so loving you fellow brother and sister prevailed over all evil. Memo : The personal happiness or satisfaction is viewed in theories. One perspective emphasized the importance of innate characteristic or personality acquired from education or experience. Oprah shows it can be improved by one's self-train and reflexive attitudes. Learning and attention to the social issues or agendas seem to effect in her case that she is an avid reader and lover of books and knowledge. She is also innovative and has a creative attitude although she is not interested in PhD. She eventually became one of greatest teacher in the US. The quality of teacher is not merely from the professional qualification, but likely from the kind of relationship between the teachers and students. The origin of word, \"doctor\" means semantically \"license to teach\" in terms of Latin or French history, and we once have rated the quality of institutions by the ratio of holders of doctoral degree in the academic staff. Oprah surely makes an exception who can well outflank the normal Phds now in university teaching position. This may be in comparison with one of other great teacher in US, and they have such important traits as a teacher, \"overcame adversity,\" \" use their positions in life to aid and benefit others in need,\"\"helping others to become the best.\" It seems in rapport with the kind of attitude within the CU professors. They have a passion to breed the prospective, but economically not well to do class students. One professor once initiated a subsidies campaign from the salary money of law faculty, which now is in operation to manage the national exam preparation dormitory, named \"WKCK.\" (b) Reflections on the Coding Method Once we complete the interview, our next process turns on the data analysis and representation. The stage comprises major of four stages, say, organizing the data, describing, classifying and interpreting into codes and themes, and finally visualizing and representing the data. The process onto the stages is to move forth and backward centering at the codes and themes. I suggest that the codes and themes are the kind of \"landmark to bridge the truths of field into any scholarly construction\" to be published to the professional and civilized world. It is thus a nexus and liaison to connect the people or community with some scientific reality via a qualitative process of depersonalization.5 They are key tools of this process to 5 However, the data itself are such important as Michael Agar expounded in the Lively Science, \"Data linked to real human social worlds is where human social science, whatever else it does, has to start and has to finish.\" convert rare data emerged into the level of final narratives for reporting and publication. There can we identify three analytic strategies as Creswell guides, which were developed by Madison, Huberman & Miles and Wolcott (2009). Three views generally are not discrepant in conducting the best analysis strategies, but can have distinct points in some consideration. For example, the Huberman & Miles advised to count frequencies of codes, and Wolcott suggested highlighting certain information in description when the researcher begins by sketching the ideas (1994). Madison gave a dose that the researcher can best deal by creating a point of view \"for the scenes, audience and readers.\" Generally we can capture the kind of work flows which occurs in the data analysis and representation. That covers (i) sketching ideas (ii) taking notes (iii) summarizing field notes (iv) working with words (v) identifying codes (vi) reducing codes into themes (vii) counting frequency of codes (viii) relating categories (ix) relating categories into the analytic framework in literature (x) creating a point of view (xi) displaying the data. According to the Hubermas & Miles, \"Data analysis is not off the shelf; rather, it is custom-built, revised, and choreographed\" (1994). Dey also instructed that the data analysis fall back on three I's, to say, insight, intuition and impression (Creswell, 2009). The maxims subtle prove our expectation is true, concerning how we can get through the successful qualitative studies and what quality was entangled with ourselves. The qualitative researchers have to be exposed to the subject fully before he begins with the work. Patton especially shed a focus on the importance of pattern recognition.6 The exposure may, of course, usually would be associated with books and articles. It could also arise from his personal fate or long enduring experiences as a life subject. Once we had a chance to browse the qualitative dissertation of Walden about the illiterate-handicapped persons. Often scholar practitioners chose their topic from within their current occupation associated with the workplace challenges and improvement suggestions. They are the kind of well-versed person which even may compare with the professors in that field. I had studied the Korean issues and received a comment from the global peers that you are truly best qualified given you had been bred, live, learn, and experience daily with the kind of Korean chunk. It is cultural and highly own-flagrant so that we consider you any best to research the Korean society. Such sufficient exposure, whether from the books and articles indirectly or directly as in my case, could only saturate the maxims. Otherwise, the researchers would be strangers, not custom-built, or rather a cursory assembler than a choreographer. He may eventually turn to be an odd painter without duly analyzed data or themes which support his picture. The narrative in his research piece would be unorganized and unsupportive from the concrete evidence. Insight, intuition and impression are also the kind of traits that only could be developed with two types of exposure being propertied with the researchers. When I first open the website offered by one British university, the first video at left hand column displays two female researchers (2005). They are engaged with the beginning work to extract the possible codes on the interview result, which is obviously in a hurried breath and tense strains as well as moved voice. Apparently, insight, intuition, and impression were fully exercised to discuss the words of importance attended with a marking. They seem to be well exposed to their research frame and competently interact with the kind of significant words, such as school bullying. They also consider the frequency of words in the interview result. This experience inculcates with the kind of sense in the early morning fish market, who deals and 6 With a reference to Boyatrzis, he introduced \"the ability to use thematic analysis appears to involve a number of underlying abilities, or competencies. One competency can be called pattern recognition. It is the ability to see patterns in seemingly random information.\" This may be the kind of abstract skills differentiated from the knowledge of subject. However, the competencies seemingly cannot be totally independent among another. For example, the Korean researchers would often be superior of pattern recognition about the data of Korean sources, and medical doctors would be so with the data from the patients. sells it to the consumption at the dining table. The market managers and dealers had good eyes to discern the value of fish from their years of experience. They would rule out unedible or rotten fish, and in some cases flesh out a tasteful part for any precious dinner (Janesick, 2011). This presupposes their knowledge and experience as same with the work of qualitative researchers on the analysis of data. As Patterson illustrates, we may need to admire Hermes so as to be a precocious trickster and work hermeneutically to construct the knowledge (2002). In the data analysis, it needs to be noted that description comes first as followed by interpretation and the researchers get better to feel the Eureka moments through the iterative and tiring process of analysis. Initially five to six codes can be set, and may increase as much as 20 to 30 categories, and should finally be reduced again into five to six themes. This tiring work often could deplete the sense of points and be made lost within the sea of data. The Eureka moments are the kind of docking among the spaces, which only could be palpable with the well-exposed research professionals about the theme or meaning of field data and analysis. It preferably should be natural. If not, it has to be artificially pursued as a touchstone to testify the good progress on data analysis. As below, let me present the part of Annette's to enrich our class experience Annette chose to read the text from her 4 interviews, combine it, and create 8 codes based on similar themes and patterns that emerged from them. The codes that emerged were as follows: S (Supporter), E (Encourager), D (Definition of Admiration), L (Loving), S2 (Strength/Strong), P (Protector), P2 (Provider), and A (Appreciation). This type of coding is based on Bryman's four stages of qualitative analysis (Gibbs & Taylor, 2005). Regarding coding structure, Bryman suggests that you bracket passages or chunks of text in your transcripts/interviews and attach names or ideas represented by names to them as a way of representing the data (Gibbs & Taylor, 2005). Creswell (2013, p. 181) lists three general data analysis strategies which summarize the most effective ways to prepare and organize data, reduce data to themes through the process of coding and condensing codes, and finally representing the data in figures, tables, or narrative form. Annette chose to use Huberman\"s & Miles' (1994) approach to coding the data in her interviews which provided a much more detailed process of coding which included writing marginal notes and noting the similarities/relationship in themes, patterns, and ideas that emerged from the various interviews. The analysis of this experience proved to be more challenging for Annette, but the experience taught her to appreciate the thoughts of others and made her reflect on how when asking different individuals similar questions and then combining and constantly comparing the texts from each, how similar patterns, themes, and ideas emerge from all transcripts. This exercise was not easy and required an extensive amount of time to do thus proving that qualitative research can be quite detailed and difficult based on a massive amount of information/data collected. However, coding can be quite helpful and useful in deducing data and is an excellent method of organizing and categorizing information as a method of assisting the researcher in summarizing themes/patterns/ideas/meanings that it hopes to convey to its audience. It would be wise for the researcher to utilize a software program such as NVivo to aid in coding and reduce the stress and tension of hand coding massive amounts of data. B. On the Data Collection and Management Techniques (a) Qualitative Research and Data Collection According to Creswell, we can find four methods for collecting qualitative data, which covers the interviews, observations, and review of documents (Thomas, Nelson, Silverman, 2015). The data collection in the qualitative studies has several traits (i) the methodology is planned and pilot-tested before the study (ii) the researcher typically has some type of framework that determines and guides the nature of the data collection (iii) it is time-intensive process that should not be expected to be quick. The interview is undoubtedly the most common source of data in qualitative studies and we had an experience on the interview protocol and interview questions in the Mini-project. There are several types of interview including the person-to person-format as most prevalent, as well as group interviews and focus group. Although the interview is conducted in types including a highly structured style as used in the socio-demographic research and in which the questions is determined before the study, the qualitative researchers usually conduct an unstructured, open-ended interview and take interview notes or audiotape the interview and finally transcribe it. The kind of same activities occur in the focus group interview, and the technology allows the interviewer to conduct different types of interviews, in which e-mail, face-to-face, focus group, online focus group and telephone can be put to use (2015). Being a good interviewer requires skills and experience; (i) Complete rapport should be established that they know each other and trust one another (ii) the interviewer has to create the atmosphere and condition the respondent believes that he or she can talk freely (iii) the interviewer asks the right questions and practices the value of using various approaches, for example, beginning to ask less sensitive questions (iv) skillful interviewing can be grown with training, for example, video-taping your own performance in conducting an interview, observing experienced interviewers, role playing, and critiquing peers; (v) the interviewer makes sure that he appear non-judgmental, be alert to both verbal and non-verbal messages and be flexible to rephrase or pursue to clarify, use the clear and meaningful words, and be a good listener (2015). We also recommend that video-tape recording seems to be best method because it could allow to capture and to preserve both of verbal response and non-verbal behavior of interviewees. Nevertheless, the drawback is not inconsiderable that the machines can malfunction at any time, can create awkward and intrusive impression. This makes its use infrequently than taking notes. It often would be ineffective and least preferred that the interviewer tries to remember the interview responses and writes down afterward what was said in the interview. In my qualitative plan, the 13-17 interviews are planned to be conducted in which most of occasions will be person to person format and e-mail or telephone interviews might be alternative to supplement against the challenges and difficulties during the operation of research schedule. The kind of guidelines explored to make the interviews a best practice will be kept through the completion (Laureate Education Inc., 2010b). The examination of documents will be another important way of data collection since the issues of nomad professor could be unraveled more extensively by examining the school record and newspapers or campus communications. Keeping a journal during the research study will also provide a crucial part of evidence to be incorporated into the analysis of data and visualization or presentation (Emerson, Fretz, Shaw, 1995). For the key participants, it would be trusted to keep a journal or diary during the research study, in which they play the role likely same as collaborator in the field work. Some participants will be asked to contribute the personal letters for the use of data, which also can be precious to understand their true and life moment of experiences or feelings. Official memos of campus leader and dean of departments, minutes from the meeting of faculty board, records of teaching and research performance, and archival material for rewards and disciplines as well as the accomplishment of NPs within the administrative position over period would be a source of data that constitutes the data collection method in my study. Observation is another way to collect the data in my qualitative research and field notes are taken throughout the observations with a focus on what is seen. The issue of observation method would challenge since it requires a prolonged amount of time in the setting and could possibly be obtrusive although it would be the secondary nature of data collection to complement with the interview result for the effect of impression and highlight of focused viewpoints (van Manen, 1990). One recommendation is that the researcher has to prepare so as not to be a stranger with a pad and pencil or camera. I would be more active to be a participant and will gather field notes by conducting an observation as participant rather than non-participant. It also is a good idea to schedule for a pilot visit a couple of days before the initial data collection since it could facilitate the process for the participants to become accustomed to having the researcher around. It is expected of several artificial and natural settings for observation to consummate at reports of what goes on when a visitor is present. The observation could render the researcher to cost time and energy, for example, obtaining a permission and schedule to arrange, and emergency to change his plan so that it is not desirable to take it longer so as to make the visitors considered no longer a novelty. Other possible data collection method has been summarized in the box form below, which is flexible about its implementation depending on the iterative process to find its needs. The reactivity to employ those various methods would be developed gradually according to the stage of my qualitative studies. Figure 1 Other Data Collection Methods The Studies on Nomad Professors and Data Collection Sources of data  Self-reports of knowledge and attitude  Development of scenarios  Interpretation of Participants in Observation Recording Devices  Notebooks, narrative field logs, diaries, printed materials (course syllabi, team rosters, evaluation reports, participant notes, photographs) (b) Considerations on the Data Management A data management plan is an integral part of the research plan and it is underscored that main principles and procedures have to be considered earlier in the research stage, which should not remain unresolved until the data collection begins at the latest. In the qualitative research on NPs, it has been consulted well in advance when the research design completed. It is important to acknowledge that the good scientific practice can be ensured of the compliance with the ethics of research and data management techniques. For example, the data have to be kept safe and secure at all stages of research, and the researchers are required to make it available for the subsequent researchers as a matter of professional standard. The data management plan generally would be common over both methods, but could come in subtlety of differences between the quantitative and qualitative methods.7 In many cases over 7 In the quantitative studies, the scope of points in the data management plan should be checked conventionally countries, the ethical review process would comprise the stage of research operation with the public code or regulations so that the researchers need to assure of its standard. University websites are a popular source to obtain instructions about the permissible and impermissible research practice as exemplified in the institutional research review board instituted as a matter of federal regulation in the US. A data management plan addresses several important questions during the research, i.e., how research data are collected or created, how data are used and stored, and how made accessible for others after research has been completed. Figure 2 Qualitative Research and Data Management Plan8 Data Management Plan The Data  What kinds of data are collected or generated?  In what way are data collected or generated? [As discussed, the interview results are a primary source of data which unravel, in depth, the personal, social and professional aspect of their lives. It would yield a sociopsychological quality of data which will be analyzed and developed to assert on the implications of my discipline, i.e., public policy and administration. The photos, journal writings or diaries and review summaries of documentation would come as another type of data. The 13-17 interviews will be conducted/ around 100 photos will be stored/over 200 pieces of other data types will be stored] Rights  Who owns the copyright, intellectual property rights and management rights to data?  Who has the right to grant access to data?  What procedures are used to inform research participants? [The participants and campus administration would be a usual owner of data which the researchers are interested in and intends to collect. In some cases, the data source is protected of copyright or intellectual property -as concerned of mail survey -including the dataset description. processing, standards and metadata, ethics and privacy, data sharing, and archiving and preservation. For example, data will be processed and analyzed using SPSS, and the direct identifiers of respondents will be stored separately from the data and will be destroyed after the anonymised dataset has been checked and validated. 8 Adapted to the Finish Social Science Archive (2015). rights despite a scarcity because of vastly unofficial nature of data. In that case, a due process of law will be taken to manage the data plan permissibly. The informed consent is vital part to validate the data collection process. The consent form will be provided well before the data collection activities occur. Hence a sufficient time is allowed for informed meditation and voluntary participation. The informed consent form utilized in my qualitative studies will follow] Confidentiality and Data Security  How is confidentiality of data ensured?  What kind of rights different user groups have to access and process data files?  How is data security ensured?  How are back-ups of data files handled? [The confidentiality and security of data are important points of consideration since the privacy or business secret and falsification of data have to be forestalled if under the control of researcher (Corti, Day, Backhouse, 2000). The data will have a paper-back version once completed to be gathered, and kept in the locker stand or the study of researcher's home. The e-mail account is another effective way to ensure against the loss of data. The password and secret code for the security of data will be good to protect the data unless the kind of extreme mishap, such as hacking, happens. The key participants will be allowed access as need arises which is inextricable to conduct the research plan. In this case, the change of password may do increase a security in cases] File Formats and Programs  What software programs are used to store and process data?  What file formats and storage media are used? [We had an experience of hand-coding, and there can we identify a variety of computer software programs to facilitate the need and convenience of qualitative research. NVivo is one of popular programs and will benefit the research on the NPs in the Alpha University. The NVivo has an extent of abilities to store various file formats in which my use will be on the pdfs, photo files and htlm.] Documentation and Data Processing Content  How is the technical quality of data ensured?  How are data processing methods documented?  Where are metadata describing data collection methods and data content stored? [NVivo has powerful tools to store and analyze the collected data. The nodes will centralize the theme interviews, for example. It provides the technical quality of data as excellent. For example, the frequency display of codes can be presented in graphics, and the raw data can be automatically restructured to show the importance of themes. The use of NVivo as conditioned by the acceptable field work as well as quality and amount of data can lead to virtually automatic generation of researcher's narratives he wished to deliver. Life Cycle  What happens to data after research has been finalized? [The data should be kept as confidential and secure after research has been finalized. This means that the researchers are required to comply with the professional or legal standard of practice. It is a good practice since the subsequent researchers could benefit and also for the public and professional reasons, such as needs to prove authenticity or falsification by the participants, government and professional community. It may not be such longer as ten or fifteen years, but normally one to three years as stipulated according to the jurisdictions and professional associations] (c) Computer Aided Programs and Use of NVivo NVivo is a qualitative data analysis computer software program produced by QSR international, and exciting to store and analyze the collected data on the research of NPs in the CU University (Weitzman & Miles, 1995). As we are aware, the tutorials have been progressed over the weeks in this course, and we acquired a basic knowledge and kills how to use it, for example, creating the project of qualitative research, incorporating the data into the program files, and deal with the magic of nodes to analyze the field data, such as interview results, photos, interne files, and so on. We also will be requested to present some piece of evidence, such as screenshot of NVivo, to demonstrate its use. Since my qualitative plan is based on the extent of field data, the hand-coding method imposes challenges in terms of efficient handling of research project. NVivo has a scope of useful functions that provide an ease and convenience for the qualitative researchers, which is not an exception in my case also. NVivo is used predominantly by academic, government, health and commercial researchers across a diverse range of fields.9 Generally, the computer assisted qualitative data analysis software is used in a wide purpose and convenience, which provides an automation for transcription analysis, coding, text interpretation, recursive abstraction, content analysis, discourse analysis, and grounded theory methodology, and so on (1995). Two types of software are publicly available. One is free or open source software, which currently numbers roughly around 12 types, such as Aquad and TAMS Analyzer. There is a proprietary software that provides a service on the paid basis, which amounts around14 currently, including NVivo, Annotations, and CAT. We also can encounter several webbased software programs, such as computer aided textual markup & analysis (1995). NVivo is one of most patronized software in this context that NVivo 10 for windows offers a range of new features and enhancements, which facilitates my qualitative research plan. For example, I may order transcripts of my media files from within NVivo, and can collect the data on just about my mobile device, who now uses IPad. I may also be needed to import the data from Twitter, Facebook posts, YouTube Videos and comments, which is enabled by NCapture. My qualitative research plan would be staffed with web pages and online PDFs, which can be processed by NCapture. It is especially attractive to suit to handle my qualitative research plan that it handles virtually any data, including word documents, PDFs, pictures, database tables, spreadsheets, audio files, videos, social media data and web pages. I will firstly choose the working language, and store my project database and research materials as a single file, which will make my project completely portable. In use of NVivo, it is important to make sure that the researcher makes sense of collected information. I will fully benefit from NVivo's powerful query tools to uncover subtle trends, while the automated analysis features also facilitate a quick test of theory. It is useful to track my ideas and steps with ease, and enables to share my findings with others without retyping or reformatting. (d) Reflections As we see, the in-depth interview enables to collect the evidence, which is crucial since it constitutes a database making the research creative and original. As we are gotten, the significance and use depend on the trait of disciplines and the selection to deal with the type of research method-quantitative v. qualitative--and various approaches of qualitative studies would also be one factor that the researchers have to exercise for the best fit (Creswell, 2013). The sort of data collection also needs to be contemplated once he became determined about the method and approach. For example, the types of collected data can be comprehensive in the case studies while those may be limited if you choose in the narrative research. One of most popular and positive source of information often is drawn from the interview results if in the qualitative studies. We have conducted an interview in the frame of Mini Project, which was processed according to the interview protocol and questions. It would be the kind of difficult process to tease out the new source of useful materials out of 9 It had basically been purported to assist with the social scientists so that the researchers within anthropology, psychology, communication and sociology are patrons of the program, and the kind of practical fields of interest are much helped to encompass, among others, forensic, tourism, criminology and marketing. the crust, which gradually came in rapport with the focus of interviewers and adapted to facilitate. Upon completion, the researcher would claw his way back to face with the collected interview result, and will tuck himself into various aspect of his research plan to evaluate the collected data (Patton, 2002). The kind of inquest will occur, \"Are they rich enough to support his theme, or anything left unlearned, and the ways to make it fitted with my frame of research.\" The kind of weaning process to elevate for the level of scholarly field will gradually start relating with his initial embracement or roadmap anticipated in the stage of research design. With his raw data, the senior or deceased scholars and authority either in philosophy, or in his specific discipline and often with the mixed influence of both, will guide, forge and help to analyze the phenomenon and research questions. This is the trait I suppose to name the degree, \"PhD\" or \"PhD in [specific discipline]\" as once pointed elsewhere. In some cases, the research may be done without the raw data, in which the kind of process occurs only with the scholarly interchange. One example might be if the rendering of new case by the Supreme Court in the last moment about gay marriage would spark the taste of legal researchers to write the law review articles and provide an analysis with the precedents, as well as criticism or supportive message. Of course, the issue may require of the need of more empirical evidence -I like to say \"more empirical\" if the new case or other references themselves can be viewed as \"empirical\" though indirect -which impulses the researcher to collect the data utilizing the survey or in-depth interviews. Alternatively, he may satisfactorily draw upon to use the existing statistics already collected by the public poll since it can operate as good to support his proposition or argument. The kind of intermingling with the existing authority is an important process to escalate the elegance and persuasion of research activity, and the kind of distinct dimension between the scholarly and common reporting. It requires a conscience and good scholarship to evaluate fairly and persuasively. For example, it should not be the practice as a subterfuge to the interest of political majority or his funding institutions. The researcher should not be merely a pundit missing or eclipsing the implicating or even important evidence. He would preferably be a spug as competent to be saturated among the sea of complexions within the data, literature review, his research frame, and scholarship. Once I stressed the basic exposure of researcher overall within the research process and how it importantly impacts on the data analysis, which would be a stage of highlight so as to place him as professional researcher. And it also may be testifiable to reflect how the researcher could experience the Eureka moments between the authority or influence and his raw experience (2012). It not only could be present, but also should be present to complete the level of scholarly product. References Corti, L. Day, A., Backhouse, G. (2000).

Chapter IX Data Analysis Techniques A. General Note on the Data Analysis Techniques (a) Introduction The data analysis technique is constantly evolving, not a static repository with typical methods. For example, Eaves YD suggests that the synthesis approach in the ground theory could increase understanding and enhance the quality of GT data analysis techniques (2012). While he noted that there has been a steady rise in the number of published research reports that use the GT method, he viewed that the current method in prevailing use lacks the clarity and inconsistencies. It is needless to mention in the field of natural science that researchers reported a new data analysis technique to rapidly identify the region of stable crack growth in crack tip opening angle (CTOA) testing of a modified double cantilever beam (Hashemi, Dastani, Sadri, 2013). The method could replace for the visual analysis of the individual photographs, which is tedious and rather lengthy. This implies that the data analysis is considered in terms of cost and convenience of researchers in common with both sciences. The data analysis technique also occurs involved with the literature review which represents the most important step of the research process in all three methods of social science. Boote and Beile expounded, \"A thorough, sophisticated literature review is the foundation and inspiration for substantial and useful research.\" Therefore it is the kind of crucial concern of qualitative researchers how to construct a research synthesis aptly. In this context, four types of data in connection with the five qualitative data analysis techniques have been studied by three scholars, who drew on any most optimally rigorous way concerned of literature review (Onwuegbuzie, Leech, Collins, 2012). This study implies the relevance of data analysis technique with the literature review, which are inseparable, but into the research synthesis and on iterative process among the data and literature. (b) Techniques of Qualitative Data Analysis According to Merill et al, the techniques of qualitative data analysis are commonly shared among the approaches, which includes (i) documentation of the data and the process of data collection (ii) organization/categorization of the data into concepts (iii) connection of the data to show how one concept may influence another (iv) corroboration/legitimization, by evaluating alternative explanations, disconfirming evidence, and searching for negative cases (v) representing the account (reporting the findings) (2000). It is grossly intertwined with the collection and documentation of data, and it is important to note that the data analysis actually begins at the time of observation, interviewing or both. The researchers always get the data as central for validity and reliability of research that analytic process bases by simply hinging on the notes or transcripts with repeated reading (Kvale, 2006). The concept could be the kind of oasis sublimating the raw data into a cohesive scientific message that he or she creates by organizing and categorizing the data into concepts. Important is the need to develop the relationship or hierarchy of concept that is essential to structure his theme and produce a due density of scholarly presentation as normalized to the intelligence of audience, perhaps, supervisor of dissertation or referees and peers of professional journal. In this process, they may use the concept map. Then the positive steering from the raw data into major profile of assertions would likely be completed that the researchers will make an enhancement of theme with corroboration and legitimization (2000). He or she evaluates alternative explanations or discuss disconfirming evidence and may search for negative cases. This may simply show the process to deal with the data, but would be most important technique to be minded for my research plan on the NPs of Alpha University. There will be a tack of collected data in the form of observed results or interview transcriptions as well as public or private documents. The photos and video materials were not planned at this stage, but the possibility of inclusion is not unlikely along the development of theme. We have surveyed the benefit of NVivo last week, and the data storage and analysis would obviously be facilitated with such modern technology. At the center of dynamism does lie the codes, themes or concepts that important statement of participants should not be missed or gone as unattended. Weakly team meetings among the key participants and researcher will be arranged that keys on the progress of research including the evaluation and analysis of data. As once stated, documentation from the interviews and observations of sites, photos, and videos are a major form of data source to represent the empiricism that requires a care and focus for management and analysis. Miles and Huberman proposed useful tools named the summary contact form that shows the flow model of qualitative data analysis components, which are applicable to my research plan (Creswell, 2013). For example, on the occasion to observe the residence of nomad professors, I may prepare the contact summary form structured with the flow of relevant questions or points of consideration i.e., (i) what were the main issues or themes that struck you in this contact (ii) summarize the information you got (or failed to get) on each of the target questions you had for this contact (iii) anything else that struck you as salient, interesting, illuminating or important in this contact (iv) what new (or remaining) target questions do you have in considering the next contact with this site (Merill et al, 2000). In consideration of analysis technique, a considerable amount of data may be produced in Korean, and I may think how the translation into English language is viewed. It would be no seldom for researchers given the scope of deals in the international case studies or ethnography and narrative studies of significant person. The website of Johns Hopkins University provides a tip on this interest (2015). At first, it needs to be determined whether to translate or not, in which the researchers consider various factors, such as logistical,10 validity,11 customer, ownership and control, and implicit or unintended message from the original data (2015). The researcher also considers the benefit and drawback of translation. For example, the researcher may plan to conduct the data collection in English which obscures the issue originally, and the multi-sites investigation often allow to have a common language for analysis. Most of all, he has to know that the interpretation is very time consuming. The common view is that the translation leads the raw data or theme to be too literal and insipid, which may, in some case, be inaccurate as differs from the original nuance or authentication of phenomenon. The translation of raw data into language within the process of analysis and publication also entails a delicate problem of privacy or indecency with no use at all. In that case the research may use \"Do Not Translate List,\" which includes, for example, words for friend or friendship, words for HIV, or terms referring to the act of sexual intercourse (2015). (c) Application to the Research Plan In using the techniques of data analysis for my research plan, I have considered a scope of methods that are of types to deal with the specific context of research and sorts of 10 For example, he inquires of how much time it will take. 11 For example, he considers how much time it will take, if the translation is accurate, if the original meaning is distorted, or if anything is omitted? qualitative approaches. Let me present 15 methods as compiled by D. Ratcliff and some possibilities to facilitate my case.12 Interestingly, the difference of methods is just a matter of extent and would not be so rigid, but versatile that can be applied across the type of five qualitative approaches. To say, my research can be classed as a case study, but many helpful tips arise from the methods regardless of its prominent use within certain other approaches. For example, the photo data of an empty parking lot in the Alpha University may be analyzed in narration with the semiotics that can be parceled into my themes. The discourse and narrative analysis as well as hermeneutics would be used to analyze the interview result collected from the nomad professors, deans of department, housewife of NPs, as well as settled peers (Ratcliff, 2015). Also noteworthy is it that data analysis can benefit much from the computerized software programs, for example, use of nodes in NVivo, coding of various sorts of data, or coding matrix as combined with the quantitative data. The text search query is fairly implicating to construct the theme. Given it being assigned for this weekend, I may brief on two methods of data analysis to illustrate my case of qualitative research. The typology is a method that is principled and often embedded within the attitude of qualitative researchers. It includes the elements often centered on the work frame of researcher, such as a classification system or categories and is taken from pattern and themes or other kinds of groups of data. The interview results and other data collected from the field work in my case can be winnowed into categories or classification (2015). The constant comparison is widely used and developed in late 1960's, and especially applicable to the grounded theory. The method requires a researcher to look at document, such as field notes, which is considered central and as a basin of generating a new theory (Sanjek, 1990). He also looks for indicators of categories in events and behavior, as well as compares codes to find consistencies and differences, in which NVivo has strength with automated process of analysis. Also the kinds of frame between consistencies and differences must be minded as we see the five stages of qualitative analysis method above, and the consistencies are led into categories in terms of methodology. In this work of constant comparison, the researcher will know that the memo on the comparisons and emerging categories is indispensable, and helps to clearly organize the structure and content of data on the theme of nomad professors. Also to be minded is that the category has to be exhaustively striped until no new codes related to it are formed. The researcher, then, would assess if certain categories deserve more central focus that is often drawn upon axial categories or core categories. The applications to my study had come in summary with the following table. Table Data Analysis Method and Nomad Professors Methods Applications to the Research Plan Typology  Four categories will be developed from the themes and research questions  The nodes and hierarchy of codes will be utilized.  Identity of NPs Frequent Traveler Professorship 12 The fifteen methods in his list encompasses, typology, taxonomy, constant comparison, analytic induction, logical analysis or matrix analysis, quasi-statistics, event analysis or microanalysis, Metaphorical analysis, domain analysis, hermeneutical analysis, discourse analysis, discourse analysis, semiotics, content analysis, phenomenology or heuristic analysis, and narrative analysis.

Productivity or Efficiency Oriented (d) An Epilogue Once we had been about the extended use of qualitative method in the studies of US government, and the kind of tendency has increasingly emerged over time in Korea. The newspapers highlight the importance of story-telling or episode relating with the public policy of government. The entitlements of aged people had been implemented last year, a hyperbole to be fought in the national assembly as concerned of the fiscal feasibility and social justice along the increasing restructuring into the aging society. Korean cable TV channels are in wide coverage and one of them, named KTV, deals with the specialty of national policy. In one program aired yesterday, several aged people had featured and gave their narrative or words of graceful experience for the provision of entitlements. The amount is as small as 200 dollars a month, but had impacted likely astronomically for the poor aged persons. The administrators or policy makers would learn during the course of their official duty. It is their trait, and most vigil than any other commoners. The top managers in the nation-owned enterprises may reflect like a person in the temple stay, one learning process on meditation. A tedious head of department may shame with his small of public activities that he likes to read and learn humans or community and wisdom for his responsibility (Patton, 2002). Most aids would be received from his working horses in the active rank and files that he would rather be enthralled as philosophical, humanistic, and communitarian than specifics. The learning occurs and essentially undergirds the contemporary society. The tendency is more impressive that the congressmen or policy makers in the executive are in the vortex of that reality. They would also be creators at least in the Korean context, as we know from Y.S. Kim in the 1990's, announcing that now is the age of life-time learning. It likely shows how we are related among another. Above all, the importance of their learning lies in the fact that it is not merely cultural or the kind of personal enrichment. It also is not such personal if we gird the ignorant or absent minded congressmen. It is crucially trusted with the paradigm of deliberative democracy. They have to shape their competence and be required to come with the exposure to the humans and community. The reelection possibility would be one motivating factor to push them to learn and to have awareness that we see them to be politically responsible. It was cited in the recent Korean source that Obama had the character of policy wonk, who would be an avid of every aspect of policy issues and agendas. This is no surprise at all when we consider his role and responsibility. Needless to illustrate the marginalized and greatest approach or purposeful sampling in the qualitative studies, the contrast often is quite useful to create the views or frames of social issues. The poverty and superrich would be one frame embedded with the intellectuals along the growth rate of economy. The kind of frame is also an avenue to testify the effect of policy programs or project as we see in the aged persons featuring in the KTV. It also demonstrates a continuing relevance with the lifetime learning that humans and community are inseparable or subjects of which politicians are fated. The kind of relationship or public tendency likely ascends as we are informed by the post-modernism, technology advancement and trajectory toward the informative society or creative economy. Now we seldom give a focus on the manufacturing, once the point of contest for the world economy. The kind of rhetoric, world factory, is now the second title for the world economy, and the middle class within such income range perhaps would be less stimulating or likely approach dormant for the policy makers. They likely remain with them as main and appear to be illusive of an expectation of same consequence in their thought or public process. That probably would not be wrong at least if we are simple and honest of economic aspect of their lives. The economy is powerful indeed-and perhaps most urgent for humans -if it is only field to enlist in the Nobel prize from the social science. The Thomson Reuter reports the SSCI statistics that separately classes from social science to deal with the Economics and Business along the general social science in total. Hence, we may safely defer to their assumption of middle class, perhaps common and generalized, if we are lovers of human. I do not argue for the use of qualitative research more widely for the public studies or suggest the cut of qualitative studies since the middle class is quite good at all. Humans are complex as we note in the Maslow's and we draw the data from the subjects in the qualitative method. We had got through the data collection and their analysis now is staged, which obviously is very important to elevate the research plan. While humans are complex, only way to collect the data stems from his or her expression, hence, the kinds of occurrences, i.e., observation and interviews, documents (Creswell, 2013). While man may not be exactly the expression of his or her statement, the coding lesson generally highlights such importance of \"significant statement\" to understand and analyze the data (Kvale, 2006). In the KTV, I had a moment of fantasia that one policy can create such significant words and statements not only from the interviewees and but also from the producers. To say, the title tears with impressive words, \"Faith of Sons and Daughters,\" which seemingly is effective in struggling with the growing criticism as compared with the unemployment rate of young college graduates. The statements from the interviewees are capturing indeed with one aged male, 68 years old, who has no job expressing the savory support of small money in his later life. He seems still robust to work in the construction site, but the age actually impedes to turn away every opportunity for earned work. The statutory retirement age or pension plan of nations can be the work of \"quantitative researcher,\" but must be inadequate for this person in my observation and according to his statement. Next hours shortly, the acting prime minister and head of business association featured in the press meeting that announced the policy programs and basic direction to improve the unemployment problem of young generations. Actually they learn and would be best to craft various policy measures. They would be ombudsman to report and assess as well as rule that are most needed of and exposed to the creative knowledge beyond the textbooks. In other words, the kind of case studies and grounded theory would likely work, and must be necessary for them as well as the government, one of biggest employers within the nation and perhaps major employer of professional researchers. While conducting a qualitative research as one of important instruments to staff the knowledge of government in the US – gradually within the context of Korea and other nations -we need to have a thought why the research findings are seldom adopted to enforce. On the progress of course, I also come to wake up if two persons with 100,000 dollars a year as their income are absolutely same deserving a good livelihood award and what are differences between top GDP country per capita and \"perfect\" or \"graceful\" from the words of interviewees collected from the research project dealing with the middle income earners of the top nation (Patton, 2002). B. The Qualitative Data Analysis and Application (a) A Thought on Principles and Techniques The trait of qualitative research requires of an establishing a strong foundation for qualitative analysis that also leads to the coding principles as any more important for productive and valuable project. That is, the good ideas about how to focus the study and analyze the collected data have to come together with our skills and diligence of observation and interviews. Although the purpose drives analysis is one of extreme method in terms of data analysis technique, it shows the importance of data in the qualitative method, and also guides the coding work along the purposive sampling in the same context (Patton, 2002). The design frames analysis comes a little objectively that design decisions anticipate what kind of analysis will be done. The kind of characteristic underlain within the qualitative research relates with the coding analysis that we consider the concept map, hierarchy of codes, and code matrices, and coding structure. Once the deceased president M. H. Noh sighed, \"there are no staffs who share a code with me.\" He might be one of fateful president, who perhaps is a unique president in Korea or possibly in the world for his suicide in 2007. His remark eloquently shows the qualitative character of humans if within the dimension although his statement might be on his policy orientation and personal ambition to lead the nation. Brown, in her article featured in Forbes, wrote about her thought and experience learning how to code (2015). The Forbes also foretold that the Codeacademy will be a next frontier in the digital education movement. In her comment, we can see her mental process about the nature of learning or especially that, how to code, that it is more flexible, subjective or contextualized as well as dimensional or evaluative.13 The illustrations show the quality of code or coding and its universalized application to humans and society which is typically implicative of trending society toward the post-modernism or queer theory and feminism. In these strands, we can possibly draw some of coding principles or strategies. The coders have to contemplate in advance (i) what is going on (ii) what are people doing (iii) what is the person saying (iv) what do these actions and statements take for granted (v) How do structure and context serve to support, maintain, impede or change these actions and statements (Gibbs & Taylor, 2005). It is truly deep with the human elements, and participatory with the researcher or coder. The evidence is collected through various methods as dimensional and with a depth, and the role of coder enables to make it qualitative and eventually thematic. The coder also knows what to 1313 She begins \"the internet is aflutter with the New Year resolution 'learn how to code.\" He continues, \"I applaud anyone that wants to learn something new. The problem with this viral goal is that it's not specific and doesn't include any measurements (nature of learning).... It makes me think of the time I wanted to learn how to speak Mandarin but had never set foot in China. Needless to say, it probably makes more sense for me to learn Spanish as I live in Los Angeles (subjective or contextualized)... but if you signed up to learn how to code because you think it might solve some problem you are having, you should probably noodle on that a bit more (flexible). I'm taking a few online classes from Stanford including CS 101 as a refresher so I can be a better instructor and mentor (dimensional or evaluative). Those are motivational reasons to learn how to code.\" be coded that encompasses a scope of various objects and occurrences incomparable with the quantitative data, to list some, behaviors, specific acts events (short once in a lifetime events or things people have done that are often told as a story), activities (these are of a longer duration, involve other people within a particular setting), strategies (practice or tactics), states (general conditions experienced by people or found in organizations, and meanings (a wide range of phenomena at the core of much qualitative analysis). Meanings and interpretations are important pars of what directs participant's actions. The coding is based on the four elements, i.e., themes and topics, ideas and concepts, terms and phrases, and keywords that are humanistic, qualitative and hierarchical than are manifested in the quantitative studies (2005). It is inductive, however, as to be interrelated with the raw data that coding is the process of combining the data for any meaning structure and content in which a code label or meaningful names to underpin the ideas or concepts are used to facilitate coherent work system or automated flow of qualitative investigation. We can benefit much to make comparisons, to identify the patterns, to grow more topics or themes to become apparent, to identify the issues with the codes list (Creswell, 2013). When the researcher starts coding, two ways stand that a priori and grounded codes are used. A priori codes literally stems from a previous research or theory in vast cases, but the range of sources could include research or evaluation questions the researcher is addressing, questions and topics from the interview schedule, and the gut feeling about the data or the setting. In the codes of grounded theory, the data is a unique source to code since the researcher likes to put aside prejudices, presuppositions and previous knowledge of the subject area and generate new themes or theory by concentrating instead on the data. In terms of types, we can apply two methods what are called descriptive coding and analytical coding (2013). In the first type, the researcher addresses the pattern of what is in the transcript or text, and results in the end to form a summary description. The analytical or theoretical coding occurs when the codes are based on the analytical thinking about the \"why question\" involved with the events, occurrences and phenomenon enshrined within the data or information. In exercising the coding query, the hierarchical coding or tree coding is usual way to structure the theme or generate the relationships or classification of categories or concepts, terms and so. It involves a branching arrangement of sub-codes and stands on the thought between the parents and the kinds of progenies, \"examples of...\" \"contexts of...\" \"causes of...\" \"settings for...\" and so on. The idea is such as \"friendship types\" or \"changes in friendship\" that we consider the kind of feels and analogy among the data and qualitative information \"close or generalized\" \"making new friends\" \"new same sex friends\" \"new different sex friends\" \"losing touch\" \"becoming sexual relationship\" and so (Gibbs & Taylor). As we note, the qualitative data analysis is iterative and constantly evolving that we need to create new codes during the process. In occasions, NVivo displays the sign asking if to store as a new node or new codes. This requires that you need to check the units of data you coded pervious to creating the new codes. Upon creation of new code, you can, of course, apply new codes to whole data set. Ryan & Bernard in a recent paper suggest a number of ways to identify the themes and codes, such as word repetitions, key words in context, and on14 (b) Application and an Example 14 While drawing heavily upon Strauss and Corbin, they suggest many others including compare and contrast, social science queries, searching for missing information, metaphors and analogies, transitions, connectors, unmarked text, pawing, and cutting and sorting. In working on the codes and analysis, I was recalled on the data analysis spiral that Creswell guided (2013). At an early stage in the analysis process, researchers typically organize their data into computer files, and that certainly is my case that PDFs, interview results and types of data were brought into the \"Internal\" as NVivo labeled. They initially were compiled in my folders of PC, and termed as \"External.\" That was very easy task and the first step to begin the computerized analysis. From his data process frame, I found the end result to come first that representing and visualizing are the point of fantasy which culminates in the form of matrix or trees and propositions can be clarified. \"Describing, Classifying and Interpreting\" are toilsome and recurring through the classifications of data and nodes that constitute the main work of data analysis. The contexts, categories and comparisons are formulated and described that gradually emerge into themes or meaningful stories. The process is important to reflect the thought process and values or beliefs of researcher, in which the service and facility of NVivo are clustered and intrigued to provide (Kelle, 1995). As you see later, the screenshots attached display some of result over the flow of weekly lessons during the application of my research project into the NVivo. Under this background information concerned of principles, techniques, and process, let me present a part of application to my research plan on the nomad professors. Figure Application of Principles to the Research Plan Principles Some Aspect of Applications Good Ideas to Focus the Study and Analyze the Data This principles and considerations are foundational when we think of qualitative research in general. Since the research has to be original and creative, the raw data are a crucial component, but never convey any meaningful stories or contexts for themselves. It is important to create a focus which constitutes an essential feature of data analysis. The research questions and existing literature as well as data itself are a basin to pursue a focus or lens of analysis. I may have developed five points of study focus, which covers identity of NPs, professional, social, personal and public administration. It basically relied on the research questions, and alluded to the needs of discipline. In the process, I have used the Ryan and Bernad's social science queries, for example, that the general goals of discipline, such as efficiency or productivity and new thought on the focus of organizational members are included to make a theme. Five Vantage Points to Consider (i) What is going on: I have considered the continued trend of associated campus community and every aspect of campus lives, and businesses are progressing with the factors of importance, i.e., NPs and settled professors, the kind of contrast to be divulged. The kinds of code arise, say, travel, settle, interested, disinterested, participation, alone and so. (ii) What are people doing: I assumed that they perform their professional duty, and manage their personal and social lives. They enjoy a tenure or may hurry to arrange the local residences upon the recruitment decision. Some may feel retarded so as to return to basics and fundament. The kinds of coding arise, such as leadership, excel, resilience and so. (iii) What is the person saying: We can collect the data generated from in-depth interviews within the NVivo label of \"Sources,\", for instance, deans of department, NPs, their wives and local lecturers. The kinds of coding arise, say, despair, sufferance, overcome, success, excel, and on (iv) What do these actions and statements take for granted : considered as same with the above and a scope of codes in hierarchy and friendship had been developed (v) How do structure and context serve to support, maintain, impede or change these actions and statements : considered as same with the above and a scope of codes in hierarchy and friendship had been developed What to be Coded Behaviors to be coded in the research plan generally include the professional service and enduring social activities of nomad professors. Specific acts or events would be a surprisingly enormous amount that can be found in the interview transcriptions, school records and photos with descriptions and thoughts. Activities to be coded may cover the kinds of incident as the administrative staff or head of unit and department, which are of a longer duration and involve other people within a particular setting or strategies. Meanings may be found in the journal writings of researcher and key participants as well as articles or book chapters in PDF format. The state may be coded to disclose the nexus between the NPs and their general conditions to affect the aspect of my qualitative inquiry. Four Elements Themes and topics, ideas and concepts, terms and phrases, and keywords; These four elements can also be seen as hierarchical and play of a coherent understanding of findings. For example, the themes and topics in the research plan would be driven to explore the phenomenology of nomad professors concerned of their identity, professional, social, and personal lives as well as implications of public or campus administration. The ideas and concepts may evolve with the codes, such as competence, leadership, participation, deviant, efficiency, and goals of administration. The terms and phrases will facilitate to link and relate across the data as well that will be drawn from sources. For example, happiness index or job satisfaction or congruence would be used in the business administration that helps to enlighten the theme or stories that the researcher intends to convey. Constant Comparisons Constant comparisons will be alerted on. The significant statements can be drawn from the data and around the contrast in patterns, such as sublime v. vast or common, interested v. disinterested, job satisfaction v. fluid, competent v. stalemate or decline, reward v. fallback and so. A Priori Code v. Grounded Code The idea on the classification of a priori code and grounded code will be applied to create the codes which must be sedulous and attentive over the whole process of coding. For example, efficiency and leadership will fall in the first while travel, sublime, and reward would be the kind of grounded codes based on the data itself. Descriptive and Theoretical Coding The descriptive coding will be conducted with the kinds of code, such as travel, settle, interested or achievement. The analytical or theoretical coding would be based on the kind of codes, such as job satisfaction, professional or professorship, and person or public administration or efficiency. Hierarchical Coding The hierarchical coding is indispensable to progress on or perfect the theme and story. That is my case, of course, that happiness, satisfaction, familial, and support would be friends as a sub-code capped under the parent code of \"personal.\" The efficiency, productivity, recruitment, system inclusion and goals of administration will be submissive to the parent code of \"public administration.\" (c) The Experience and Reflections In using the Nvivo, my experience and apprehension had been fantastic as same with that of SPSS. It is truly with our routine days as impacted by the technology advancement. We just do not say the space explorer for the Mars and outer universe, but can talk about the PC or I-Pod in our close activities. I can present my instant feels and evaluation or criticism as if the kinds of scholar, for example, Guy Sormon, have been on their track as a critique of world civilization. Although the old scholars in this taste may travel and personalize their experience into introduction, comparison, and evaluation, critiquing as well as suggestion, I suppose if the civilization on on-line technology and computer software program now is a greater candidate for their job as a critique of world civilization. As we see, the development of qualitative studies related the computer software programs are not recent, which traces back around 1970's and 1980's. One of most updated form in this public service would be the Nvivo (Kelle, 1995). My initial impression is that it had automated attractively the traditional hand-coding concept and reality, which amazes the researchers with many benefits. One considers otherwise in terms of researcher's amenities and habitual ease with the hand-coding as well as psychic or enjoyment on their work pattern with the paperback version of articles or books. This other view can be imaginary of traditional study at homes of scholars with a shelf of books or classic typewriter. Nevertheless, the Nvivo certainly is a great invention to impact on the arena of qualitative research although it might not be comparable with the translation function of Chrome Google. It provides a formalistic perfection of qualitative data, and creates for the qualitative researchers the unity and convenience as well as utility of facilitating a scientific analysis and satisfaction. As one colleague commented, it is one indispensable friend for the case of qualitative frame of investigation. My appreciation over the experience of using Nvivo also comes together in sensibility of analogy (Wolcott, 1994). One famous cinema director, called Guillermo del Toro Gomez was occasioned in the corner of newspaper with his book titled \"Cabinet of Curiosities; my notebooks, collections and other obsessions. He is a Mexican, and actually is versatile with his career that is notorious not only as a director, but also as screenwriter, producer and novelist. As a director of films, he is said that alternated between the Spanish language dark fantasy, the kind of gothic horror, and mainstream American action movies. He brought reflections with our qualitative method class and use experience of Nvivo. His book title shows the same context of development over the research process of qualitative studies. My notebook certainly is an unmissed attachment with the qualitative researchers in fields and home study for the analytical work. \"Collections\" would be the kind of journal writings and various kinds of data devoted to the project. \"Other obsessions\" might speak for the difficulties and challenges against the successful project and we don't even need to talk about the \"Curiosities\" since it literally says who are researchers (Patton, 2002). One Korean friend once joked who now serves as a rank officer in the government, \"You, professor or researcher, likely comes as a cinema director, and the practitioner, like me, may be an actor?\" One campus news reported that scientists are researching the habitats of native bumblebees.15 Their query is which are to encourage them to forage in fields and thrive in the face of challenge that honeybee population declines have 15 It was from the website of University of Wisconsin-Madison on July, 29, 2015. brought, such as the costs of renting nonnative bees for pollination. Nvivo seems the kind of habitats in which the researchers work to pollinate the outer world or phenomenology that are composed of various sectors and groups, perhaps inactive like the plants in this case. The coding matrices or inter-data analysis in links and various categories and classifications as well as themes or completion into written piece may culminate to perfect the bee work on pollination (Wolcott, 1994). Their work on Nvivo, of course including my case, is likely as if the Viet Minh left cadres in the south as a politico-military substructure within the object of its irredentism. The researcher has to re-track and to reclaim their theme and meaning as a complete written piece as Viet Cong did. They may store data temporal or as hopefully used on a continuum for many projects or research products.16 The kind of guerrilla war and a continuance of regional combat despite the Paris Peace Accord also comes reflexive with the work of qualitative researchers devoted in \"left nothing to be learned\" standard and collection of rich data, as well as the instances of field work along journal writings or constant comparison as an analytical method, as well as recycling of the Nvivo stored data over his career usable for diverse projects. Nvivo certainly works as a convenient and systemic datastored facility beyond the conclusion of Vietnam War. That also is keenly associated with the intrinsic of qualitative studies for diverse possibilities of understanding and lessons (Patton, 2002). For example, the researcher can change a code from the previous research project and may apply a different angle or perspective and frame a theme to suit with his new query. The use of this computer software may also be extended to traditional disciplines, such as law, given that their reference in PDFs or other documents can be coded and analyzed, although they seldom perform a fieldwork to collect the raw data. In using Nvivo, I sensed that the quantitative studies are more popular with the professional article, and the qualitative frame can be more suitable for the dissertation or book forms of report. For me, the kinds of trait had been reaffirmed, and realized with the service of NVivo, so that the qualitative research (i) extends as humanitarian and process-oriented other than liberal or results-oriented (ii) uses a compliant framework rather than the formal measures (iii) is subjective in nature (iv) explore/discover/describe-oriented than hypotheses/fact-checking/ inference-oriented (iv) inductive than deductive (v) phenomenological than logical or positivistic (iv) objectifies the difficulties and challenges of study than relying on the already objectified formula (vi) assumed of dynamics than stable (vii) validity or feasibility with in-depth data output than reliability and so (Wolcott, 1994). Since my major field is referred to as public administration, Nvivo can, in terms of understanding the contemporary human and public organization, be considered a good research base. I suppose that the creation of cognitive strategy map is the kind of edge in the Nvivo, which began with the task of deriving strategic keywords that exist on the thought process of the organization. Within the company, there is a lot of data related to the strategy of the organization within the NVivo among the characteristics or categories of qualitative data (strategies related to various reports, articles and interviews that appeared in the media, CEO messages, interviews and internal members (Kelle, 1995). It is analyzed to derive strategic keywords. Tools coordinate the collections of data for deriving the strategy keyword data by the quantitative analysis, and it is preferred to use the software programs for qualitative analysis. The use of such an application is to be caused by cognitive limitation's historical analysis, and not only could help to overcome the limitations of qualitative analysis, often based on a document (text) in the form of data, but also became possible to process 16 I consider this aspect can be one strength within the qualitative frame of research rather than quantitative studies. This recycling of collected data, documents and various sources of data can be served with the automation of storage, management and analysis function of NVivo. large quantities of data quickly, including data in various formats, such as video and audio files. It turns as a statistical or quantitative proof that produces a great deal of advantages for the result. Typical software used in this kind of study will be the NVivo. As derived from the work, the process starts to clearly set the strategic issues with questions about the first analysis of the strategic keywords through the analysis of qualitative data. Then the variable information associated with the query are present in the collected quality data: the codes to process a job (or node). The completion to transit the collected data to some kind of quantitative understanding, qualitative data by assigning attributes for the clustering of similar meaning or the idea of coded node called grouping. Then the coded data (or nodes) are some of innate attributions performed by NVivo. Quantitative data thus generated is to serve as a useful basis for statistical or quantitative modeling of future quality ever available (Creswell, 2013). Therefore Nvivo can be seen that has the ability to objectify qualitative data in a quantitative or semi-quantitative data. This point can be found through a variety of application functions, for example, plainly with the word frequency function. On the other hand, we can see the NVivo analysis, in a word, as one type of network analysis in terms of its property using a variety of data classifications or categories. With this service, we analyze the qualitative data to create the cognitive strategy map eventually. This advantage can best show the characteristics of NVivo. The attachment below shows several screenshots played within NVivo in the title of my research project \"Nomad Professors: Case studies of One Local University in South Korea.\" The project was exercised as complied with the weekly protocol of NVivo video lessons. Actually I realized that a number of universities provide NVivo tutorial with Y-tubes implying the importance of research method for the graduate students. I began to learn how to get started with NVivo, and successfully created my project. It is the basis to continue on the work of data storage, management and analysis (Wolcott, 1994). Through the progress in lessons, I realized that NVivo allows visualizing qualitative research data and the relationships between them using colors, tree diagrams, and tag clouds. For example, the node created in the name \"education\" was yellow in color that was selected as the program provides. As we see, the data are any more important in the qualitative studies that we have to be skilled to import the data within the project. The data qualified to be stored and managed in the NVivo is diverse in type that the data often available with PCs could be imported. Cliquing \"External\" led to the data stored in the user PC, and can be imported within the label \"Internal.\" The word documents, PDFs, Photo files and video files could be brought into the project. As I became familiar with the software, I could make notes for myself about how the software may help a qualitative researcher organize data, what is considered data in qualitative research, and how the software could be used to support a research study for each of the five approaches. Then I practiced to create a node which can be hierarchical and can respond with the patterns and themes. I chose two parent nodes \"greatness\" and \"education. I also created two sub-codes for each, which are \"sufferance, overcome\" for greatness and \"support, excel\" for the education. The NVivo provides the characteristics of nodes that could network the data in any meaningful structure, themes and patterns or stories. It was excellent that allowed the variety of data to be coded, and the reference could be identified within the program itself. The analyzed result can be exported for the purpose of researcher, e.g. conference or lecture presentation. What is to be coded is the question we explored above, and NVivo allows four types to be automatically processed, say, documents, PDFs, images, and videos. The drag and drop method often is used to link the parcel of data into the node created earlier to contextualize. The videos could be long that the researcher can cut to his pertinent part to drop it within the node. I have imported the photo of empty parking lot, and wild life scenes captured by my camcorder, which addressed my topic of identity of nomad professors. Besides, I already had imported the journal writings, interview transcriptions in MS format, and one article dealing with the spillovers of university-led technology within the locale was imported in PDF. The coding was conducted with the four sub-codes. As I became familiar with the software, I made notes for myself about how to categorize data and visualize the nodes and coding structure. I also learned how to analyze the data on the basis of word frequency and text search. The process was operated with the tab pertinent to the titles, and I could set the queries interesting to investigate. The conditions to search through the data can also be feasible that I can specify a specific data for search or all and any data stored within the program can even be searchable. For example, I typed in 100 words with most frequency to be displayed as maximum. In my case, \"research, university, studies, and professors\" are top four words used most frequently through all the stored documents (10 items) under the title of the project. The result can be analyzed with the retrieved showings, and is seen as absolutely convenient for the purpose of visualization and presentation. The bigger or richcolored words in the word clusters or trees and visualized graphics can relate with the frequency of words. The text search queries differs from those of word frequency that the researcher can type a word to be traced with the data, on the scope of which he put the condition. In my case, I typed in \"support\" and the two interview data respectively yielded 8 words, 2.14 percents in coverage and 23 words with 2.50 percents in coverage. The important condition needed of due attention is that the researcher can manipulate within the spectrum of NVivo, i.e., exact, stemmed words, synonyms, specializations and all. The retrievable words, of course, will increase correspondingly that proper conditions have to be thought of themes, patterns, categories and stories. The learning brings that the researcher can know the benefit of NVivo as to allow sharing findings with stakeholders (Brown, 2015). The lesson on running a coding query and running a matrix coding query shows how the data can be analyzed over the classified nodes and even as linked with the quantitative data already compiled within the project. The process enriched the stories and allowed a cross-data comparisons and analysis, which I consider is the kind of culmination of qualitative data analysis. This stage would be most probable in which the qualitative researchers can be fancied with the kind of Eureka moments. It also shows that the codes and nodes can continually be evolving that the researcher can create new nodes and save the result within the process.

Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. Chapter X Quality, Themes and Write-Up A. Evidence of Quality in the Qualitative Research (a) About the Evaluation of Qualitative Research The sort of qualitative approaches about the quality check also yields a possible set of necessary criteria for evaluation. For example, according to Loh, we can posit that issues of trustworthiness, narrative truth, verisimilitude and utility have to be attended to in order to ensure acceptability and recognition of narrative studies' rigor (2013). Lincoln and Guba suggested four criteria to evaluate the qualitative research in replacement of traditional terms of reliability and validity, which represents the elements of post-positivism and includes the credibility or trustworthiness, transferability, dependability and confirmability. Credibility inquires if the results are believable, and can only be verified by the researchers and participants on their own unlike other criteria (Zamboni, 2015). My work to ensure credibility of my research is to ask for myself whether it tests what it means to test and ask if there are any exterior factors that would cause your data to be inaccurate. Hence, the rigor and \"best possible way\" standard will be minded to evaluate. For instance, prolonged engagement and spending enough time with members of the group would be an effective way to establish rapport and familiarity as well as reduce the possibility of rote answers. By doing so, the account for cultural differences between the nomad and normal professors can be more credible in the responses they receive. We also can learn between the \"richness of data\" and simply \"large amount of data\" to increase the credibility, and the credible research often is characterized with a detailed description of the study environment and conditions readable by the audience. In order to ensure the credibility of the research project, the techniques I can apply to gauge the accuracy of findings will include the data triangulation and through the multiple analysts and member checks. Transferability is defined as the degree to which the data can be applied to contexts other than the context under which the research is performed (Creswell, 2013). In my case, the cases of other local campus or nomad professionals of government can be brought in this capture. The wise researcher to ensure the transferability of his research can center at the kind of mindedness on thick description, possible tradeoffs with the trustworthiness and the intrinsic of transferability with a portion, say, not as fully, that the reader can easily identify. In this process, the reader can note the specific details of nomad professor and situation as well as method involved with the project, and compare to the similar situation they are interested in. Even as researchers collect qualitative data, the dependability is not always guaranteed since the environmental circumstance is constantly changing (Noble & Smith, 2015). For example, the inhumane circumstance of capitalistic exploitation in the age of Marx has generally disappeared as the modern labor law or universal suffrage began to be enforced. Although his theme or lens of analysis may still be relevant even in these times and can be transferable as a part, the dependability is well to be questioned. The dependability requires the same result will be repeated if we apply the results of study. The contextual detail and external audits would be two most powerful techniques to ensure the dependability (Creswell, 2013). The use of external audits is my crucial strategy that I plan to obtain assistance from the outside experts, who review my data and challenge any of the assumptions. In this way, the research findings can be more rigorous to be consistent and replicable, which I believe to be measured by the standard that was conducted, analyzed and presented with the project. The confirmability, termed as objectivity interchangeably, requires that the researcher's biases would not infuse or as minimal as possible and the research findings should be as much as objective in the best possible way of research operation (Zmboni, 2015). An audit can be of great use in this purpose that researchers should create an audit trail with the external auditor. This context had been incorporated within my research plan that several meetings in each stage would be scheduled to ensure the confirmability. NVivo also can be useful that we can yield or refer to the semi-quantitative nature of converted data from those of purely qualitative ones, such as interview transcriptions and PDFs. The remaining question may be if the qualitative researcher ethically is required to keep the data for some period of time to ensure a post-research check of authenticity or to aid the future researchers. NVivo can possibly be useful to facilitate this aspect of responsibility with the provision of storage and management. The reflexive information, such as the background and education of researchers, is one way to increase the confirmability and will provide the reader with a greater understanding of the biases and assumptions that might shape the study's conclusions (Patton, 1999). The importance of confirmability stems from the intrinsic of qualitative studies that allows the research to bring a unique perspective to the studies. (b) Strategies on the Quality, Credibility and Trustworthiness For the quantitative researchers, the statistical methods are powerful indeed to establish validity and reliability of research findings that would lead the researchers into the kind of already marshaled formula. Unlike quantitative researchers, qualitative researchers aim to design and incorporate methodological strategies to ensure the quality, credibility and trustworthiness of the findings (Noble & Smith, 2015). This means that the issues of quality and credibility intersect with audience and intended research purposes, and could vary with philosophical and theoretical orientations. Therefore, the ways of enhancing the quality and credibility of qualitative analysis critically be interwoven with the three distinct concerns (i) rigorous techniques and methods for gathering and analyzing qualitative data, including attention to validity, reliability, and triangulation (ii) the credibility, competence, and perceived trustworthiness of the qualitative researcher (iii) and the philosophical beliefs of evaluation users about such paradigm-based preferences as objectivity versus subjectivity, truth versus perspective, and generalizations versus extrapolations (Patton, 1999). In this context, the rigor is often an important standard to evaluate the quality and credibility or trustworthiness, and the \"best possible way\" standard will be an effective overall yardstick to measure holistically the qualitative research (Campbell & Machado, 2013). Table Challenges and Strategies Challenges Strategies Personal Biases It is a good strategy to share the challenge with the participants and audience. Therefore, it is effective to account for personal biases which may have influenced the findings. For example, the illiteracy of father led to research the narrative studies of the group that can be shared and discussed, in some part, for its influence and moderation so as not to be made fatal of objectivity. I am not only a researcher on the research for the nomad professors, but also would be a participant that discuss implications of my status to influence the research plan Biases of data collection Acknowledging biases in sampling is an important attitude of qualitative researcher. The researcher always has to keep in mind that the qualitative research is dynamic and iterative as well as constantly evolving that the ongoing critical reflection of methods is necessary to ensure sufficient depth and relevance of data collection and analysis. It is very cautioned of getting easy even if he has completed the initial plan of data collection. Strategically, I plan to have a consult and meetings to discuss the ongoing progress of data collection. Possible spoils of data analysis Data analysis is a critical process to construct and complete the theme and stories. Therefore, the researcher has to ensure interpretations of data are consistent and transparent. The guide on the concept map and triangulation of data has to be respected. Meticulous record keeping and demonstrating a clear decision trail increase the power of persuasion and quality or credibility of qualitative research. NVibo is one of great solution in this concern that the researcher is highly recommended to be well skilled of its function and utility. Constant comparison Constant comparison is the way to ensure the quality and credibility of qualitative research. It is part of process to establish his main theme or stories, but also can lead to the alternatives or other context of story with disconfirming evidence and perspectives. This process then eventually perfects the theme and can increase the credibility and trustworthiness of research. In my plan, the nomad and normal professorship is a point of constant comparison, for example. I could establish a comparison case, seek out similarities and differences across accounts to ensure that different perspectives are represented. Challenge of Description The interview may be arranged in Korean language so that the translation is considered yielding the maximum of best effect against the biases and ambiguities. It also is important to include rich and thick verbatim descriptions of participants' accounts to support findings.7The clarity is elementary to increase the quality and credibility of research. It has to be constantly practiced through the research project, for example, journal writings or memos, and descriptions of event and occurrences including the write up stage. The researcher demonstrates clarity in terms of thought processes during data analysis and subsequent interpretations. Challenge of the Monotony The chance of fallacy likely is more probable with solo research. It is no surprise that we can see a number of collaborators as an author of article in the natural science. It comes unconventional in the social science, but is not rare with the co-authorship. One way to increase the quality and credibility of qualitative research is to share and reduce the challenge of the monotony. My strategy is to engage with other researchers to reduce research bias, and obtain the respondent validation. The aspect includes inviting participants to comment on the interview transcript and whether the final themes and concepts created adequately reflect the phenomena being investigated. (c) An Epilogue An anecdote has become an epithet? As Patton ruminated, the qualitative researcher may be someone to be conflagrant with it (2002). It originates from the French word, denoting a secret or private stories in epistemology, that apparently is gotten remote from the science. The terrorist attack of Charlie Hebdo in the early of 2015, reported of the plot of Islam radicals, had reassured the antiterrorist coalition of civilized countries. The caricature of public figures or politicians and the scene of closed courtroom, as we are usual to encounter in the corner of newspapers or magazine, bring a kind of impression that is provocative to query of what is the issue, problem or any solution for the controversy or cases. The curiosity is certainly aroused with the kind of caricatures or public cartoons of said French business. One observer had introduced an important attribute of three ethno-nationals that German would write hundred pages of report, Englishman will have backpack on the shoulder for long journey to experience the camel, and French will inquire of the neighbors and draw a picture when they are asked what the camel is. Although an anecdote itself is never sufficient or merely some kind of socio-political subjects for men, it can be thought relating with the evidence or hypotheses, and must be very consequential to the trained and attuned ear of qualitative researcher. As it is of human, the context is merely an extent of two types of researcher. One may utter the dismissive, \"It's just an anecdote\", but the researchers would differ to practice analyzing anecdotes (2002). In terms of quality, trustworthiness, and credibility, we also need to be discriminative that we play on the anecdote, but are critical of anecdata. It provides the subject matter with an anecdote as Islam thought it to be triggered, while we may falsify or miscarry the project if with the anecdata. The anecdote could be an origin of human sense and awareness, but left with the scientists such long journey of Englishman searching for the empirical data or to write up for the quality research report as if Germans are presupposed. With this, we can consider the perspective of poststructuralists in viewing the criteria for the qualitative research. They turn away from such notions, artificial neutrality to the evolving character of lively social science that has been charted as initiated from the Marxist view. The qualitative researchers, therefore, would be a leader of human orientation as we see in the concern of environmental education. The alternative paradigm or strategic transformation of social science and the visibility of researcher's political and social agenda that had been redolent in this discipline appears to process through the three qualities of nationals that the social scientists are exemplified in every aspect so as to be sparked with the emergent paradigm 's world view as the writer of caricatures and pursued by the means and manner of the study's methodology or design strategy as the data collectors on the camel, and the final product of the inquiry to resonate with the reflexivity, literary worth, transformative and responsive potential, and vicarious experience. The credibility or quality in this sense is not only for the data analysis or collection, but also for its authenticity to be palpable with the contemporaries (Zamboni, 2015). Although I am not a pro-Marxist, his method of social science leads me to revert on his ways of research, which is pounding to generate the circles of progeny thought involved with the environmentalism, feminism, queer theories and economic branches of thought, for example, core-periphery structure of world (Flinders & Mills, 1993). S. H. Kim, one of communism theorist over a period in the Seoul National University, had passed away at the age 74 yesterday with a heart attack in Los Angeles. He studied in London for his graduate degree, and his dissertation, titled \"Theories of economic crises: a critical appraisal of Japanese and European reformulation\" had been the kind of Korean textbook for the communist theories (Kim, 2015). His sudden death brought me to be reflexive over the change of sea impact in terms of paradigm for understanding the society and this qualitative research class as Kuhn and Patton had guided. The Marxist theory is indeed influential and powerful in terms of academic impact that the paradigm of thought is quite ingenious and dialectic over the elements of various sciences. He is, after all, really a sage observer of tumultuous development age of capitalism that we are a student of his attitude (Van Maanen, 1988). Marx was thorough and exhaustive that comes in comport with the \"nothing to be left unlearned\" standard said to be underscored for the qualitative researcher. He is a humanist, economist, historian and political scientist to deal with his subject. The current lesson focused of the interdisciplinary social science studies may be sparked for his way to deal with the issues and controversies. Nevertheless, Marxist theme is of very genius that the \"constant comparison\" can be almost always feasible to be drawn from the capital. He is, however, qualitative to highlight the economic relations, the kind of concept, such as exploitation, which is sensually provocative to merit an attraction. While constant comparison should be important properties for the qualitative researcher, Picketty gave us a discourse of 21th capitals (Noble & Smith, 2015). S.H. Kim also is a same circle of thinkers to awaken the attraction of Korean students that applies the Marxist theory to the European and Japanese reformulation of market economy. Now we also can see how China had been reformulated recently, and days of news headlines for their distinct evolution of stock market. The prophecy was not perfectly hit if Russia and China, other than UK or US, had been colored red in the world map. But that is not a cause to deny his methodologically pioneering insight. In increasing the quality and credibility of qualitative research, it is generally critical touchstone if the qualitative researcher had done the research queries in the best possible way. Marx is astounding that he may be a first person to present the modern form of statistical data to support his thesis. That forefront of method may be comparable with the photos or y-tubes featured in the article or presentation in the new millennium. The rigor and triangulation can well be traced within his method if on the standard of his age, the concept of which now are seen as to evaluate the trustworthiness of qualitative research (Patton, 1999). His theme is foundational to identify the human strands toward the prurient interest of profit yielding and accumulation, but also essentialized on the independent rule of capital to reproduce and expand. This aspect is also corroborating with the thought element of qualitative method that draws upon the humanity and community, but that strives to convey some of independent rules from his studies. Therefore, it can turn to be qualified as a science, and would not matter with specific owners of business or capitalist, but independent to explain the reformulation of Japan and Europe in the age of Professor Kim, and lately that of Chinese market to rank them as world second economy (Kim, 2015). Now Korean public experiences the sad story of succession issue of Lotte, a chaebol now tumultuous among the disputed family members. Corbyn, one of radical leftist leader in Great Britain, is reported as one of most probable candidate for the leadership of labor party. In US, T. Sanders, an American socialist, profiles strongly to appeal for the possible presidency in the next election. That would partly hint on the tending attribute of citizenry, but still is dubious how the independent rule of capital would come demised. Although we critique for his fallacy from aspects, the prophecy of Marx on the history and only resort to communist revolution had been critiqued most acidly or as unethical. That might seem deserving, but his scholarly engagement thrusts to ponder what the quality, credibility, trustworthiness actually mean for the qualitative researcher. That is because, despite the separate views and evaluation of his work, Marx may be most trustworthy for the environmentalists or feminists and many sister circles, at least in their framework of disciplines or perspectives (Campbell & Machado, 2013). We perhaps would be really thrilled at the stage of alienation from the capital and labor that even CEOs or capitalists themselves are enslaved into the independent rule of capital. For example, we may see the suicide of failed CEOs or owners as exemplary that the alienation occurs fatally between him or her and capital. Then they are viewed as laborers, consumers, females, and concerned citizen about air pollution, for example, that turned as a subject of ramified branch of thought over the current scholarly interest (Fox-Keller, 1985). In other words, the tenet and structure of thoughts or dialectics had much influence over the research on the consumerism, female studies, and so on. Except for the political determinism involved with the revolutionary alteration by the labor class, his elaboration had brought the kind of paradigm change from the existing thought. One Korean scholar once discussed the Korean fate in the newspaper article about the national aspiration for the Nobel Prize and reality of only incident, D.J. Kim, who is a recipient of Nobel peace prize. His version is interesting to our class that the scholarly research is of two types, which are not quantitative and qualitative, but the kind of paradigm change quality and normal products. We, Korean scholars, perform well and globally compete with the advanced countries, but their research is vastly normal curtailed of potential to bring a paradigm change. One science writer annually reports if any science researchers of Korean origin fall within the list of possible awardees based on the citation statistics of Thomson Reuter. This context or story may be anecdotal or even some kind of fun that the list is not always successful -precisely speaking often unsuccessful -to forecast the recipient of the year. Nevertheless, we can note that the quality and credibility are not only technical of quantitative nature, but also interrelated with the transferability or dependability as gauged of citations or Nobel prizes. Marxist theory seems notable in this aspect that his theme is highly transferable to the brilliant minds and their dependence is needless of further comment. And the kind of paradigm change research can be bred more probably, in my view, from the qualitative or mixed research than purely quantitative. One reflection is the kind of disparate impression that Marx – not merely Marx of course – created. We often view him as the generator of political fiasco around the cold age, and problematic scholar in the history. I do not say that we have to problematize the issues we are curious about, so as to become a competent qualitative researcher or stress the importance of symbolic interactionism to design our research frame (Creswell, 2013). I like to revisit his greatness in terms of methodology concerning the professionals and researchers that he is thought to survive the angulated age in the vortex of European politics. He was thrust with a vortex of world politics, and I consider he successfully triangulated the contexts or stories into the influential pieces as a comprehensive cornerstone in the social science. As we know, the triangulation is one touchstone that emerges to evaluate and critique the quality, credibility, and trustworthiness. In this viewpoint, I suppose if it is not undue to learn from his lesson and creatively adapt for any new ways of excavation and presentation, at least for the scholarly circle. Somebody may avert his interest from the theme of Marx on various grounds. The communism is eventually destroyed, or simply turns down by saying, \"Look out, obvious with the living quality on materialistic standard between two camps.\" They begin with the concept of economy and materialism, but we can readily draw what the reality is. We see low GDP per capita, for example. The different views may consider if the communists view the international financial system or capitalism as the kind of enemy institution to eventually disappear since they are on humanism in the context of the labor and exploitation (Flinders & Mills, 1993). In these views, the implication is if the real sector economy is any not so bad? Then they would introduce the aged people in a queue in the hope to receive a meal at the distribution outlet. Can it be a scene in the developed countries or South Korea? This kind of interchange has long been conventional across the global states, especially in the kind of states mapped as sensitive from the ideology. The kind of lens is used to foreclose the thought or learning from the communist theory. It is also corroborating that top economics departments of colleges and universities have a scanty of share in the composition of subjects they teach -perhaps small part of labor economics -if not the communist states. Although this implies that Marxist theory is not purely economic, it may be viewed in the reflection as adverted this far. Most importantly, however, I consider them to misread Marx that he actually is the kind of capitalist theorists vastly and in the lived reality of ours. This is the point we can learn of transferability. In terms of transferability, only the portion of research piece is transferable as a matter of definition since the transferee has to play his part for originality and meaningful contribution to the fields of his study (Patton, 2002). Marx eventually altered his rich data and stories of capital for the inevitability and determinism of working class revolution, but his elaboration to reach the conclusion actually has not been obliterated. Somebody may deprave why Marx had been unwise to suggest that alternative changing the stream of political history of world. Let me reserve that part for the next, and the point is the transferability of his work. It is now succeeded to the branch thoughts such as the environmentalism, feminism, and consumerism and on. While the capitalism thrives within the sufferance and challenges, the thoughts may be the kind of \"lived reality\" or \"life experience\", a usual term that we now capture for this class purpose. Then Marx ironically must be the thinker of capitalists other than communist and it is close to us. In this understanding, we see the wake of contemporary influence even if east Europe or Russia may be seen to turn in other way. His lifetime is interesting that he spent many years in London although he was born and raised in Germany (Van Maanen, 1988). In his age, the time was on the kind of Victorian glory with an astounding industrialization and rise of global capitalism. Great Britain at these times was said of world factory as we know. On the while, his home country perhaps had to struggle for integration of Germania and prosperous German imperialism. In the leadership of Bismarck, called the iron and blood prime minister, the European politics turned into tension and conflict. Germany might espionage on the success of Britain and France, and like to learn the capitalism. In the eyes of Marx, the reality might approach as thrilled and inhumane leading to create such complexities within his mindedness and philanthropy. While this context brings me reminiscent of this class on the importance of observation, role of philosophy on the qualitative research, as well as the subjectivity and objectivity discourse, it also trades into the confirmability that we have to ensure of our research plan (Creswell, 2013). We may question if the observation of Marx is accurate with his allegation of 18 hours of boy labor daily in the English factory or he may unduly be subjective to overhaul the imperialistic reality of world politics in the interest of German nation by raising the injustice issue. We also may think of his triangulation of different themes or stories as minimally sensual while harbingering if the humans could be so scientific or complex beings. We may be surprised if we are such a whole to be dissected by Marx? Most importantly, the confirmability arises in the present context of reality if such exploitation would highly be unlikely at the global corner of community (Zamboni, 2015). In any case, Marx is one of greatest qualitative teacher that we can worship despite the criticism, sad political history and later personal career with the real politics. Of course, for the later path of his, a separate view can be if he may be viewed as brave and participatory for international coalition or if he denigrated his academic sanctity for unrealistic ambition. Along the pass away of S.H. Kim and rise of Jeremy Corbyn as tougher labor activist, I may be driven with reflections on pages that apologize for my harangue. I also retrospect between the real politics and qualitative ideas or theme as funny that Koreans once upon a time had a phobia about the word, \"labor.\" However, K.H. Park, Lady President now in power had a plan of focus on the national labor issues in the second term of year. We are glad to see its progress. Even the name of political party must be avoided with the terms, labor, that the labor party in Korea could not survive as a matter of nomenclature. That is because it entangles with the sensibility of communism, which shows how much the qualitative aspect of humans are consequential that we, the student of qualitative method, needs to take an account and be considerate about. B. The Data Analysis and Write-Up (a) A General of Data Analysis It is often challenging for the qualitative researcher that collects the interview data, analyzes it and finally writes up for reporting. In case that the researcher develops the topic of Pennsylvania Amish, Mormon, or Appalachian Woman, she felt that her learning curve would be steepest with the Amish woman and also access to the Amish communities could only be improved after she read several books by scholars (Piercy, 2004). The issue of access may be physical over cases, such as permission and socialization issues, but could be implied of preliminary information and preparation into the subject since the qualitative research stands on the in-depth inquiry of human essence. Although the researcher had some familiarity with Latter-Day Saint, she had to take care with preparation when she turned on the Mormon quilters. The context of this research shows the importance of sensitivity and discreteness of business when we choose the qualitative method. This is despite that her co-investigator had a Mormon faith and quilted in her spare time. The Piercy's case has implications that the themes, stories and analysis of interview data through the write-up for reporting are the kind of conglomerate as requires the qualitative mindedness and orientation. For example, she had to read the transcription over and over again, and needed to keep memoing while constant comparison was exercised within the assumptions or theories from the literature review and interview data. Hence, through the analysis of field data and write-up for presentation, it would be a founding thought that the loophole of qualitative researchers lies how to make the process, eventually his theme or research findings. \"qualitative\" indeed. In the grand picture of process, the researchers are asked to interpret findings, determine substantive significance, and elucidate phenomenological essences as finally destined for cases to hermeneutic interpretation. A thick description from the collected data often enables to create the bedrock for the preparation of write-up, which can turn on or develop as the thick interpretation for a complete phase of research project (Creswell, 2013). Two steering guides could instill for the prepared minds over the work of analysis and writing a quality report that the purpose of researcher actually often is crucial to orient the writing and reporting. It is encouraged in the qualitative research since the subjectivity on the lens of analysis or perspectives are vital to make the research qualitative. I may illustrate that it can be compared with the combined form of public exam, say, multiple choice questions and essay questions, which could pertain to the mixed method in our case. The essay portion would be seen as qualitative that it tests the humans as a whole who write the question on purposes and themes. It is in contrast with making a simple choice on the already formatted style, which may be more akin to the quantitative studies. Causal explanation occurs frequently through the qualitative analysis that elevates the events, statements, occurrences, activities, the kinds of data to be coded, into a scientific algorism and for the purpose of generating a meaning, story and contexts (2013). Along the guides, the researcher will be best of practice that directs his progress on analysis of data and quality writing so as to be staffed with reflexivity and voice. Balancing the description and interpretation also is one aspect of consideration. Good work on this aspect could enhance the quality of writing as to be finely tuned for the themes or stories as well as propositions intended by the researcher. Communication with metaphors and analogies is related with the scholarly dimension that increases the quality of writing with a due sophistication, power of persuasion, repercussion and so (van Manen, 2006). It rests with a distinct trait of qualitative research. The reporter of research findings finally seriously considers if he or she creates or interprets visuals since the visual presentation has dual consequences with the strengths and weaknesses. In the analysis of interview data, McCracken proposed the five step analysis in which each step represents a higher level of generality (1988). Therefore, the proposition needs to be detailed to suit the specific context of qualitative research. The first step for the analyzer of interview data in any qualitative research is to read the transcripts carefully. Of course, making a notation in the margins would be highly practical and effective. The five steps were briefed in the table below, and provide the ground for this assignment. Other example used for the module of Bilingual Education Teacher Interview provides a great insight in conducting the similar context of research, which also pertains to the research on the nomad professors (Qualitative Data Analysis, 2015). The first step is to transcribe the interview, which is followed by the preliminary exploratory analysis. The next work is to make connections to the research questions. In this step, the researcher creates a coding scheme and conducts to code the data. As we practice in the Mini Project, the inter-rater reliability comes to enhance the confirmability and trustworthiness of research. Finally, the researcher interprets his research findings and write up for reporting. The guide is simplistic, but has a potential of plenary application commonly across the specifics of many research projects. Table 1 Five Steps of Qualitative Data Analysis  As we see, the themes are crucial to key on the research that has to be defined properly. According to Ely and associates, a theme is a statement of meaning that runs through all or most of the pertinent data or one in the minority that carries heavy emotional or factual impact. (b) The Research Plan and Data Analysis In the Mini-project, three interview data were generated, and assigned for each pseudonym, i.e., Abraham, Isabel, and Penguin that I initially intended to research the nomad professors in the X University. I have read carefully twice to conduct the analysis of the transcriptions and final write up. Through the reading, I made notations in the margins, which may be more systemically available with the MS tabs. Since the job was not extensive, I handled marking the notations on the paperback transcription. The result of NVivo performance also was utilized, however, that was connected with my further work on this assignment. The interviews were planned to draw the themes for my research questions, to say, the identity of NPs, as well as personal, social and professional aspect of their lives in the X University. The interviews were anticipated to provide the notion and mindset of stakeholders about their admiration and wishes, the kind of role model in considering their life value and moral or ethical touchstones. The literature review was conducted that there were sources of literature to deal with the social identity and lives of minority group within the community (Phenice, Griffore, 2000). For example, Van Dijk focused on discourse analysis and understanding ethnic and racial inequality in society. Kingsbury and Scanzoni describes that much of our knowledge for minority group – as focused on the ethnic minority families – is grounded in theories of structure and function. Raigin and Hein questioned that the studies in this sort is quick to investigate and make an adaptation with the prevalent cultural stereotypes, which is received as a point of consideration for the quality and credibility of my research. It required that the data collected from the nomad professors, deans of department and housewives or other stakeholders should not be truncated or biased with only little methodological substance. Marger also delineated the flaws of using a comparative or cross-societal framework of ethnic minority families, and Billingsley criticized the mainstream of narratives that the poor and powerless were often compared with others more fortunate (2000). In pursuit of research theme on nomad professors, the ecological approach is considered as most useful and effective tools to describe and interpret our theme. It is based on the concept of familial relationship to analyze the social phenomenon and with the skepticism or distrust of traditional social identity theory. The rationale for my choice is quite obvious in terms of aspects and intrinsic. First, the colleges and universities traditionally had been viewed as quasi-family nature of community in which they share and exchange with the compassion and common purpose or direction as well as for the socialization and happiness. Second, the teaching and research are presumed as if the parental and brotherly relationships essentialize on their performance. They collaborate for more competitive research and they indoctrinate their disciples with love and affection. Third, they generally are not dominated by the pecuniary interest unlike the context of secular world, but the giving or charity as well as school psychic of gratuity and generosity would be more powerful or practiced. The essentials of this system underlies (i) the relationships between family members, (ii) patterns of reciprocal influences embedded in networks of environments (iii) family behavior in terms of resources and energy exchanges17 (iv) decisions of the family and process of transforming, utilizing, and managing these resources (v) adaptation activities to reach certain outcomes, such as to improve their quality of life (2000). This approach, therefore, underscores a focus on the dynamics of process relationships than risks or assets. The three key elements on this framework are composed of inputs, throughputs and outputs. For example, throughput refers to behaviors, techniques, strategies, or, more generally, approaches used to transform or utilize the resources that flow through the family, which requires more careful definition and considerable elaboration than other two. It is 17 The cycle turns beginning with take-in of resources through the production of human energy, outputs in this frame. Inputs flow from the resources, say, energy and information. especially relevant with the research of nomad professors, meriting a critical attention that Inputs, throughput, outputs, and structures are defined within environments. Where the environments in this context include three dimensions, i.e., the human-built environment, the social-cultural environment, and the natural-physical environment, I may apply this frame to the research plan (Wallace, 1970). The families in my case simply are the stakeholders and subjects of research, which include the nomad professors, other professors, campus administrators, families of NPs, students, and local people among others. That would be delivered in the next turn, and I have prepared the brief of interview analysis according to the five steps and within the box form. Table 2 Research Plan and Interview Data Themes Categories Codes  Leadership  Participation  Difference  Input/Throughput/ Output  Professional/Social/Personal  Greatness  Sufferance  Education  Support  Success  Overcome  Excel  Teacher The interview transcriptions at total ranged around six pages long, in which one respondent seems to return a rote answer with few elaborations for the specifics. In others, some replies contain long soliloquies with phrases and descriptions. It plainly has wide margins for my marking of notation. Since individual paragraphs and reflection of ideas in connection are one vantage point to analyze and write up, and I frequently break into long answers and bracketing occurred with the notion and expectations created from the literature review and examination of research questions. As said, the stage of data analysis is not a work of deadlock process only relying on the collected data, but should be a process to be iterative, productive, and emerging as affected by the previous work and as changed from the initial plan toward the evolutionary dynamism. Therefore, utterances had been useful to connect ideas and transform the coding analysis into the categories and themes (Patton, 2002). I practiced memoing during the analytical work. For example, to mark on the code of \"greatness,\" later connected with the theme of \"difference,\" I bracketed as a memo, \"she is truly humanitarian and philanthropist as well as inspirational speaker with love and affection... she is open-minded to recognize others for their accomplishments.\" The practice of memoing positively effects on the human quality, which sets off read materials by himself. That is because the read materials tend to disappear from the registry within the inner mind of researchers when understanding occurs. That is problematic to mainly pass off the phrases and sentences of data. The researchers are, of course, more prone to fail of this aspect of problem than the examinees. They generally experience handling a mass of data unlike the examinees, so that they prefer to seek or refer than memorize. They would be easy since the data are readily referable once saved in the Nvivo or his PC. This tendency even had been scientifically explored with the lay persons other than researcher if the information comes very intimate with the technology advancement. Often the contemporary persons do not memorize, but surf onto the internet every time when they are needed of information. The theory of family ecological system advised me to trace the input, throughput and output over the codes I have developed in eight words. The research questions also were aligned relating to formulate the categories to bridge the codes into themes. A complicated nature of matrix was developed to produce the three themes in my case, which are leadership, participation and difference. That was never an easy process, but the observations made of the whole of data analysis, such as memoing, journal writing, coded results, gradually could develop into preliminary descriptive and interpretive categories (Wolcott, 1990b). The work on the analysis of interview had culminated that identified connections and develop the pattern codes, determined the basic themes by examining clusters of comments (from respondents) and memos (from the researchers), and finally delineated predominant themes. Across the amount of data and classification in the NVivo, the themes must have been productive to encompass a scope of meanings or stories, for example, competence, professorship, satisfaction and system inclusion among others (Creswell, 2013). It had been finally filtered out as three themes upon the completion of examination of themes from all interviewees. Please bear in mind that it had been an iterative process that deleted coded passages and added overlooked passages. For example, I overlooked the response at first reading, \"Her father, who her mother claims was a one-night stand, was in and out of her life.\" The kind of familial situation, however, actually means a great deal of importance in shaping the personality and character. It is also noteworthy that the work bears on the creativity of researcher to look for connections among the codes and link them to a theme. The use of NVivo facilitated this process. For example, the \"support\" and \"education\" had showed a significant connection among the codes, and the analytical elaboration finally produced the \"difference\" as a theme. The pertinent part of this code may be illustrated, \"Her grandmother taught her how to read by the age of 3, which is remarkable. I learned to read by the age of 4, so I have always been inspired by that in Oprah. Her grandmother also raised her in the church (education)...... It is because of these characteristics instilled in Oprah by her grandmother and father that she has risen to the level of success that she has today and influenced so many others in life positively (support).\" These predominant themes would be a basis for writing up the data, and discuss the general properties of thought and action in the group (van Manen, 2006). (c) A Write-Up of the Interview Data Abraham, Isabel, and Penguin, three interviewees, were asked to describe someone that they admire, and to present reasons why they select the admired. The purpose of interview is to open up and share information on the views or concept of admiration and obtain a clear understanding of what they aspire as great professionals or lives, the kind of personal measure on the greatness, based on which we deal with our topic of the nomad professors. They all gladly agreed to participate and the interview was conducted thirty minutes for each respondent, and the informed consent was obtained. The due context of interview protocol was observed, for example, a concession on the use of audiotape during the interview and explanation of study purpose. Abraham selected Oprah as his most admired public figure, and Isabel did Anne Frank. They relatively provided details of information about the awareness and sensibility. Penguin selected her deceased mother, but the information is far shorter and limited. The research findings inferred empirically from three sources of data show that the admired persons are distinct from three important attributes, what are the leadership, participation and difference. These qualities evidenced that the social prominence and active attitude are generally common within the socially successful and admired person. Other attribute is also consequential that they differ in terms of input, output and throughput. The response from the interviewees is partial and complementary, which, however, can tell what elements the stakeholders consider as most important for the success of nomad professors. The three interviewees had a general understanding of admiration. Penguin perceived it as simple, and took as the kind of standard or example of how he would like to live my life or conduct myself so that others might see in me and then choose to operate in the same manner. His definition fairly was interactive that the emphasis was put on the modality of personal living style. Abraham offered a little sophisticated definition, \"The admiration is something that occurs in our mentality about the person, and the kind of awareness and sensibility created from the experience, such as daily experience or some of intellectual experience.\" Over all three sources, we can affirm that the admiration stems in a distinct cycle thorough the sufferance, education and talent as well as excelling or overcoming his or her deprived situation. For example, Abraham told, \"Anne Frank is just 13 years old when her homeland, Netherlands was devastated with the invasion of German army. She hid two years with her family during the Nazi occupation....her composure and management in the constant fear of death is really admirable.\" Isabel described the tumultuous youth age of Oprah, and hardship to overcome with the education and support. Her statement is typical of the cycle that (i) she had poor life stories at her earlier age, born to a teenage and raised with father and grandmother (ii) her grandmother was affectionate and concerned of her, who encouraged and supported her growth with education and support (iii) she was determined to excel her black neighbors, who often are frustrated with such challenges of her sort. Penguin also stated this kind of stories, \"When food was limited, she did not eat but fed us instead...she was our cheerleader...no matter what we wanted to try...being the kind of person she was took me by the hand and looked me in the eyes...\" Through these kinds of input and throughput, the output turns to his greatness with achievements and success. Abraham told, \"She is a humanitarian and I truly believe that you can no greater than that...Characteristics and qualities that describe Oprah are love, trustworthiness, honesty, giving, caring, sharing, communication skills, ability to delegate, ability to listen, sense of humor...Oprah has given many some of greatest advice on living a positive and happy life based on her life experiences both good and bad.\" The success, however, remains volatile given a holistic evaluation of professional, social and personal lives. Often they are brilliant with the three dimensions. However, it is not necessarily the case always true with most of great figures. They may be socially viewed as a negative personality sometimes. In a considerable number of cases, the personal and family lives were distorted and aggrieved. For example, Isabel perceived, \"The diary was retrieved by her father, and published in more than 60 different languages since it was first published under the title...its publicity has been worldwide through movie films, which accustomed the public to share and become aware of her spirit and courage...Anne look like Jesus nailed in the Cross in terms of symbolic impression about her...she will be painted in reality that be shown to look like the girl of her age, but perhaps extremely altered or captivated with the panic.\" In this context, the \"difference\" of admired person from common neighbors has two aspects of implication that they are raised and perform differently in pattern. Other aspect is that they could be viewed with a different yardstick in terms of three dimensions with a concern of nomad professors. Based on the empirical data of three interviewees, the admiration or person to be admired underlies three distinct attributes that they are a leader, active participant and someone who can well come as different from other livelihoods. Anne would be a true leader although she has to hide herself two years. Her spirit and performance were same with the war reporters of adult age that came at forefront of war field and heralded the war stories and tragedies. Anne's mentality remains within the kind of dimension that the quality of leadership operates. It is needless to advert that she was participatory to relate with civilian peace cause. The case of Oprah also comes as same with Anne that she was a true leader to teach and inspires the American public. She now is considered as one of most influential opinion leader in the US and world. Reference Campbell, D.F. & Machado, A.A. (2013).

Reflection on the Progress One study pointed out that with the rise in virtual work teams, flexible work arrangements, and personal electronic devices in the workplace, the opportunities for cyberloafing - using the Internet for non-work activities - are plentiful and creating serious problems for many businesses. Before I had this class, I must certainly have been the kind of person that deviated from the research theme, contexts, and stories. I might be a trouble maker for the supervisors or anemone as passive in the sea of data that could not adequately handle on the qualitative research project. I realized that the stage of qualitative inquiries is a tightened work frame from the data collection, analysis, write up and the interview protocols or coding process as well as write up plan should never be the kind of idle time on the internet as cyberloafing (Cherryholmes, 1992). The qualitative method has a strand that bought the flexibility, subjectivity, and diversity as demonstrated with the underlying assumption of the open-ended questions or semi-structured interviews. We often dose an exam to test the preparation and learning of students, in which the teacher or professor uses two forms of question, i.e., multiple choice or objective questions and essay questions. This is to test if they are prepared for their job responsibility after the schooling or apply their learning to their private or public lives for more decent living. That would be an important mission of college or professional schools. A considerable number of researchers would stay easy on this extent of progress just because they already are well trained with massive classes of learning in the college days. Although the US and other advanced curriculum for the junior researcher or continuing training program offers the research method class, I am not sure if that would be the case for the Asian or other countries. As the exam is essential for the scope of students or learners, I believe that the knowledge of research method is something like the general genre of disciplines, such as the introduction to sociology, economics or politics, American legal system and so. Although we stress the importance of explorative mind for the children or high school and college students, the professional researcher often is bred in the graduate programs. Therefore, the mode of interaction a little differs that the seminar type is prevalent for instruction or exchange of ideas and opinions, for example. The term paper is more preferred than dosing a test for the graduate students. This aspect is essentially related with the creativity and originality of research expected of them in their career progress ahead. In this context, the classes on the research method are capturing the audience of various disciplines commonly as if the introduction of economics were to be for the students of the department (Crotty, 1998). We stress in greater emphasis and on practical consequence that the researchers of social science are interdisciplinary, and we also compare their reality as if the sailors on the sea, the kind of symbolic impression to emanate the feel of research community and academia. On this sense, the researchers may like the Bada, meaning sea in Korean and name of female vocals, and make a time to enjoy the trumpet, Le concerto de la mer, played by Jean-Claude Borelly. On this vast horizon and diversity, the research methods are thought any unique common resort for the social scientists of different disciplines as if the superannuated scholars trace the introduction of economics in reminiscence. This feel of sharing must come first to improve my perception and adaptation. The second, perhaps most important progress, is that I realized the skills and knowledge of methodology should be consequential as if we must know the liberty virtue as inculcated in the college days. The knowledge of methodology was structured and disseminated in concrete forms as if we experienced the general content subjects in the respective discipline (1998). This uniformity of understanding and built-in system of methodology discourse for the trainees apparently bring as indispensable and must-done. This aspect comes especially impressive for my case. That is because I initially considered this class might pass as smattering while I was awed of the quantitative class last year for reasons. Such gut gradually turned false that I was excited to be illuminated into the lessons and tips of research over the progress. Most of all, I had long been queried how brilliantly the Korean or Asian social scientists and authors perform. It remains a kind of mystery without a formal learning of NVivo or methodology class since they are generally qualitative adherents on their research (Mauss, 2010). The sequence of instructions likely resolved the long time \"hang around\" about them. I have realized the gradual emergence of themes or into stories from the data collection and analysis. Although they may not receive the instruction of qualitative method, the sequence, I suppose, certainly reflects on the scholarly process for meditation, articulation and into the final write-up. The weekly lessons simply dissect the streams of human mind devoted to the research and written articulation. In sum, the qualitative method is more likely universal over two planes of intelligence, to see, the west and orient, rather than quantitative one (2010). This context also comes with the medical intelligence of both pans that the anatomy should be basic and the starting point for the modern medical science, which had not been the case – at least later -in the oriental practice of medicine. On this sense, I could become readier and more positive through the learning points of weekly class, and proud of much progress as presented in the table below. Along the class, I also was affected how the westerners like to describe and keep recording or journaling. I wonder if this attitude would bring the current prosperity of methodology discourse although the innermost of trait between two planes of scholars eventually converge. This seems the point of lesson for the oriental peers, who could convert himself to be explorative and prefer to be empirical as written. The passivity of them in this sense may be reconsidered. It is good at lesson to practice a diary or make himself accustomed to journaling. A Brief Progress Report A Progress Check-up on the Qualitative Reasoning and Analysis Can the learners clearly distinguish between the quantitative and qualitative methods? As we note in the first tip of advice from NVivo officials, most regrettable is that the researchers had no definite ideas or clear grip of distinction between the quantitative and qualitative methods. This point of learning provides the researchers with the adequate knowledge and exposure about what method is more suitable to his research problems and research design. Over the discussion with peers and feedback, I can compare qualitative and quantitative approaches, and analyze a qualitative research article, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of both methods. I also can consider the benefit of mixed approach into my research plan. Can the learners develop properly the research problem, purpose and questions? Since the researchers are working on the kind of steps through the research problem, purpose and questions, it is required that the learners have a good awareness and skillful developers of holistic picture of research, what we often call a research design. Although the initial plan can be revised oftentimes – especially not infrequent in the qualitative studies, this kind of framework has a deep implications of orientation of research. The ideas may stem from the ethnic or social status of researchers as a minority or personal experience as well as the needs of workplace, which often are qualitative in nature. For example, the advocacy and voice for the minority or phenomenology for the cultural groups are any popular context that the qualitative research problem arises. In considerations, the work on this early stage of research is more significant within the qualitative studies than quantitative ones. Over the course, I became able to formulate the research problem, purpose, and questions for a qualitative research plan, defend and critique the research problem, purpose, and questions for a qualitative research plan, and analyze a reflective journal writing experience. Can the learners state the intrinsic and types of qualitative approaches? There are disagreements how we sort out the qualitative approaches. However, the general view acknowledges five types of qualitative approach. They are narrative inquires, phenomenological investigation, grounded theory method, ethnography and case studies. The methods are qualitative in basics, but can differ in terms of data types collected, analysis technique, suitability to specific context of research, ways of presentation and write-up, and so on. Therefore, the basic exposure to five major qualitative approaches is very important through the chapters of qualitative learning. Over the class interaction, I became able to analyze qualitative approaches to research, select a qualitative approach that best fits a research problem, purpose, and questions, and defend the selection. My research topic is concerned of nomad professors in the X university that turned out as proper to deal with the case approaches. With a further reading of case studies, I have made myself well equipped with the traits, such as multiple site case studies and single site ones. Do the learners know the role of theory? The role of theory is crucial to conduct the qualitative research. It often employs an inductive reasoning that the researcher has a focus on the field data and churns to draw meanings or stories, and themes. It is comparative with the deductive approach of quantitative studies beginning with the literature review as foremost and infers the hypotheses, which eventually will be tested with the empirical data. The role of theory in the qualitative research is distinct among the five approaches. Most notably, the grounded theory method starts without the theory and the ultimate purpose is to develop the research findings into his own theory. Hence the extensive use of concept map and collection of large amount of data are duly expected in this approach. The theory or philosophy may be inspirational as the poststructuralism and post-constructivism had inculcated. Husseri, Faucalt and many enlightening thinkers on humanity and social science provides the lens of analysis and perspectives that the qualitative researchers usefully draw upon. Corbin & Strauss, Creswell, Patton, Yin and Madison also contributed to enrich the methodological frames as a theorist. The feminism, queer theory, action research and post-modernism also provides the framework and tools to develop the qualitative themes. The theory of specific discipline can also provide the basis of research framework and factors to shape the research design concerned of logic, metaphor, data collection, and analysis. Over the course, I was able to analyze the conceptual or theoretical framework in a qualitative study, and compare the role of theory in five qualitative approaches. Are the learners aware of the role of context, bias and researcher in observation? Observation is a primate method of data collection in the qualitative research. It has strengths, for example, that is direct, immediate, and power of reinforcement for the propositions or criticisms. The weaknesses are identified that it eventually has to turn as written description or interpretation. In other words, observation itself could not qualify for the data, and it could occur with the photo or video data. NVivo provides a useful ambit to store and manage these various kinds of data. Most of all, observation has to be considered in terms of context, bias, and person of researcher. Observation of the same objects does not necessarily result in same descriptions, but varies depending on the context, bias, and person of observer. Over the course, I was able to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of observation as a data collection method, and correlate results of an observation to the roles of bias, context, and the researcher in qualitative research. Do the learners understand the observation and sampling? Through two occasions of picture and video observations, I had experienced diverse possibilities of observation result for respective observer. This provides a lesson for best practice of observing and importance of observation through the quality and credibility of research. The data collection is orthodox that the purposeful sampling often is conducted to sharpen the quality of data. It evinces that the qualitative research is thematic, contextual, story and narrativebased, which makes a whole of humanity and community, but in subjectivity for intact cultural group, for example. It comes in contrast with the quantitative studies which describes the properties for the general population. The sampling size varies with the five types of qualitative approach, but is not large usually, for example, 5-10 participants and 20-30 at grand scale of research. Over the coursework, I was able to compare observation experiences and techniques, recommend and justify a sample size for a qualitative research plan. How much are the learners skilled with the interviewing? In-depth interview is most popular and powerful method of data collection in the qualitative research. It is framed with openended questions and semi-structured form. The interview protocol was developed with the exercise of Mini-Project, and interviews were conducted with the lesson of two set of models available in this class. The advice and tips of care in conducting the interviews were duly instructed with the practice. For example, the explanation of study purpose must clearly be communicated to the interviewees at the beginning of interview. The consent form had to be obtained to make sure that the interviewee is voluntary. The probing questions had to be preferred that should be tactical to draw as much as information possible. A double-check of interview data with the participants after the interview is highly advisable for the authenticity of data and effective analysis. Over the coursework, I was able to evaluate interviews for best practice in the interviewing techniques, develop interview questions and an interview protocol. How much are the learners skilled with the coding analysis? The coding is a scientific way to analyze the data collected in the fieldwork. It creates the basis to delineate the contexts, stories, and themes that are brought together into the write up of data. The coding principles were well knowledgeable, for example, descriptive and analytical coding,\"nothing to be left unlearned\" standard, or constant comparison among others. The hand-coding exercise helped to understand how the coding is conducted and what the coding provides for the analytical work. It is an evolutionary process and perspectives of researcher orient the analysis that surely is a center stage for the qualitative method. Over the coursework, I was able to apply principles of coding to hand-coding data, compare coding structures and strategies, and recommend data collection and data management techniques appropriate for qualitative research. Are the learners competent to use computer software program of qualitative data analysis? Generally, the computer assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) is used in a wide purpose and convenience. It provides automation for the transcription analysis, coding, text interpretation, recursive abstraction, content analysis, discourse analysis, and grounded theory methodology, and so on. NVivo is a qualitative data analysis computer software program produced by QSR international, and was exciting to store and analyze the collected data. Over the weekly tutorials, I have acquired a basic knowledge and kills how to use it, for example, creating the project of qualitative research, incorporating the data into the program files, and deal with the magic of nodes to analyze the field data, such as interview results, photos, internet files, and so on. Over this progress, I was able to recommend data analysis techniques appropriate for a qualitative research plan, apply principles of coding to using software to code data, and analyze advantages and disadvantages of using software to code data for qualitative research. Are the learners duly exposed to the writeup of analysis and evidence of quality? Unlike quantitative researchers, qualitative researchers aim to design and incorporate methodological strategies to ensure the quality, credibility and trustworthiness of the findings. This means that the issues of quality and credibility intersect with audience and intended research purposes, and could vary with the philosophical and theoretical orientations. The analysis of data for themes and write-up is a critical part of qualitative research that the five steps were proposed as paradigmatic by McCracken. Over the learning, I was able to evaluate data analysis for evidence of quality, and analyze data for themes. B. Blending or Adapting and Qualitative Approaches As we learn through the course progress, it seems to me that the challenges and subtleties arise from two properties of qualitative studies. That is, the qualitative researcher has to play as an unobtrusive observer in the data collection stage, and should be a good surveyor who competently and persuasively triangulates the findings. The issue of triangulation occurs in dimensions and relating with the enhancement of credibility as we are aware. In other words, it may be exercised involved with the stages of qualitative research, i.e., among the data collection, analysis and write-up as well as different methods, such between quantitative and qualitative methods. To say, the qualitative findings can improve the trustworthiness and credibility by triangulating their findings with the empirical evidence gained from the quantitative studies. Triangulation is the kind of properties intrinsic with the humans and universe provided if they are evolutionary or fluid on one hand and stagnant on the other.18 Hence, we can be assumed to have a better understanding by blending or adapting the stories generated from both sources. Patton guides four kinds of analytical triangulation which covers triangulation of qualitative sources, mixed qualitative-quantitative methods triangulation, analyst triangulation and theory/perspectives triangulation (2002). Creswell also depicts a simple, but capturing three elements in the diagram showing three elements are intersected to produce the qualitative knowledge (2013). In this showing, the world views, assumptions, theories are one sector while the qualitative researchers also are responsible for the other two, say, research design and approaches to inquiry. All the elements would be evolutionary or fluid and stagnated commonly, but varying with the 18 This kind of strand may be ideated, for example, the most recent NRC studies on the assessment of doctoral programs that the frame was developed within two dimensions, regression quality and survey quality. different degree. For example, the assumptions, research design and approaches to inquiry would be more evolutionary or fluid than others seen more stagnated. The blending or adaptation is the kind of art in which the qualitative researchers are to be measured and creativity or value competes for the quality piece of articles or books. Given the researcher himself would be a learner through his project, it might be one of zone of proximal development (ZPD) as if one junior researcher defined, \"the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under ..... guidance or in collaboration with more (Heinze, 2008, p.3).\" Along the journey of qualitative method, it likely would be felt to us that we experience many blind alleys, dead ends and treacherous terrains (Gay, 2000). The blending and adaptation would incur on these challenges and possible incongruity so as to be destined within the treacherous terrains. We have seen the importance of heuristic process within learning and research, and the blending or adaptation would be some kind of culminating stage that turns the story into conclusion. While the blending or adaptation is presumed of empirical data collected, this never denies the importance of qualitative strands. As we learn, purpose guides the analysis of data, and well prepared mind is necessary to orient and define the quality and more refined dealings of qualitative research. The focus and lens of analysis within the subjective minds would not be an evil, and the action research or voice for the minority group to increases the awareness of audience are popular in this method. As Pascal preached, the zeal and knowledge would be the quality with which the archaic of new knowledge emerges and the blending or adapting is practiced by the researcher (Patton, 2002).19 In consideration of blending or adaptation as the kind of creative final touch for the work, the qualitative studies, as we are inculcated, has a distinct aura or trait that had been argued over hundreds of pages in the textbook. It is truly discriminative to make the studies qualitative indeed. As we see the post-modern reality of contemporaries, whether marginalized or super-marked, it turns to be both qualitative (Holmes, 1962). The exchange of public discourse now transcends the general and often overwhelming proposition based on the quantified data, but the contexts, stories or themes can express more in-depth and be suited with the reality. For instance, the Smith College recognized that the faculty takes on new teaching challenges and viewed that they learn best from one another. With the difficulties of physical gathering of faculty and challenge of limited resources, they developed online series of case study modules with the participation of \"blended faculty.\"20 This corroborates with the suggestion of triangulation of \"multiple analysts\" by Patton, and 19 Pascal, in the Pensees, illustrated four kinds of persons in the universe, who would have zeal without knowledge, knowledge without zeal, neither knowledge nor zeal, both zeal and knowledge. 20 This might be seen superficial or just on the reality of ours without the quantitative verification. I consider if the qualitative research has a strength of depth or rich data from the field, I consider, on the other side, it may have the kind of superficiality, say, less on the description of general populace, but on the ethnos, cultural groups or minorities, which, however, would be realistic and cultural. The context likely revives the embedded dichotomy from the age of Platonic discourse, what social psychologists call \"the principle of superficiality versus depth.\" For example, Lyotard challenged the Platonic view of a true meaning hidden behind surface. He instead insisted that sense manifestations had their own reality which necessarily impacted upon the general world view. I feel that his attribution to a \"theatrical world view\" and the \"purely verbal order of intelligibility\" can be seen the quality of knowledge generated from the quantitative studies. In other words, it would be hyped to rule and be ordained with some textual order of verbs, and he sends the message that the post-modernist may work on the apparent reality or distinct cultural group. The blending or qualitative adaptation may be qualitative or even purposive in some aspect that, nevertheless, would be zone of art and skills, values and valorization of critical thought on the part of researchers. This view can also be shared with the deconstructionists, who have increasingly sought to undo the depth/surface hierarchy, proposing in ironic style that superficiality is as deep as depth. shows the contentious process to the collective intelligence which might be dialectic or teleological (2002). As we note, the collective intelligence is shared or group intelligence is formed that emerges from the collaboration, collective efforts, and competition of many individuals and appears in consensus decision making. Creswell discussed the concluding stage of qualitative research, and illustrated the importance of blending or adaptation between the contents and methodology (2013). Therefore, it often occurs in two contexts in which the research can be more credible or confirmable with analytical triangulation and where the concluding stage led to conclusion requires for the sublimation from the contents and methods. My research was viewed as the case studies that I may take a moment to qualify the blended whole to be processed in that approach as seen in the figure below. Figure Blending in the Qualitative Methods Adapted from Creswell Recently, the physicists have unveiled a raft of new findings about neutrinos bombarding the earth from above, below and within. The qualitative researchers in the final stage or write up may be situated in this kind of attack that they are laden with a tack of virtual information to be developed completely through blending or adaption. Then we may Blending and Adaptation Format Blended : (i) Ex plication of the proble m, (ii) Thorough descri ption of the context or setting and the process es observed, (iii) Discu ssion of important the mes, (iv) Finally, \"lesso ns to be learned\" Research Questions Blended or Adapted from the Research Problem and Theorectical Constructs through the Author's Own Constructs Validation Adpated : (i) Using multiple data sourc es for the themes (ii) Che cking the final account wi th select participants, or member checking. Diverse Themes Emerged and Blended or Adpated into the Overarching Themes finally be content with the piece, as if we yell \"Bearly there\" at the donation of a 12-foot-tall stuffed polar bear being prepared for display atop the foyer entrance of Doctoral museum's permanent collection. Bear may linguistically is nuanced of the kind of tolerance and symbol of endurance, and the orientals also share this sense that we traditionally worship this animal as voluminous and enduring. Through the blending and adaptation, the data as well as their analysis and interpretation stored and managed in the NVivo would turn transcendental into some piece of publishable product, the kind of stuffed bear to wait for sharing. C. An Epilogue I have read one interesting article reported by the Association Press and JoongAng, in which major cities of Korea were disputed and on the vogue to wait for the official determination (Choi,2015). As I have been much interested in the city politics, I like to make a time to review. Especially, the citizens of both cities are alleged to be alert of further development of lobbying, and the policy impact from the turbulence of citizenry would be concerned with the officers of central government that the feasible public programs are currently researched or evaluated to reduce a negative impact. Incheon Metropolitan City is pushing a plan to modify the written order as one of the \"search for identity\" lobbying. The city expressed its lobbying objective to replace the current city order in the official documents with the new ones, \"Seoul, Busan Incheon, Daegu and on.\" According to the past order, Incheon had been indicated behind Daegu among the municipalities and Incheon Metropolitan City, pursuant to the Local Autonomy Law, will petition for the change of order to enhance the esteem of city and reflect the reality of new emerging factors. However, there are no rules on how such an order must specify among the cities in Korea. The City ministry of government administration and home affairs is considering those important factors, e.g., the launch timing of cities and metropolitan urban population, economic size in assigning the rank order for major cities. On this criteria, the order should be from the Seoul Metropolitan City, Busan, Incheon, Daegu, Gwangju, and Ulsan. Now Incheon outpaced Daegu from all economic indicators, and because now the situation is reversed, the official argued that the order should be changed. For example, he told, \"Incheon area was with the population of 1.14 million people in 1981, but in March, it grew at 2.96 million people. Comparatively, Daegu is 2.51 million in 2013. The regional gross domestic product (GRDP) also showed that Incheon overwhemed Daegu between 4.6 trillion and 44.8 trillion won (Korean dollars).....Incheon suggested to send a memorandum to the ministry of central government asking Incheon to be placed ahead Daegu in the official documents and in terms of written notation on various statistical data The modifications by the government is necessary and something urgent to practice a guided official policy with the change of rank and notation based out of reality. The context of petition can well be understood that the officials assigned with the responsibility, who has both zeal and knowledge that he knows much about the changed reality in number and statistics and that he also is enthusiastic with his local city. The issue, however, was reported that the petition will be unlikely to be accepted. The implication is that the administrators of central government are highly blended or adapted with the passion and quality of issue, as well as the probable arousal of Daegu citizens (Dewey, 1938). This kind of issue simply has a rich flavor of qualitative approach that the history and context would be more powerful. For example, London often is illustrated ahead of Paris in describing the stories upon the beginning of world hegemony of Britain. For more outdated stories related with the medieval times or so, Paris may come ahead and the kind of stories related with the theme of Paris, such as culinary or arts may also come ahead London (Gergen, 1994). The stories may arise from the context or event that would be host by some country, then, the rank order to come may be purposeful as if the sampling is conducted in the qualitative method, e.g., the last in the Olympics and the first in the newspaper articles. The host country would enter as last with a picket into the stadium, and we note the Key Resolve with the Korea-US practice of military training, not that of US-Korea in order. I suppose that the officials in this case is naïve and too simplistic that his intended goals are improbable to success because there underlie an aspect of qualitative variants. Given it being a public agenda or issues of government, the odd of success may increase since the quantitative data may say more than does it in the context of newspaper reporting or research worked unofficially. Even the Korean government, however, seems not to alter at one time decision that the order will be rearranged notwithstanding the acid local response from Daegu. If the stakeholders continue to disagree on blending or adaptation of various factors for the conclusion, the issue might be rendered by the kind of public voting. As we progress toward the mixed approach, the news story illustrated between the two factors (populace or economic size and history or passion of local people) and the importance of qualitative dimension blended for Koreans. At this point, I would imagine how the qualitative researchers are to be blended with the data or themes if he is requested to evaluate the most publicly appealing new order. As we see, it is unquestionable that the qualitative research cannot be characterized as of one type, attested to by the multi-vocal discourse surrounding qualitative research today (Sarroub, 2005). However, they would stand on the common footing, (i) perspectives about philosophical, theoretical, and ideological stances (ii) three interconnected circles -the approach of inquiry, research design procedures, and philosophical and theoretical frameworks and assumptions (Creswell, 2013). The interplay of these three factors contributes to a complex, rigorous study. Blending or adaptation also is a friendly concept with evaluation that we can consider three approaches of evaluation to be applied to the order dispute or post-decision cure for the cities and local people. The government may decide a certain order as official, and may seek the programs to be implanted to address the aftermath. Then the research could apply one of three evaluation methods. The formative evaluation is developmental that the researcher may have a focus how to improve and shape most effective program, project or policy. Process evaluation may be employed to look aspects such as completeness, fidelity and reach. Impact evaluation can relate to anticipated changes in participants, organizations and policies. A blended, yet systemic, approach to evaluation allows data to be gathered that would otherwise be lacking if only one approach was adopted. This blended approach can be adapted to become a layered framework, integrating post decision promotion with key stakeholders of participants, organizations and the community.

Opening Statement Years ago, the office of the prime minister broke the first tape of official duties in the new government complexities located Sejong city. The rezoning in the distant city from Seoul was planned that will relieve of the overcrowded metropolitan and regionally balanced development. In the article titled \"Workers Lament Leaving Seoul,\" the Wall Street Journal, one of major newspapers in the US, reported that raising the plan for the city, 100 miles off Seoul, led to the kind of upheaval in society, and affected tens of thousands of officers. Many civil servants, in fact, do not want to leave his former Seoul, as enjoyed by a spouse or children, which had been well served of the concern and need for those living in Seoul. Mr. Yoo, who worked in the ministry of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, one of the six central government agencies, had moved to Sejong city, and his work was transferred last October. A number of officers changed their job due to the reason that separated their living of families. The newspaper introduced the context of plan, from the election pledge of former President Roh Moo-hyun and the unconstitutionality decision of Korean Constitutional Court about the change of national capital city (Cha, 2104). However, previous administrations had neglected that no impacts are discussed in the consultation process for the front-line officers, who should move to the distant city, and most of apartments built by private construction companies for such massive moving now are empty for the officers seeking other employment. The news from the US source is merely a part of story in terms of biological human resources in South Korea. A considerable number of desk or rank officers actually have managed their professional lives in the nomad pattern of responsibility, for example, the congressmen for the national assembly, ranked officers in the major public enterprises or organizations, and faculty members of local universities. Nevertheless, their context or stories are seldom concerned formally, although the implicit or informal lives are well to be contacted within the community and workplace. It is also related with the improvement of system and institution in terms of public administration. Mr. Jeong, the speaker of national assembly recently attended the video conferencing demonstration held at 11th Congress. Jeju governor and Mr. Jeong, through the tripartite videoconference demonstrations with Gangwon governor, expressed their interest \"Congress videoconferencing demonstration may be applied to the Sejong city departments that can support earlier efforts to reduce administrative costs due to efficiency,\" The deputy prime minister, Choi, after taking his duty of official service, also pledged to keep the promise of government that it will streamline the debate of the changes and solutions suggested by the employees (2014). The government, he furthered, will try to make the moved officers to settle and procure the stable working environment. The principal wishes and expectations of officer target circuit staffing and personnel exchanges. If they do not have these particular changes, they just will continue working in a new job for their future. The officials from one ministry said, \"The personnel exchanges will actively solve the difficulties that could stop outflow of officers to other jobs or alleviate their personnel grievances.\" B. Background of the Study The research in this area seems quite understudied for possibly many reasons. For example, the college professors are generally considered to be autonomous with authority and leadership than merely a part of component or passive research subject. They are expected to be fullest with their responsibility and perfection, who are professionally standardized from his intrinsic of role activity. They are, for example, a living international trade law, which could be said of professors on the international trade law. They are economist or chemist and math expert who share a common quality to the national and international standard. Their personal chores or individual trait is not a concern of common people or student, and even the university or governmental administration of education. They are same with the high school teachers in terms of their role to breed the school students, but can be distinguished for their ultimatum of his field of expertise, which may cause them to be excluded as a passive research subject. Second, they would like to avoid telling their personal story and feel of identity during his professional lives because of their general pride and adherence with a social esteem. We may have a distinct group of politically oriented professors, what is called polifessor in Korea, who may be sanguine if we would investigate them. This context would not be plausible to relate with the professors of local university for my story. Third, the investigation would not bring a pleasure, but could mainly disclose the negative side of his living mode that may be questioned of his loyalty or faith with the professional ethics. This aspect of research coverage could be similar with the new officers of Korean government who should commute weekly to report for their office, in which this point can also be seen a factor of understudies on that group. Fourth, they may not be interested in this kind of research to spoil a vast time as a participant and eventually could hinder on their time and energy devotion to research and preparation of lecture. Nevertheless, I have developed an interest and the meaning or narrative of their stories who would be a nomad professor possibly for more success and professional accomplishment as we sense-might be scientifically evidenced –with the Jewish people. In terms of research method, the terms or words are placed on central focus in terms of qualitative methodology, which could be flexible onto the progress of research operation. The word, nomad, may have an earlier origin within the European ancestors (Phillips, 1965). Now it may be used to describe the massive users of webpage for interactivity within the campus or captures a tenured faculty who devote their labor as an adjunct professor (Hess, 2002; Norton, 2001). The exact meaning of word depends on the use of authors, who would intend to semantically denote its concept. For example, the author may define \"I will take it as a prototype of men or women of ideas.\" A scholarly dealings on the word also sparsely be present to discuss the network analysis and ethnographic problems of regional clan and could be used to describe the nomad citizenship in terms of free market and labor issue (Douglas, Johansen, 2006; Holland, 2011). This simply shows that the term is not much used, while it very precisely can define the scope of local professors in my case. The dealings besides the definitional issue of nomad, apparently are also limited concerning the inquiries of faculty and professionals, notwithstanding it being national or international at scale. C. The Problem Statement The space of college and university is a distinct arena of public interaction where the students and instructors have a discourse and exchange of their views and ideas, who grow and learn. The students would acquire the knowledge of his disciplines and prepare to form a basis for the employment as well as humanity or social views on life-time impact. The professors would earn an income to subsidize their living as well as perform his professional ambition on instruction and research (Patton, 2002). The professors generally are churned on their specific locality, who has a personal basis on that specific locality, such as residence or educational background. Often the professors are expected of their unitary coherence by the campus community over every aspect of his personhood and loyalty. Nevertheless, it is actually undeniable that some of professors are discrete and should be active between his professional duty and personal mode of being (Laureate Education, 2010e). They have to commute two or three hours weekly exploiting a short stay in time for the consortium and pleasure with their family members. X University is located in Kwangu-ju, a southern part of South Korea, which comes to reach by three hours driving from Seoul, a capital city of Korea. There are many other local universities at the similar distance from Seoul, and the college professors of these local universities would be considerable at number, who have to commute weekly from his Seoul homes. In this guess, they are not only discrete, but also would be a fair component of college education in Korea. As the college education is an important process of national administration or public education, their identity and mode of lives would not only interest us, but also should be a useful touchstone to form any public policy of college education (Tierney, 1988; Tierney, 1994). The research comes into interest that was provoked with a general apprehension and expectation of people about an abstract imagery of research and class performance (Hess, 2002). The college professors are generalized with the specific expertise and professional background, and their social lives as well as elements of personal living had not been closely investigated (Tierney, 1988; Tierney, 1994). More interestingly, their specific backdrop or living mode would not be merely a social matter, but could be related with the educational effect and his or her professional growth in his field of expertise. D. The Purpose of the Study The investigation on their identity and living mode would increase the awareness of public, professors, and administrators on the nomad professors, and may expand into other nomad professionals nationally or internationally. For example, the officers of Korean government at the movement of new government complex located in the remote local city may be qualitatively investigated to assist with shaping the strategy of personnel resources. In this case, the theme might be a nomad officer perhaps largely captured under the umbrella term of nomad professional. The investigation may expand into international dimension, i.e., how the demography or geographical specificities of nation would make them differ in size and distribution. We may also expect the future research concerning the motivating factors for increase or decrease of nomad professor or comparative studies between the national nomads and shape of international mobility. Most importantly, their identity and living mode would have an extent of educational effect and professional performance, which is a secondary concern of this research plan (Corcoran & Clark, 1984). The vignette on the formula of purpose statement below seems an exemplar as illustrative to clearly convey the intention of qualitative researcher (2013). The purpose of case study in terms of nomad professors of local university in Korea is to understand and describe their identity and living mode in terms of impact on their personhood, social existence and professional accomplishment for the nomad professors at the X University. At this stage of the research, nomad professors will be generally defined as the long distance commuters weekly or in period, who are distinguishable with the professors of general expectation. E. Research Questions According to Creswell on the qualitative research plan, the research questions normally are prepared with one or two central questions and five or six sub-questions (Creswell, 2009). The central question to deal with my purpose of research is \"Who are the nomad professors?\" and \"How do they deal with their responsibilities and manage a personhood or social existence?\" Both questions had been designed to illuminate their identity and living mode encompassing their personal, social and professional context of behaviors or performance of responsibilities. These two central questions would be divided into several sub-questions dealing with the components of central question. The structure of questions can be presented as follows; (A) Who are the nomad professors? 1. What characterizes the nomad professors? 2. How do we properly make them distinct from their peers with one settled residence? 3. How do we differentiate other professionals of similar identity or living mode? (B) How do they deal with their responsibilities and manage a personhood or social existence? 1. How do they manage their personhood or social existence? 2. How do they perceive or consider them with their counterparts or other professionals in the context of teaching performance? 3. How do they perceive or consider them with their counterparts or other professionals in the context of research performance? 4. How do they perceive or consider them with the counterparts or other professionals in the context of university administration? 5. How do they perceive or consider them with the counterparts or other professionals in the context of his overall professional lives? F. Theoretical or Conceptual Framework The role of theory in researching the nomad professors for the local university of Korea seems to be conceived from the general purview and those concerned between the case studies and theoretical framework (Flinders, Mills, 1993; Laureate Education, Inc., 2010f). From the above explanation, therefore, I can present a concept map to elucidate the role of theory ---including four philosophical assumptions, various interpretive frameworks, concerning the qualitative research or case studies of nomad professors. I also illustrate some of details for them as follows. Figure 1 Concept Map of Theoretical Inquiries Figure 2 Illustrations and Research on the Nomad Professors Illustrations Philosophical Assumptions Axiological • What is the role of values? • (i) efficacy and productivity of university • (ii) Participatory paradigm and democracy of campus • (iii) informal society and social harmony theory • (iv) personal, social and professional identity theory Interpretive Framework Transformative Frameworks • A knowledge on the university faculty is not neutral and the issue of nomad professors reflects the power and social relationships within society • The purpose of study is knowledge construction of nomad professors and to aid people to improve the society Are Variables or Hypotheses are Extensive as the Quantative Studies?/The Second Role of Theory/Exploratory Case Studies/heory as an Ending Point? Tranformative Framework/Postmodern Perspective/Critical Theory/Queer Theory Ontological/Epis temological/Axio logical/Methodol ogical Use of Theory The Second Role of Theory • Many theories guide the importance of nomad professors and their issues • the researcher himself is a crucial agent to deal with the issue, not a dispassionate and objective observer. • The theory tends to govern the written accounts of research findings on the nomad professors • The research on nomad professors will take the tone of advocacy and aura of distinct cultural group The literature review was conducted that there were sources of literature to deal with the social identity and lives of minority group within the community (Phenice, Griffore, 2000). For example, Van Dijk focused on discourse analysis and understanding ethnic and racial inequality in society. Kingsbury and Scanzoni describes that much of our knowledge for minority group – as focused on the ethnic minority families – is grounded in theories of structure and function. Raigin and Hein questioned that the studies in this sort is quick to investigate and make an adaptation with the prevalent cultural stereotypes, which is received as a point of consideration for the quality and credibility of my research. It required that the data collected from the nomad professors, deans of department and housewives or other stakeholders should not be truncated or biased with only little methodological substance. Marger also delineated the flaws of using a comparative or cross-societal framework of ethnic minority families, and Billingsley criticized the mainstream of narratives that the poor and powerless were often compared with others more fortunate (2000). In pursuit of research theme on nomad professors, the ecological approach is considered as most useful and effective tools to describe and interpret our theme. It is based on the concept of familial relationship to analyze the social phenomenon and with the skepticism or distrust of traditional social identity theory. The rationale for my choice is quite obvious in terms of aspects and intrinsic. First, the colleges and universities traditionally had been viewed as quasi-family nature of community in which they share and exchange with the compassion and common purpose or direction as well as for the socialization and happiness (Bowen, 2015). Second, the teaching and research are presumed as if the parental and brotherly relationships essentialize on their performance. They collaborate for more competitive research and they indoctrinate their disciples with love and affection. Third, they generally are not dominated by the pecuniary interest unlike the context of secular world, but the giving or charity as well as school psychic of gratuity and generosity would be more powerful or practiced. The essentials of this system underlies (i) the relationships between family members, (ii) patterns of reciprocal influences embedded in networks of environments (iii) family behavior in terms of resources and energy exchanges21 (iv) decisions of the family and process of transforming, utilizing, and managing these resources (v) adaptation activities to reach certain outcomes, such as to improve their quality of life (Phenice, Griffore, 2000). This approach, therefore, underscores a focus on the dynamics of process relationships than risks or assets. The three key elements on this framework are composed of inputs, throughputs and outputs. For example, throughput refers to behaviors, techniques, strategies, or, more generally, approaches used to transform or utilize the resources that flow through the 21 The cycle turns beginning with take-in of resources through the production of human energy, outputs in this frame. Inputs flow from the resources, say, energy and information. family, which requires more careful definition and considerable elaboration than other two. It is especially relevant with the research of nomad professors, meriting a critical attention that Inputs, throughput, outputs, and structures are defined within environments. Where the environments in this context include three dimensions, i.e., the human-built environment, the social-cultural environment, and the natural-physical environment, I may apply this frame to the research plan (Wallace, 1970). The families in my case simply are the stakeholders and subjects of research, which include the nomad professors, other professors, campus administrators, families of NPs, students, and local people among others. The theory of family ecological system advised me to trace the input, throughput and output over the codes I have developed in eight words. It also relates the issue of data analysis and write up. For example, a complicated nature of matrix was developed to produce the three themes in my case, which are leadership, participation and difference. That was never an easy process, but the observations made of the whole of data analysis, such as memoing, journal writing, coded results, gradually could develop into preliminary descriptive and interpretive categories (Wolcott, 1990b). The work on the analysis of interview had culminated that identified connections and develop the pattern codes, determined the basic themes by examining clusters of comments (from respondents) and memos (from the researchers), and finally delineated predominant themes. These predominant themes would be a basis for writing up the data, and discuss the general properties of thought and action in the group (van Manen, 2006). G. Nature of the Study (a) Design Paradigm. Creswell suggested self-reflexive questions to evaluate the beginning part of qualitative research (2013). For example, we can ask \"how can the problem statement be best written to reflect one of the approaches to qualitative question?\" The researchers should not merely plan on tentative research problem, but need to consider a practical aspect of research operation. In that concern, the facile frame simply enmeshed into traditional five approaches would guarantee its feasibility and practicability since those five approaches generally are convinced of success with the long period of professional experiences and convention. The problem statement in my case simply shows that the focus group or ground theory of approach could well base the following research operation with the in-depth interviews or close observations over time period. And the journal writing through the research could be practiced to enrich the stories, which demystifies the focus group and decenters the traditional scope of group awareness (Denzin, Lincoln, 2012). The authentic profile of qualitative research may relate self with the concerned target group of research, so that we may receive \"tell me your story\" as if the qualitative researcher would be a theme itself. This may be most convivially present in the ground theory, and it would be the case of this research plan. Creswell likes to think about the research problem as coming from \"real life\" issues or from a gap in the literature, or both. Personal experience with an issue or a job-related problem would be a popular source for qualitative plan along with the scholarly literature and an advisor's agenda (2013). I had an experience to deal with the theme of Korean Constitutional Court as my advisor had that area of expertise. In this case, personal experience and jobrelated problem sprang to compose my research plan. The deficiencies of literature could be a useful defense that I have exerted on the present status of research theme above. Barritt also gave an insight that the rationale for the research of social science is not the discovery of new elements, but heightening of awareness for experiences which has been forgotten and overlooked (2013). This aspect is a crucial motivator to structure the research plan. I also hopefully expect that the research is to create dialogue leading to better understanding of the way things appear to someone else and improvements in practice. Design. As seen, the research questions would comprise two central questions and eight sub-questions and can be most salient of the characteristic of case studies. Figure 3 Characteristics and Research on the Nomad Professors Characteristics Narrative Research Phenomenology Grounded Theory Ethnography Case Study Focus O O O Type of Problem Best Suited for Design O O Discipline Background O O Unit of Analysis O O O O Data Collection Form O O Data Analysis Strategies O O Written Report O O Rationale for the design. It is generally known that some area of social processes can only be revealed with the qualitative inquiry, which also pertains to my ambit of study on the nomad professors (Creswell, 2009). Consider if we develop such research design on the basis of quantitative studies, the inquiry may turn too mechanic or superficial that many nomad professors or stakeholders might be tedious or could not share. In this plan, we may infer several hypotheses from the literature review, prepare the scaled questionnaires, select the sample population and conduct public survey, as well as analyze and discuss the survey results. It is quite streamlined process to be expedited with the statistic aids of SPSS and on the description of general populace, what are nomad professors in this case. The elements of research in this case come as distinct that they are qualified group and their action or behavior has a powerful influence. We commonly like to know how they are processed over the personal, social and professional lives and what implications the findings would suggest on aspects, of course, including the campus or public administration (Crotty, 1998). They are researchers and key players with the socialization of campus and even community at large. It is not incorrect that they engineer the society or nation to promote communication and intellectual sharing. They are hardly the persons that can be curtailed with five scale questions as if their book or articles are implied. The curiosity in the case involves not with static understanding of general populace, but with the kind of process in current, dynamic, characteristic and even prospective. (b) Methodology Site. The public setting for this observation arises from the X University located at Gwang-ju South Korea, and the key places which bear a significance to reproduce the enegery and vigor of nomad professors including Express Bus Terminal, KTX, private residences, campus tennis court. The particpants in my case study are drawn from the key stakeholders of research, who could provide an vaulable information leading to the contexts and stories, which include the nomad professors, settled professors, university adminditarors of personnel management officer and dean of colleges as well as other stakeholders, such as housewives of NP. I may present one example for the picture of sites, and will delineate the sampling size and strategy (Conwell, 1917). Participants and sampling. As seen above, the research plan on the nomad professors of CU has three major research questions and eight sub-questions. It has most traits of case studies among the five major qualitative approaches within the Creswell's. In corresponding with the general tips dealing with my context of case studies, the sampling strategy, sample size and length of interview time were determined. Most important in the qualitative studies is the trait that the iterative journey, including such as daily feedback and re-tracking of data, recordation of information, through the analysis of data and even new framing of structure of thesis until the research purpose and goals are satisfied (Laws & McLeod, 2015). This aspect of qualitative research is due to its intrinsic dealing with the qualitative information, to say, open nature of inquiry, dynamic aspect of information, trait of data collection, as well as its deep basis on inductive reasoning. Hence, for example, the chain or snowball sampling begins offhand with a random sample in the growing quest to locate the information-rich people or cases that will be researched. It is growing and dynamic while initial sample design may go as less significant. Secondly, the saturation or redundancy in consideration of sample size is critical standard that the qualitative researchers almost always are destined that must be resolved. It often is disclosed at the point when the researcher realizes the size of sample should be large enough to leave you with \"nothing left to learn (Miles, Huberman, 1994).\" In other words, they come to hit at this point that no new concepts will be emerging even if more interviews are to be conducted. This implies, on one hand, that the validity and credibility can be ensured in this way other than that of quantitative studies. On the other, the initial thought on sample size is not automatically controlling through the end of research in the case of qualitative studies. Hence, it is dynamic and flexible, and iterative with reflection within the whole structure of research. Along with the tentative proposal, the initial sampling strategy was summarized in the box form beneath. Figure 4 Sample Size and Sampling Strategy Focus Groups and Sample Size Sampling Strategy Nomad Professors 8-10 The purposeful Sampling/Intensity Sampling/Typical Case Sampling/Criterion Sampling  Most Successful and Failed (Often Transferred) NP  Female and Male NP  Senior and Junior NP  Rich and Poor NP Settled Professors 2-3 Critical Cases Sampling/Politically Important Cases  Recruiting Professor  A Closest Peer Administrators and Other Informative Samples 3-4 Purposeful Random Sampling/Operational Construct Sampling  Dean of Department  Vice Dean of Faculty Board  Spouses of NP  Other Participant Figure 5 Number of Interviewees and Length of Interview Number of Interviews Length of Each Interview 13-17 40 minutes-1 hours Data collection methods. According to Creswell, we can find four methods for collecting qualitative data, which covers the interviews, observations, and review of documents (Thomas, Nelson, Silverman, 2015). The data collection in the qualitative studies has several traits (i) the methodology is planned and pilot-tested before the study (ii) the researcher typically has some type of framework that determines and guides the nature of the data collection (iii) it is time-intensive process that should not be expected to be quick. The interview is undoubtedly the most common source of data in qualitative studies and we had an experience on the interview protocol and interview questions in the Mini-project. There are several types of interview including the person-to person-format as most prevalent, as well as group interviews and focus group. Although the interview is conducted in types including a highly structured style as used in the socio-demographic research and in which the questions is determined before the study, the qualitative researchers usually conduct an unstructured, open-ended interview and take interview notes or audiotape the interview and finally transcribe it. Nevertheless, the drawback is not inconsiderable that the machines can malfunction at any time, can create awkward and intrusive impression. This makes its use infrequently than taking notes. It often would be ineffective and least preferred that the interviewer tries to remember the interview responses and writes down afterward what was said in the interview. In my qualitative plan, the 13-17 interviews are planned to be conducted in which most of occasions will be person to person format and e-mail or telephone interviews might be alternative to supplement against the challenges and difficulties during the operation of research schedule. The kind of guidelines explored to make the interviews a best practice will be kept through the completion (Laureate Education Inc., 2010b; Laureate Education, Inc. 2010c). The examination of documents will be another important way of data collection since the issues of nomad professor could be unraveled more extensively by examining the school record and newspapers or campus communications. Keeping a journal during the research study will also provide a crucial part of evidence to be incorporated into the analysis of data and visualization or presentation (Emerson, Fretz, Shaw, 1995). For the key participants, it would be trusted to keep a journal or diary during the research study, in which they play the role likely same as collaborator in the field work. Some participants will be asked to contribute the personal letters for the use of data, which also can be precious to understand their true and life moment of experiences or feelings. Official memos of campus leader and dean of departments, minutes from the meeting of faculty board, records of teaching and research performance, and archival material for rewards and disciplines as well as the accomplishment of NPs within the administrative position over period would be a source of data that constitutes the data collection method in my study. Observation is another way to collect the data in my qualitative research and field notes are taken throughout the observations with a focus on what is seen. The issue of observation method would challenge since it requires a prolonged amount of time in the setting and could possibly be obtrusive although it would be the secondary nature of data collection to complement with the interview result for the effect of impression and highlight of focused viewpoints (van Manen, 1990). One recommendation is that the researcher has to prepare so as not to be a stranger with a pad and pencil or camera. I would be more active to be a participant and will gather field notes by conducting an observation as participant rather than non-participant (Ginsberg, 2009). It also is a good idea to schedule for a pilot visit a couple of days before the initial data collection since it could facilitate the process for the participants to become accustomed to having the researcher around. It is expected of several artificial and natural settings for observation to consummate at reports of what goes on when a visitor is present. The observation could render the researcher to cost time and energy, for example, obtaining a permission and schedule to arrange, and emergency to change his plan so that it is not desirable to take it longer so as to make the visitors considered no longer a novelty. Other possible data collection method has been summarized in the box form below, which is flexible about its implementation depending on the iterative process to find its needs. The reactivity to employ those various methods would be developed gradually according to the stage of my qualitative studies. Data analysis and interpretation. In using the techniques of data analysis for my research plan, I have considered a scope of methods that are of types to deal with the specific context of research and sorts of qualitative approaches (Bernad, Ryan, 2009).. Interestingly, the difference of methods is just a matter of extent and would not be so rigid, but versatile that can be applied across the type of five qualitative approaches. To say, my research can be classed as a case study, but many helpful tips arise from the methods regardless of its prominent use within certain other approaches. For example, the photo data of an empty parking lot in the X University may be analyzed in narration with the semiotics that can be parceled into my themes. The discourse and narrative analysis as well as hermeneutics would be used to analyze the interview result collected from the nomad professors, deans of department, housewife of NPs, as well as settled peers (Ratcliff, 2015). Also noteworthy is it that data analysis can benefit much from the computerized software programs, for example, use of nodes in NVivo, coding of various sorts of data, or coding matrix as combined with the quantitative data. The text search query is fairly implicating to construct the theme (Kelle,1995). Given it being assigned for this weekend, I may brief on two methods of data analysis to illustrate my case of qualitative research. The typology is a method that is principled and often embedded within the attitude of qualitative researchers. It includes the elements often centered on the work frame of researcher, such as a classification system or categories and is taken from pattern and themes or other kinds of groups of data. The interview results and other data collected from the field work in my case can be winnowed into categories or classification (Ratcliff, 2015). The constant comparison is widely used and developed in late 1960's, and especially applicable to the grounded theory. The method requires a researcher to look at document, such as field notes, which is considered central and as a basin of generating a new theory (Sanjek, 1990). He also looks for indicators of categories in events and behavior, as well as compares codes to find consistencies and differences, in which NVivo has strength with automated process of analysis. The applications to my study had come in part with the following table. Figure 6 Exemplary Application of Principles to the Research Plan Principles Some Aspect of Applications Good Ideas to Focus the Study and Analyze the Data This principles and considerations are foundational when we think of qualitative research in general. Since the research has to be original and creative, the raw data are a crucial component, but never convey any meaningful stories or contexts for themselves. It is important to create a focus which constitutes an essential feature of data analysis. The research questions and existing literature as well as data itself are a basin to pursue a focus or lens of analysis. I may have developed five points of study focus, which covers identity of NPs, professional, social, personal and public administration. It basically relied on the research questions, and alluded to the needs of discipline. In the process, I have used the Ryan and Bernad's social science queries, for example, that the general goals of discipline, such as efficiency or productivity and new thought on the focus of organizational members are included to make a theme. What to be Coded Behaviors to be coded in the research plan generally include the professional service and enduring social activities of nomad professors. Specific acts or events would be a surprisingly enormous amount that can be found in the interview transcriptions, school records and photos with descriptions and thoughts. Activities to be coded may cover the kinds of incident as the administrative staff or head of unit and department, which are of a longer duration and involve other people within a particular setting or strategies. Meanings may be found in the journal writings of researcher and key participants as well as articles or book chapters in PDF format. The state may be coded to disclose the nexus between the NPs and their general conditions to affect the aspect of my qualitative inquiry. Hierarchical Coding The hierarchical coding is indispensable to progress on or perfect the theme and story. That is my case, of course, that happiness, satisfaction, familial, and support would be friends as a sub-code capped under the parent code of \"personal.\" The efficiency, productivity, recruitment, system inclusion and goals of administration will be submissive to the parent code of \"public administration.\" Figure 7 Layers of Analysis H. Limitations Although the elements are suited with the qualitative method, we see that the limitations exist. Since it requires the extensive work within the particular contexts in considerable depth, the collection and especially the analysis of materials, compiled with various forms of data, can be time-consuming and therefore expensive (Creswell, 2009). As we see, the training and experience are more than critical factor in this case, but the training courses in Korea or experienced researchers or participants are hard to find. This aspect generally will impede the progress of my research that should be carefully responded within the plan. Another limitation can arise from the credibility or trustworthiness since the qualitative method is conducted on the basis of small number of participants. On this attribute, other academic researchers, practitioners and policy makers can less likely take the findings seriously. One illustration depicts a frustration of British researcher, who had been engaged with the study of racial discrimination in a local British job market for young adults (Griffin, 1994). It was a six-moth qualitative interview with groups of young Asians in Leicester, but the County Council, in response to the findings documented on the widespread experiences of racism, did not commit the study, but instead, funded primarily quantitative survey of young adult's educational attainments and employment histories on comparison. As we expect, there are reasons for this consequence. For example, the policy makers, even sympathetic counselors or council officers in this case, like to turn their focus on the characteristics of target group rather than the discrimination embedded on the structure or process that they DataBase Interview Data Codes and Themes Greatness Sufference Social Familial Overcome Education Excell Teacher Structure to the Discipline (Public Administration) Socio-Psychological Psychological hardly can handle (1994). They also prefer to quote statistics or quantitative evidence that can be more facile shared with his or her constituents. The qualitative findings would be wellnigh and echoing, but may be imperfect without the kind of political catchphrase on the quantified evidence. It is thematic and divulges the contexts, stories, and social processes that the quantitative inquiry comes hard to deliver (Crotty, 1998). Nevertheless, they would be rather instant at the reelection possibility or would easily be enthralled into the simplistic sharing with the constituents. It may be in contrast with the routine preaching of high school teachers or intellectuals, \"Read the books for time, or \"You even do not read one book a year\" or \"The mouth is waned of mildew if we are not on pages even a day.\" In any case, the possibility of discount by the policy makers, in fact, is not negligible, but the kind of bad reality or challenge for the researchers on the qualitative method provided that their research work often is intended to change the community or prevailing perception (Noble, Smith, 2015). We also consider the limitations intrinsic with the objectivity and subjectivity discourse. It would be a myth that the qualitative researcher is always apolitical and objective, which is another basis to discount the qualitative research. Of course, the debate itself can also be the kind of queries concerned of politics quality and preference of quantitative method in which the mixed researchers could be interested. While we often say, \"men are a political animal\" citing the Aristotle's, it will be exciting to empirically test it within the methodological concern. So I may hypothesize to show between the two methods: (i) the dynamic society that is situated with the future and prospect, in terms of world politics and hegemony, may buy the qualitative piece more readily as I illustrated earlier involved with US government (ii) The static or countries of decline, in terms of world politics and hegemony, may be seen in this concern that the political or objective view may be preferred since their politics or society reached the kind of limitation as is22; (iii) the preference of qualitative studies in the research of US government is due to the diversity of society than the status of world politics. Then we may research the number of articles on each method and as complemented with the kind of qualitative interview deriving some implications involved with the preference of policy makers and the context of difference among the group of countries. Although we do not have empirical research, such as described by me, the subjectivity and objectivity view may sensibly approach within this assumption, to say, related with the political and human-oriented attribute. Of course, there are many possible illustrations or deep explications on this point, but the important thing is that the challenges are the kind of very probable reality for the qualitative researchers. Hence this aspect of shortcomings could only be improved with the elaboration of researchers to improve the quality, credibility and trustworthiness. The rigor and best possible way standard has always 22 In this assumption, we may suppose of the past hegemonies of world politics in contrast with the US (despite bior multi-polarity version of international politics), such as Britain, France, Germany or Japan. Japan might not be the case given Abe, the current prime minister intends to rise, and the international criticism surges proselytizing him to transform (they may not prefer to be static or viewed as country of decline). On another dimension, we may draw on other hypothesis that the US is the society of diversity in races or ethnicities that lead to three hypotheses. We can yield the number of two-method articles among the interested countries about the preference of method and factors to affect the outcome. In other analogy, we may think of stare decisis rule espoused by the judiciary of nations and leadership role of presidency. Let us assume if the president comes in hegemony, if separation of powers principle, than judiciary because of appointment power and general tendency of followership for the parties of appointing president. Which branch or responsible officers of outsourcing the research project would prefer the qualitative studies? Of course, the judiciary is not a researchbased organ in general -they explore the cases and conduct case analysis on the rule, hence vastly qualitative in nature of their main business -but they also may like to prefer the quantitative findings when they occasionally board on the administrative issues of court reform or others like the city counselors in Britain. to be minded of qualitative inquires. Hence the turn should be on the issue of improving the qualitative product. Lincoln and Guba suggested four criteria to evaluate the qualitative research in replacement of traditional terms of reliability and validity, which represents the elements of post-positivism and includes the credibility or trustworthiness, transferability, dependability and confirmability. For example, Credibility inquires if the results are believable, and can only be verified by the researchers and participants on their own unlike other criteria (Zamboni, 2015). In order to ensure the credibility of the research project, the techniques I can apply to gauge the accuracy of findings will include the data triangulation and through the multiple analysts and member checks. Even as researchers collect qualitative data, the dependability is not always guaranteed since the environmental circumstance is constantly changing (Noble & Smith, 2015). The use of external audits is my crucial strategy that I plan to obtain assistance from the outside experts, who review my data and challenge any of the assumptions. In this way, the research findings can be more rigorous to be consistent and replicable, which I believe to be measured by the standard that was conducted, analyzed and presented with the project. Overall, the rigor is often an important standard to evaluate the quality and credibility or trustworthiness, and the \"best possible way\" standard will be an effective overall yardstick to measure holistically the qualitative research (Campbell & Machado, 2013). Threats to quality are a major concern that I have deliberated to be addressed adequately with the strategies. I may illustrate some of them as below. Figure 7 Challenges and Strategies Challenges Strategies Constant comparison Constant comparison is the way to ensure the quality and credibility of qualitative research. It is part of process to establish his main theme or stories, but also can lead to the alternatives or other context of story with disconfirming evidence and perspectives. This process then eventually perfects the theme and can increase the credibility and trustworthiness of research. In my plan, the nomad and normal professorship is a point of constant comparison, for example. I could establish a comparison case, seek out similarities and differences across accounts to ensure that different perspectives are represented. Challenge of Description The interview may be arranged in Korean language so that the translation is considered yielding the maximum of best effect against the biases and ambiguities. It also is important to include rich and thick verbatim descriptions of participants' accounts to support findings.7The clarity is elementary to increase the quality and credibility of research. It has to be constantly practiced through the research project, for example, journal writings or memos, and descriptions of event and occurrences including the write up stage. The researcher demonstrates clarity in terms of thought processes during data analysis and subsequent interpretations. I. Ethical Concerns The ethical discourse has a root over history, for example, absolutists such as Kant and Rawls, utilitarian views as Mills, and virtue ethics derived from Aristotle. The absolutists proposed that ethical values exist in themselves and rules can be derived that apply to all. The utilitarian view stands on a more relativist stance and focuses on the importance of actor's consequences for the general good. The virtue ethics stresses the character of individual that we may see the internalized moral values of researcher as more critical in terms of ethics (Fox-Keller, 1985). Cronin also suggests the value-based model, in which relationships with the society as well as the care and responsibility of researcher are viewed as primary and most in emphasis. These thoughts will be applied to determine the course of research action and performance within the NPs project, and especially the Cronin's viewpoints would be very useful to maintain the ethical good for my research plan. First, my ethical concern has been given to the responsibilities to society so that I was brought to consider if my research aims both benefit and minimize the social harm. It is historically regrettable, as we see, that some research project was even powerful, but generated a negative consequence to harm the humanity and society at large. I had a good assessment about the crucial checkpoints before my research project will begin to operate; (i) balance of professional integrity with respect for national and international law (ii) respect of gender differences (iii) respect for all groups in society, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion and culture (iv) respect for under-represented social groups and care against marginalization or exclusion (v) concerns and care of relevant stakeholders and user groups. Beyond the responsibilities to the society, the researcher has to respect and maintain the professional expertise and standards. Those are the basic expectations to keep the quality and integrity of research professions, which covers, for example, the appropriate selection of research method with informed professional expertise, qualified team with expertise and support, avoidance of unwarranted material gain or loss, and falsification, fabrication, suppression or misrepresentation of data for factual accuracy (Denzin, Lincoln, 2012). Furthermore, the participants are crucial players in the qualitative research that had to be duly protected against the potential disadvantages of any individual or category of person. It also falls within my care list that the reporting and dissemination are carried out in a responsible manner. In order to ensure the points of ethical concern, I would plan, for example, that methodology and findings are open for discussion and peer review, and the regular meetings of key stakeholders and outside experts will be arranged through the stage of data collection and analysis. I consider it foremost that the participant should be voluntary and decisions are made from an informed position (Corti, Day, Backhouse, 2000). The confidentiality and anonymity of data also are viewed important and secured as appropriate on the treatment. In order to ensure the voluntary participation, the legal restriction will be surveyed. It is important to note that encouragement and persuasion can be received as pressure. The role of gatekeepers and management of proxy participants will be previewed in the context of my research plan ensuring the moral magic of consent. The consent form to suit my research on the nomad professors was attached as Exhibit. Overall, the researcher has to be aware of the ethical issues laden with the qualitative studies uniquely. Ethical considerations of qualitative research are empirical and theoretical and permeate the qualitative research process. Because of its depth and focused process, they touch on the complexities of researching private lives and placing accounts in the public arena, which requires of more endeavor and care beyond the abstract rules and principles. It also is noteworthy that inherent tensions are distinct in this method because of fluidity and inductive uncertainty as well as the increased command of good research ethics. J. Significance of the Study In terms of quality writing on the significance of the study, the researchers generally do good in practice by illuminating the importance of his work and the implications of research findings. Therefore, it constitutes the part of whole research piece, in which the researcher deals with his contribution to fill the knowledge gap, development of better theoretical models or better world views and often suggestion or guide for the future research. The impact of research also comes as a crucial component, which concerns of the academic or scientific community and the general public. In dealing with this part, the researchers often present the unique perspective drawn from his research work as coupled with the practical benefits of his findings, such as policy suggestion to inform decision makers or improvement of some aspect of people's lives or process to help environment. From the result of my study, I am able to make the several recommendations for the administrators and stakeholders (Denzin, Lincoln, 2012). Recognizing that the universities face a variety of issues, including multiple expectations in the areas of academic accomplishment, socialization, accountability, and personal satisfaction, the administrators additionally face the challenge of leading their campus through a variety of improvement initiatives that address all of the variables that impact to fill the gap between the NPs and regularly situated faculty (Lombardi, 2013). Inconsistency among staff members' knowledge and ability to deal with behavior challenges, coupled with the wide variety of needs and communications in the area of social, emotional, and behavioral pattern renders school administrators unprepared to meet the increasing challenges facing the competent and congruous faculty. Administrators commonly report that the use of non-interventions is effective, but that they can lose the opportunity of feasible improvement with the efficient methods and resources or support. The findings of this study point to five recommendations for addressing and improving the types of behavioral support that is critical for success of X University, and other similar or even large organizations of professionals, such as the government of Korea (Gergen, 1994). The administrators are recommended to hold the five alternatives through their planning: (1) collect and use data, (2) teach or share expectations explicitly, (3) develop consistent acknowledgment and consequence systems, (4) increase staff capacity, and (5) develop and make available a continuum of social and emotional services or sharing for the nomad professors or officers. I may advert on two of those. As we see over the behavioral studies, collecting consistent data and having a concurrent systemic procedure to analyze that data are paramount for increasing the effectiveness of any behavior support program. Almost of all of participants in this study who were interviewed stated that there is no formal system in this responsibility, but informally dealt within the friendly peers and concerned administrators. Through the quantitative data or qualitative data from the regular counseling at the expert contact center, it seems operative that the consistent, formalized processes of data collection could be compiled. It can enable administrators to understand better the complexities of data, and the types of concerns for which data can and cannot account. It can be referred to the department leadership in principal charge of NPs, and could be more refined in dealings through the development of a department-level matrix or profile. From this system of data sharing and review, the leadership teams, guidance department teams, and administrators could fully organize and understand the context of NPs on the various organizational goals. Further, it is viewed as important that the departments develop consistent acknowledgment and consequence Systems. The culture and socialization would more effectively be built-in by implementing a system that guarantees consistent acknowledgement of positive organizational behavior, as well as consistent consequences (Merton, Storer, 1979). That would make the department and campus predicable and focused on the success of stakeholders, as opposed to being merely disciplinary or discriminatory in nature. [Exhibit] CONSENT FORM You are invited to take part in a research study of nomad professors in the X University. The researcher is inviting the nomad and settled professors, campus administrators including a dean of college and housewives of nomad professors to be in the study. This form is part of process called \"informed consent\" to allow you to understand this study before deciding whether to take part. This study is being conducted by a researcher named Kiyoung Kim, who is a doctoral student at Walden University. If recruiting participants within the researcher's own workplace, an additional statement is required: you may already know the researcher as a faculty member of X University, but this study is separate from that role.

THE REPOSITORY OF SOCRATIC CONVERSATION [Week 1] Mark Chakwin Hello Kiyong, Thank you for your post. It was a lengthy clarion call for the place of qualitative research in scientific methods. ;-) While I must confess to finding some points a bit dense, your post was actually refreshing to read! Even though you cited Patton for a large part of your foundation, your style and content really echoed themes suggested in our reading by Creswell (2012). The world of qualitative research that you describe seems less sterile and less mechanical that the quantitative domain. Perhaps that is because of the injection of the researcher into the problem and the subjective nature of many facets of the qualitative paradigm. . . That's a point to amplify perhaps at some later point. Your paragraph titled \"An Excuse for Qualitative Studies\" first made me reflect on comments qualitative researchers have made about acceptance of their field. For example, Janesick (2011) notes how over time she first found reluctance, but then more understanding and (relatively) greater acceptance in the scholarly community for the tenants and promotion of the qualitative approach and courses. However, it was your linkage to literature and cinema that I thought were most apropos and fascinating. Of course, I immediately thought of Kurosawa's Rashomon, the classic film that did stretch cinematic themes into a subsequent reality –with psychologists and sociologists studying the Rashomon Effect as a routine part of their programs. So, too, exceptional literature has developing concepts like stream of consciousness as offered by Joyce in Ulysses (and again in the more dense Finnegan's Wake!). These also have been morphed into valid scholarly research themes by authors like Thurston (2010). So, thank you again for your post –and I look forward to studying with you and I know that your posts and discussions will stretch our thinking and certainly will aid and enhance my learning for our program! Thank you again! Mark References Creswell, J. W. (2012). Qualitative inquiry and research design: Choosing among five approaches: Sage. Janesick, V. J.

Cambridge University Press. Hi. Dr. Lee, Thank you for reading my post. Now in Korea, May, 2015, the MERS-CoV, a fatal disease from contagion, has been a news headline over the week that the Korean public have a worry for the possible detrimental impact and loss of lives. The rate of mortality is reported around 30 percent, which seems variable from any accompanied condition and circumstance. The patient age and health condition would affect how much it is fatal and harmful. Perhaps the competence and capabilities of medical service of nation would also factor the anti-spread effort and death rate of citizen. Even one medical professional in the TV forum told that the healthy and young persons will have a same experience with a cold although he is assumed of that disease. The context brings a good point of contrast between the quantitative and qualitative studies. 30 percent death rate from the disease may come within the quantitative findings over the vast of world region as collected from samples and empirical findings. The particularities of Korea and personal trait of possible victims within the zone of danger would be another strand that only could be explained with an in-depth concern than general statistics. Then we could utter it a qualitative nature of problem. The whole picture of research problem and social interest of risks on this case could be most comprehensible with the mixed type of understanding. Without the 30 percent knowledge or belief on its fatality, we could not apprehend the seriousness of problem. Without a consideration of the particularities and direct human subject, a possible victim of this case, we could not explain the tending outcome of low death rate in Korea. It seems to me that a direct human subject is any most discriminatory factor in understanding the essence of this disease. This does not say that the qualitative inquiry is superior to its counterpart, but implies that the human element is less generalizable. The medical research seems an effective discipline that was cross-sectioned both by natural and social science. Then we may ask if the healthy subjects could be generalized, but the answer would be, \"depending on the extent of commonality.\" \"Aboriginal,\" as I said, could be salient to divide the research coverage between two methods. Many issues of social science, thankfully, could have a tendency to be made common because the law and economic conditions would converge across the world, which supports the ground of quantitative studies. I am not determined to choose my method for the study, but the likelihood is that the mixed method is probable since the method is powerful to uncover the whole of research problem and solution. Respectfully. Your posting is very detailed and informative !Your closing paragraph is very insightful and sheds light on the fact that although there are clear differences between qualitative and quantitative approaches, some researchers choice between using qualitative or quantitative approaches actually has less to do with methodologies than it does with positioning oneself within a particular discipline or research tradition. Which research approach do you intend to employ for your study and why? Hi. Ashely, I have enjoyed your reading. The viewpoint that the qualitative reasoning use an inductive method to prove the thesis seems to generate a practical and realistic solution for unknown world. In the common law, the electronic sew had stricken the mind of judges which ultimately led to the product liability theory in law. The traditional tort liability was reframed to balance the bargaining power between the producers and consumers and intended on plausible justice for the two groups. The consumers were treated more favorably on various grounds, for example, the disparity of information and evidence once they enter a dispute in the context of modern mass production and mass consumption. The consumers would be a vulnerable group that the burden of proof may shift as a plaintiff in hard cases. The electronic sew merely would be one device of potential danger and threat on the body of users, which idea would later encompassed a principled scope of dangerous products or ultrahazardous activities as a matter of tort theory. Many objects and activities have fallen within the legal scope of product liability on the work of subsequent courts, which is inductive in method. The way of approach would generally be a common law method, while the principle would be tested in specific case in the civil law tradition. The two legal traditions, in analogy, seem to bear a same attribute with two methods when they engage writing a court reasoning. While the inductive reasoning contributes to theory building, the deductive reasoning would test the theory, analogically announced in the statutory provisions. We consider both ways to effectively complement within the cycle-qualitative studies, theory, empirical test, theory and so. What do you think if several hypotheses would be posited to prove the thesis by quantitative researchers? Is it a better way than beginning without hypotheses? Respectfully.

Comparison of Qualitative and Quantitative Research Approaches Similarity The Qualitative and Quantitative Research Methods share theoretical differences but are similar in many ways. Qualitative and Quantitative Research Approaches are very popular research methods. Moreover, they are the primary contributory research vehicles among various disciplines in gathering information on particular studies. Although both methods can stand on their own, it has been proven that the two methods are also successful when there are combined (Mixed-Method Research Approach). Both methods base their studies on generating data to prove a theory or explain phenomena. Both have strategies of inquiry that is important in terms of what research method would be most appropriate in answering a particular research question. \"So what you get from the continuum of inquiry would help you develop a research question. When you look at that research question, you think about what approaches do I need to answer this appropriately and validly (Laureate Education, 2010e).\" Difference In the quantitative method, observations are interpreted numerically. It collects data on predetermined instruments (Creswell, 2009). Meanwhile, the qualitative method looks at the observational significance, eliminates subjectivity, and conducts careful social interpretation among human subjects. Also, the theories differ in their methods of reasoning in which there is generalization about the connection in a Quantitative Research Method Approach. Unlike the quantitative deductive logic, the qualitative method utilizes an inductive reasoning. Thus, it focuses on factors moving from specific to general. Although both rely on questions to address their studies under investigation, those questions are structured differently. The Qualitative Method utilizes questions that are open-ended and semi-structured. Meanwhile, Quantitative uses close-ended structured questions. Even their sampling methods differ. The ultimate comparison would be justified solely by noting their differences is based on how data is composed and interpreted (numerical or non-numerical). Overall, it is evident that these research methods are theoretically different but share many similarities. References Creswell, J. W. (2009).

(Executive Producer). (2010e). Doctoral research: Preparing for qualitative research. Baltimore: Author. Hi. Philip, Thank you for the informative post. The qualitative research likely costs much time and expense in gathering the data and analyzing them. In contrast, the quantitative method seemingly requires as short a month of survey conduct and analysis of data. The discussion will follow to draw any meaningful findings to prove or disprove the theory. Nevertheless, the employment of quantitative studies depends on the disciplines and departments if it fits within their tradition of study and professional communication. What method do you think more appropriate if you like to know the attitude of congressmen on the East Asian diplomacy? Respectfully. Author: Philip Elekwachi Date: Wednesday, June 3, 2015 6:35:02 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 1 The difference in the use of research design of qualitative and quantitative design approaches depends could be based on the research claims of knowledge, strategy of inquiry and the methods applied in the process of research. Creswell, (2009) posits that the comparison between qualitative and quantitative research analysis employs different philosophical assumptions, strategies of inquiry and methods of data collection, including method of analysis and interpretation (p. 173). Both Research methods depends on and require the research question that require reasoning on the kinds of case study, self-assessment (qualitative approach) or either consisting of more experimentation-self-efficacy (quantitative approach) in any research study or project (Laureate education, 2010e ). Researchers in the qualitative approach refers to the meanings, concepts, characteristics , symbols metaphors and description of things ( Berg, 2007) Qualitative research is often conducted in the field, allowing direct interaction with the people being studied in the study context. Researchers collect data in qualitative research collect data through examining documents, observing behavior or involving in the interviewing of participants. Data from both research methods are viewed differently. While quantitative data emerges from statistical, experimental and quasi-experimental analysis, qualitative data is mostly influenced by a researcher's theoretical orientation. Most qualitative datacollection techniques include interviews, focus groups, ethnography case studies and historiography. Taking account of the reliability and validity of outcome in quantitative research projects appears different from qualitative projects. Qualitative validity is based on the determining if findings are accurate from the standpoint of the researcher, the participant and the readers (Creswell, 2009, p.190). Quantitative outcome reliability and validity depends on degree and statistical components of evidence supports the data in the analysis which is believed to correspond to series of experiments.

Cambridge University Press. [Week 2] Hi. Rudolphe, Thank you for reading my post. Your point is precise that the short and clear purpose statement would help to orient the audience facile and penetrating. The formula developed by Creswell also could have a greater use for the researcher to ask himself what the research is honed of. That seems an indispensable process in the initial stage whether or not the formula sentences would be expressed or implied. In any way, I am afraid if my beginning section is lengthier that needs to be trimmed? Respectfully. Author: Rodolphe Missinhoun Date: Wednesday, June 10, 2015 4:12:52 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 2 Hello Kiyoung, Thanks for your detailed post. Do you consider that the purpose statement should integrate all these elements or some might be included in the research probleme statement as suggested by Creswell (2013). It seems that this is somehow confusing when one compares Creswell (2009) with Creswell (2013) with regard to the elements of the purpose statement. The one you provided seems for me to be in line what we were thought in RSCH 8100. But Creswell (2013) simplified the purpose statement to two sentences. Rodolphe Hi. Jennifer Williams, Thank you for the helpful post. The research seems very useful for the policy makers in this area of concern. A less productivity or resilience within the collaborations of two entities seems highly probable to be connected with the trait or culture of actors involved. An extent of support or aids and systemic scheme of collaborations will not be guaranteed of success as we may illustrate in the grants or aids of OECD for African nations. The corruption of leadership and lawless dictatorship culture may be most prone as a culprit. H. W. Kim was detailed in today's newspaper article in Korea, who was one of Korean Hoover and militaristic potent around 1960's. His betrayal against the J.H. Park's rule is notorious and was profiled in the memoir of J.P. Kim. All three are core leaders of 1961 coup, who actually reigned Korea in 1960 and 1970's. The first Kim had exiled and took a witness stand of the Fraser committee in early of 1970's. He testified that he fled to US with small money, but the convincing evidence gathered by one US source suggested a tremendous amount of foreign bank account, perhaps unlawfully exploited after his rise as a coup leader. This illustration seems to have a pertinence that the cultural aspect of leadership involved with the foreign aids and corruption are often relevant with the underdeveloped economies. Other implication may be that this kind of inquiry would be more properly excavated with the kind of in-depth interviews or field note and journal writing or diary of authors or participants as in the case of second Kim. The third implication is a caution for the researchers that participants may not be honest as we see the false testimony of first Kim, even in the public session of US Congress. In any case, this kind of research dealings on the inside of deep political circles could be seen very typical of the qualitative research. How do you see your research finding possibly expands into other state? Do you see the various US states normally not so dissimilar in terms of cultural sharing between the NPOs and governments? Respectfully. Author: Jennifer Williams Date: Wednesday, June 10, 2015 2:05:07 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 2 Main Post Purpose and Problem With an ever increasing demand for services and an ever decreasing budget, government agencies are challenged to find new and innovative ways to improve the effective delivery of services despite financial limitations. Collaborating with non-profit organizations (NPOs) has proven to be an effective way to overcome this challenge; however, such collaboration brings a new set of challenges to consider. Studies show that factors such as constraints posed by financial dependence; comprehensive and often overwhelming reporting requirements; loss of organizational autonomy; and differences in administrative cultures, are typical challenges to collaborations between government agencies and NPOs (Boris, 2010; Gazley, 2010; MacIndoe, 2013). The purpose of this proposed study is to explore the problem of how to integrate the differences in the organizational cultures of government agencies and NPOs in order to sustain effective collaborations. Central Research Question R1: What is the culture sharing pattern between a local social service NPO and a state government agency? Sub-question 1: What are the NPOs perceptions of the DHS? Sub-question 2: What are the DHS perceptions of the NPO? Sub-question 3: What examples can be shared to support those perceptions? Sub-question 4: How does each entity value the culture of the other? Sub-question 5: What examples can be shared of culture valuing? Sub-question 6: How can each agency build upon culture sharing? Rationale The study will primarily focus on the attitudes and experience of the leaders of NPOs in southwest Georgia and whether or not those characteristics influence the effectiveness of their collaborations with the Department of Human Services (DHS) located in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. As such, the questions have been developed to identify perceptions, attitudes and cultural values of leadership in NPOs and DHS. It is anticipated that the results of this study will serve as the foundation for implementation of best practice strategies that lead to better collaboration between the two entities. Creswell (2009) described qualitative research as that which is applied to understand the reasons for the problem or issue. Qualitative research is conducted in the natural setting and requires that the researcher become the actual research instrument by relying upon personal observation and interviewing skills. Unlike quantitative research, qualitative research is inductive and emergent. Qualitative research begins with a central question and moves towards a general conclusion based on observed patterns (Creswell, 2009). The qualitative research design is most appropriate for this study as we are seeking to understand the phenomenon of cultural sharing between a small, rural, non-profit organization and a large, metropolitan government agency. Use of the ethnography research design will allow the researcher to study both the NPO and the DHS in a natural setting where the researcher can rely on personal observation, interviews, and focus groups to gather information (Creswell, 2009). This research design is most effective when employed over a length of time so as to allow for the establishment of a positive rapport between the researcher and participants. Such a relationship is beneficial as it allows the researcher access to authentic feedback from participants. Furthermore, this type of design most often results in conclusions that are rich, comprehensive, and written in the voice of the participants. References Boris, E. T. (2010).

Annette, I have enjoyed reading your post. The research problem seems very urgent and demanded to prevent repeat crimes and to improve constructive familial relationship. As the plan employs the elements of race, class and gender, the qualitative research seems adequate than other methods. As said earlier, the scaled purview of investigation would be meaningless or less penetrates the essence of internal and external factors. In your mention, the purpose has been triggered at the intact cultural group suggesting that an extent of harsh or systemic response needs to be placed to strengthen or improve the strategy of interventions and support system. In a nuance, they might be more properly said discrete or even desperate rather than intact. This is because the researcher himself would be placed central about his predisposition and possible bias. How do you find your process of research operation to be evolutionary and iterative if you might gradually form your knowledge as to see them inherently dangerous or inextricable? This is because the qualitative researchers in this case may harbinger around the use of terms involved with discrete, intact, desperate, disprivileged, dangerous, inextricable or improvable and so on. Given the research topic deals with the classification of group, how would you expect if your research activities will be tougher in actual process of interviewing or intimate exchange over time span? That is because if the unkindness, tediousness or even fierceness may be experienced. Thank you for sharing. Author: Annette Fields Date: Wednesday, June 10, 2015 10:10:39 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 2 Research Problem, Purpose and Questions for a Qualitative Research Plan Research Problem The impact of incarceration of family members and children of ex-offenders who tend to recidivate has far reaching consequences on not only family members and their children, but on the ex-offender as well. There is no doubt that strong family ties, commitment, and stability are integral parts of an ex-offender's rehabilitation process once released from jail, but without the proper support systems, the ex-offender is bound to recidivate and return to prison. However, there is serious concern about whether exoffenders can develop and maintain stable lives once exiting prison and form meaningful relationships with family members. Little research has been conducted in this area; however, this research plan will serve to offer some interventions that will improve and strengthen relationships between ex-offenders and family members that could aid in lowering the rate of recidivism and produce more productive citizens in the community. \"Unintended consequences that have led to ex-offenders recidivating so far include: the social disorganization of communities (Clear et al., 2001); reduced job opportunities for ex-prisoners (Holzer et al 2004); diversion of funds away from schools and universities (Hagan and Dinovitzer 1999); and psychological and financial burdens on families\" (Murray, 2005, p. 442). However, before effective interventions can be designed, we must first understand what factors are causing ex-offenders to re-commit crime forcing them to return to prison once released. Until we know and understand these issues, the impact of incarceration on family members and ex-offenders will continue to devastate families and destroy the moral fiber of our country. Having this knowledge will allow researchers and practitioners to offer interventions that will provide the necessary support needed to slowly began to eradicate society of this danger. Purpose Statement The purpose of this research is determine what internal and external factors contribute to the recidivism of ex-offenders and to determine which methods of interventions would be most effective in minimizing those factors in an effort to lower the rate of recidivism. Research Questions Central Question: What are the internal and external factors that contribute to recidivism? Subquestions: 1. What interventions do you believe are most effective in minimizing the impact of internal and external factors? 2. How were your family members, especially your children, impacted by your incarceration? 3. What was the impact of incarceration and separation from family members and children on you personally as an ex-offender? 4. Did the prison system teach you job skills or offer opportunities for you to gain knowledge of jobs while incarcerated? 5. Did you have access to educational training/opportunities inside and outside of prison? 6. Would you be able to maintain a healthy living environment if you had access to job opportunities? Defenses According to Creswell (2013), the rationale for beginning a study (the research problem) is an important part of a study and should be clear and understandable, thus making it simple for the target audience/reader to follow the study. Begin with an opening phrase that grabs the reader's attention, followed by why the researcher feels a need for the study, a summary of current literature on the topic, deficiencies in the literature, and what the audiences and stakeholders stand to gain from the research. Deficiencies in this research topic involve inadequate research. Creswell (2013), states \"the purpose statement provides the major objective or intent, or 'road map,' to the study\" (p. 134). In other words, the purpose statement provides the rationale for why a study is needed. The theoretical framework that will be utilized for this research is \"ethnography which is a \"method of inquiry in which the researcher studies an intact cultural group (ex-offenders and recidivists) in a natural setting (environmental settings and prison) over a prolonged period of time (two years) while collecting data through interviews, questionnaires and observation\" in an effort to understand why ex-offenders recidivate and to learn this information from the ex-offenders' perspective (Creswell, 2009, p. 13). The theoretical lens that will be used in this research study is a critical theory perspective which is \"concerned with empowering human beings to transcend the constraints (external and internal factors) placed on them by race, class (ex-offenders), and gender\" (Creswell, 2009, p. 62). Further, Creswell (2013), states \"research questions are open-ended, evolving and nondirectional\" (p. 138). The central question listed above is encoded to accomplish a narrative/descriptive point of view (ethnographic) in which the study will discuss the exoffenders' stories and experiences gathered during interviews. Also, the subquestions will be utilized on questionnaires as a second method of data collection. References Clear, T. R., Rose, D. R., & Ryder, J. A. (2001).

Mark Murray RE: Discussion Week 3 RSCH-8300P Discussion Post Week 3: Application of Qualitative Research Approaches Mark Murray Walden University Qualitative Research Approach: My qualitative research subject area deals with national sovereignty. For almost 20 years now, globalization has been blamed for reducing the concept of sovereignty due to the growing interdependence between nations (Agnew 2012). However, I believe that poor policy making-not globalization-is responsible for the decline in sovereignty among nations. For example, Ukrainian defense policy reduced spending and generated revenues by reducing Ukraine's military and leasing military facilities in Crimea to Russia (BBC 2014). Decades later when Russia did not like a western-shift in the Ukraine government policies, they used their influence in Crimea and their military power to annex the entire peninsula. Ukraine yielded influence to Russia and the result of this policy was a loss of sovereignty (BBC 2014). In a similar way all nations yield influence everyday-whether it be treaties, trade agreements or transferring government functions to NGOs. When the number of groups holding influence over a nation rises, the ability of that nation to defend its sovereignty is reduced (Murray 2014). To explore this subject I will use a constructivist grounded theory research study to develop my theory of limited sovereignty which asserts that as the number of influence groups able to affect sovereignty increases, the sovereignty of that nation is reduced or limited (Creswell 2013). This study will attempt to identify principle negative influence groups and determine their role in limiting a state's right of self-determination (Ip 2010). Discovering negative influence groups and determining their ability to affect national selfdetermination can help create a predictive model for nations to assess the vulnerability of their national sovereignty (Murray 2014). Research Questions: • What definition of national sovereignty will be used and how is sovereignty limited by influence groups? • What are the characteristics of a negative influence group? • What typology will be used to identify negative influence groups and their ability to impact sovereignty? • What is the definition of a nation's right to self-determination? • What are the implications for limiting a nation's ability to exercise national selfdetermination? Defense of Approach Choice: The use of a constructivist grounded theory approach is most appropriate as a theory is currently not available to explain how poor national policy, rather than globalization, is responsible for the loss of national sovereignty (Nachmias & Nachmias 2008). In this example, my theory of limited sovereignty is needed to \"Explain how people are experiencing a phenomenon\" (Creswell 2013, pp. 88). This approach also stablishes the steps in the process, how that process unfolded and what influences caused the phenomenon (Creswell 2009). A second approach that could also be used would be a case study where I used one or several different cases to develop my theory of limited sovereignty (Creswell 2013). References Agnew, J. (2012).

That likely comes with our focus between the quantitative and qualitative methods. If the globalization thesis concerns of general description of whole populace, your national policy thesis is the kind of story and context as Patten illustrates. The limited sovereignty would be useful to understand the interest of many disciplines, for example, international law in terms of new perspective through the modern history. The sovereignty concept has long been a pillar of concept to lay the foundations of that law, which gradually turns to be reshaped with a more emphasis on the limited sovereignty, for example, Roussea or Schwarzenberger. Notoriously, the scholars began recognizing the obligations erga omnes in the teaching of Bluntschli. Your studies can influence much in the context of interdisciplinary studies. Practically, however, the people may possibly be reluctant to express honestly the status of their national sovereignty. For example, I may like to believe if Korean government is a whole of sovereign state. If you employ a quantitative method, this bias would less likely be removed. How do you plan to achieve a more reliable response? Respectfully. Kiyoung; Great question and a very well written response. Fortunately my research can be conducted independent of the input of policy makers. I recognize that bias will be prevalent in the inputs by policy makers and other government officials. However, the creation of policy and the presence of some negaitve influence groups is available from a variety of sources. -Marl Philip E. Research Questions: Main Research question What strategies can reduce street homelessness and temporary homelessness in New York City? Sub-questions: What improvising methods and use of resources can lead to a strategic change in the process of provision of services to the NYC homeless population? And how can this affect the lives of the mentally ill and chemical addicted homeless individuals in NYC? New York City has marked as the greatest city in the US with the largest number of homelessness in its streets and the shelters within its 5 boroughs. The Department of the Homeless Services operates with the mission of \"preventing homelessness when possible and to provide short-term, emergency shelter for individuals and families\" (DHS, 2015, para. 1). The homeless single adult mentally ill and chemical addicted in NYC homeless shelters and streets are faced with inappropriate and poor quality of services that goes contrary to the mission statement of the Department. Homeless single adults are faced with insufficient housing in the NYC communities and less supportive housing, poor treatment services and few supportive services that can enable them sustain in this economic hardship. Back to work assistance that would re-invigorate and re-establish hope in the minds of these single adults has vanished without strategic solution. New York City and State governments has little progressive policies that institute hope for brighter future for the stigmatized homeless people. The researcher has developed research questions that can best address the problems and study the problem through involving homeless individuals as participants of the research through a grounded theory design of qualitative approach. The qualitative research design suitable for this study will be the grounded theory research that will require the researcher to explore common experiences of participating individuals to develop a theory towards the research study. \"Grounded research theory design is systemic, with qualitative procedures that researchers employ to generate an overall explanation through the views of the participants in the research approach\" (Creswell, 2012, p. 21). Grounded theory design studies a number of individuals who have experienced the action, interaction or process of the theory of homelessness and will enable researcher gather data and be able to interpreted data, one-on-one interview without bias. The study of homeless phenomena is systemic and researcher involving participants that have lived the experience will also ensure an explanation that is grounded in data, and enables researcher to construct predictive conclusions and explanations about experiences of the research participants. References: Creswell, J., W. (2012). Educational research: planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (4th ed.). Boston, MA: Pearson Education Hi. Philip, I have enjoyed reading your post. I personally respect the hard work on the grounded theory researcher because it is not only creative, but also powerful to provide the general explanations. It is also because our usual practice of law department is merely a half of the process. The law professors and court judges would be a theory generator on his own right, but their research process is to heavily -most always entirely--draw upon the examination of prior research or case laws. In this case, the authors of prior research or judges of precedents might likely be the participants within the grounded theory researcher. Nevertheless, the field work or engagement on the kind of observations and in-depth interviews normally are not present-at least, in terms of tangible interaction. How do you duly circumscribe your scope of investigation not only for cost-effective research, but also for the validity and reliability of your research? Respectfully. Philip Elekwachi Kim, Thank you for your interest and zeal to reading my work. In qualitative research, qualitative inquirer to reach or make validated and reliable report of their outcome must employ validation procedures such as member checking, triangulation, and the data sources must provide evidence of the accuracy of the information in the qualitative report. According to Creswell (2012) qualitative researchers must \"use at least two validation strategies when conducting qualitative research which involves member checking and triangulation\" (p. 262). During the research, it will be important to apply constant comparative coding, triangulate data between information and ensuing categories in the research process. Develop theory from data through posing questions that the categories, look for evidence, incidents, and events that relate to the grounded study theory of research. In grounded theory research, validation is an important part of the research process (Creswell, 2007).The researcher must in an effort to ensure validating and reliability utilize variety of tools, such as questionnaires or interviews by, observing participants behavior, monitoring data similarity and providing informed consent from participants and ensuring ethical standard.

Eric Wright Research Question: Is there a correlation between first-line supervisor characteristics and follower engagement within the government sector? Researchers have the obligation to convey their participant's story through personal interactions, observations, reports, and reflective journals. However significant the study, the research is only as good as the ability of the investigator to describe the phenomenon to the audience. Therefore, a researcher should have a systematic and logical approach to a qualitative study. Research methods for qualitative inquires may be broken into five different categories: narrative research, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, and case study (Creswell, 2013). The strategy or structure will affect the validity and reliability of the study; therefore, the researcher must expound on not only the findings but also be descriptive and articulate throughout the research. Because my interests are in employee engagement within the government sector, my two choices for qualitative research are case study and ethnography. The central question would be to determine if there are characteristics of firstline supervisors that directly affect employee engagement. Case studies focus on a specific problem and provide great detail into organizations, people, and events. Furthermore, the researcher assigns specific objectives or goals for the case study to determine (Stacks, 2005). Government agencies are historically bureaucratic with rigid quasi-military ranking structure. In this organizational style, change happens from top-down and rarely from bottom-up. This becomes a challenge, in that, bottom-line employees do not feel they are contributing to change because of their perceived place at the bottom and lack of upper influence. This becomes the importance of the first-line supervisor as the bridge that connects upper executives to the needs of their followers. Therefore, the focus will not be just focused on the government sectors, but also on the relationships between first-line supervisors, their subordinates, and their immediate supervisors. As Putney (2010) believes, case studies allow researchers to choose a precise group and establishes specific conditions for the study. Understanding the didactic relationships between first-line supervisors and keeping employees engaged is key for organizational success. Ethnography has the purpose to explore cultures and provide an expressive interpretation of beliefs (Caines, 2010). One of the strengths of ethnography is allowing the researcher the ability to study the participants in their natural environment and to listen directly to the emotions and beliefs of each participant (Murray, 2008). For my study, ethnography will focus on behavioral patterns within the organizational structure. Specifically, the behaviors of first-line supervisors will be evaluated through common leadership principles such as setting the right example, sharing vision or inspiring, admitting mistakes, creating a positive environment and other positive leadership behaviors. Observing the interactions first-hand between supervisors and their followers should provide insight and reasons for successful and ineffective styles of management. References Caines, K. (2010).

Hi. Eric, Thank you for the good post. The article discussed last time seems similar in terms of subject matter within yours. It was intended to build up a theory which we classed as the grounded theory research. Given your approach were to be case studies or ethnography, what do you expect their essences or shared pattern of behaviors or what are you fundamentally concerned to raise a voice of specific group? This question is because the relationship is direct and instant so that can be very provocative and sensitive. I also like to know what you see any difference between the private firms, public organization, and governmental entities in your concern. Will your research plan include any insight on this question? Respectfully. Kiyoung, Thanks for your input. My research will focus on the government sector; however, I think its important to understand the differences between private, public and government entities. In particular public and government agencies differ from private as their purpose is to provide public services to its stakeholders. While, private may have the goals of profit and expansion. The specific group I will focus on is the middle management, such as first-line supervisors that fall beneath executive management. I choose this group because of the influence they have on the organization. The executive leadership may create the mission, but it will only be accomplished with the support of middle management and their ability to influence bottom-line employees to attain objectives. In regards to their patterns, I would expect that certain characteristics will be consistent with supervisors that are able to connect with their followers and achieve employee engagement. I would like to identify or explore the causes of these characteristics such as higher education, years of experience, training developmental classes, or factors that may be controlled by the participants. Thanks again for your questions and thoughts. V/r, Eric [Week 4] Hi. Genea Thank you for the excellent post. Your points are well articulated (i) the qualitative research has a strength in use of theories other than quantitative one (ii) a reflexively dialogic approach in researching new theories and scientific knowledge could be developed (iii) the utility of both frameworks, say, theoretical and conceptual. Given the diverse lens of qualitative research circles – if normally on objective stance in quantitative studies, Gergen's argument seems safe the quantitative studies are prone to be theory-blind and neutral of theories. As the quantitative studies purports for description of general population, the aspect seems more reinforced. For the article's subject matters, the qualitative needs are more appropriate that the clients of psychotherapeutic treatment are the kind of indigenous group or even patient less friendly with normal humanity. How do you consider if the conceptual framework other than theoretical one is satisfactorily exercised in this article? Do you see if the author has dealt successfully with a dialogic approach in researching new theories and scientific knowledge? Respectfully. Author: Genea Shoulders Date: Tuesday, June 23, 2015 5:02:23 PM EDT Subject: Discussion Main Post What is a theoretical framework? Statistic Solution (2015) identified a theoretical framework as a conceptual idea in which a sense of structure that guides the research is established (para.1). This form of framework provides developers with background information for the purpose and justification for why the study needs to be conducted. On the other hand, conceptual framework explains through graphical or narrative writings the primary points that will be studied as well as key concepts and variables. The primary concern for a conceptual framework is to examine a situation that already exist in society and why more research needs to done. Patton (2015) then suggested that the combination of theory-based research and qualitative method of analysis will yield greater results than using the quantitative approach (p.97). In order to determine whether a study is based on theoretical or conceptual framework all depends on the research question. For example, the article in question is based on the psychological discipline in which they are seeking to determine \"why individuals think and feel a certain way.\" Clarkson (1996) central question focused on determining and experimenting how the qualitative approach alters the understanding and effectiveness of clinical practice (para.9). Patton (2015) then argued that the distinction between what paradigmatic, strategic, and theoretical framework within any research is both arguable and unplanned (p.97). With this in mind the article for this discussion is based on a conceptual framework. Gergen and Gergen (1991) argued the idea that through a reflexively dialogic approach in research new theories and scientific knowledge could be developed (p.86). In addition to Gergen and Gergen, Norcross and Goldfried (1992) that quantitative research has been unable to prove that one theoretical framework works better than the other. With this in mind, the article in questions seeks to develop a theory based on a conceptual framework in which developers seeks through a narrative analysis. Narrative analysis included writings within the psychological relationship, therapeutic relationship as well as relationships with others. The authors seek to take an open stance towards the research with the hopes elaborating on the nature of the problem as the study progresses. This type of framework is approach because it will allow research to work from the bottom up rather than starting at the top and working down. Also, the conceptual framework will allow developers to work with a general view of theories rather than sticking with one specific theory associated with the nature of the study.

Jennifer I have enjoyed reading your post. Your mention of the continuum of inquiry and explanation between theoretical and conceptual are very enlightening if we explore the structure of thesis or article. The continuum of inquiry is often strongly demanded of research piece, and considered very important quality so as to happily interact with the referees of article and knowledge audience. As we come with both frameworks, the theoretical may exercise likely a commander of chief in battle field and conceptual may play like a chief of platoon. The consistence and integrity would not be so easy when the researchers have to tumble with the massive data and difficult challenges through his research process. Since the topic of article is sophisticated and perplexing in some aspects, we can suggest the clear position on the use of theoretical framework rather than a wider citation of theories could allow much more persuasion. Why do you think the researcher employed a conceptual framework than theoretical one although he is supposed to be well exposed to general phenomenon with long years of clinical practice -as Knight hinted on the trait of theoretical framework? Respectfully. Kiyoung. Author: Jennifer Williams Date: Thursday, June 25, 2015 11:17:11 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 4 Main Post The purpose of this week's assignment was to analyze the article by Clarkson (1996) and to determine the theoretical or conceptual framework of the research followed by a discussion on the appropriateness of the identified framework. Knight (Laureate, 2010) made mention of the \"continuum of inquiry\". She explained that the framework of a study is theoretical if much is known about the phenomenon as opposed to being conceptual where little is known. This explanation stuck with me as I began to read the assigned article. As Clarkson (1996) stated in his introduction, there is a large body of theory regarding \"the essentials of psychological functioning\" (p. 143). This language led me to believe that the research would be conducted in a theoretical framework until I realized that although the author is claiming that much has been theorized about the general phenomenon, he is not actually referencing any theory in particular. In fact, because he does not clearly state any one theoretical base from which to build his research, it becomes clear that this study has been conducted from a conceptual framework. The author's use of a conceptual framework became crystal clear as I continued to read. As noted by Knight (Laureate, 2010) and Creswell (2009), the use of theory in qualitative research may not lay the foundation for the research but theory does in fact guide the research. In the case of Clarkson (1996), the use of theory was an inductive process where the theory became the end point and was grounded in \"five major categories of discourse about the therapeutic relationship\" (p. 162) that emerged from several methods of data collection including: researcher observation and experience; review of records; and, the experience of others. Regarding the appropriateness of the selected framework for this particular study, I believe that either theoretical or conceptual framework would have been appropriate. I make this determination based on the fact that the author was clear that much theory exists about the general phenomenon of psychological functioning. With that in mind, the author could have conducted the study with a theoretical framework by identifying one of the several theories on the subject and then building upon that theory to explore the gap in research regarding specifically, the role of therapeutic relationships in psychological functioning. Instead, the author chose to utilize a conceptual framework that involved researching broad themes about the impact of therapeutic relationships in psychological functioning and identifying patterns, themes or categories that emerge from the data. In my opinion, either way would have been appropriate. References Clarkson, P. (1996).

Doctoral research: Use and role of theory in research. Baltimore: Author. Hi. Eric, I have enjoyed reading your post. As the scope of investigation is wide and interdisciplinary, the theoretical framework may less readily come to be spawned in the mind of researcher in this case. The qualitative nature of knowledge generation may, instead, complement with this grey and less picturesque deals with his research problem or goals. His belief on strengths of the qualitative inquiry over his long career experience seems very firm and supportive through the discussion, conclusion, and recommendation. The concept seemingly created from such belief later establishes like a lynchpin through his five main theoretical frameworks. How do you find if the data source were to be rather simplified to focus on texts and documentation excluding the observations and experience? Respectfully. Author: Eric Light Date: Wednesday, June 24, 2015 10:16:11 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 4 Framework provides guidelines and structure for the researcher in their attempt to explain or explore phenomenon. In qualitative research, the researcher must choose an approach from a theoretical framework or a conceptual framework to determine a course of action (Laureate Education, 2010). Many times, the research problem will drive the researcher to the most appropriate outline for their study. On the one hand, if the researcher is unfamiliar with a phenomenon or no current theory exists, they may choose a conceptual approach. In this case, the researcher might begin with thoughts or concepts that describe their views of the problem. On the other hand, if theory exists and in-depth investigations and literature review have been complied on the subject matter, then the researcher should use theoretical framework. Many times new phenomenon start as a conceptual framework and with abundant exploration becomes a theoretical approach. At the beginning of a research paper, the researcher may use a conceptual framework to describe their methodology of the study. Clarkson (1996) begins the paper with a conceptual framework that points out that past research has shown that no one theory is appropriate for psychological functioning. Clarkson (1996) specifically mentions the benefit of conceptual framework is taking research from differing fields such as psychoanalysis/psychotherapy, psychology, and counseling. Clarkson (1996) clearly expresses the personal involvement and lack of objectivity as stated, \"instead of an objective experimenter on an object, I would engage from the subjective realities of my ongoing existential situation\" (para. 19). Irby, Brown & Yang (2006) believe conceptual framework the individual has personal interaction with the environment and makes personal developments from the experience. As Clarkson discusses sampling, theoretical framework is identified as a means for discovering therapeutic relationships of differing disciplines. Finally, Clarkson clearly states that 58 specifically referenced sources with over 1,000 texts were used to for the pilot study. In-depth investigations of past literature show that more rigorous methods of scientific analysis may produce better theoretical concepts (Young & López, 2005). This in-depth investigation of past literature shows the need for a theoretical framework. In the beginning, Clarkson opened with a conceptual framework to explain the research paradigm and show the need for more consideration into psychotherapy. However, Clarkson later makes connections between research and the literature which is established in a theoretical framework. Clarkson used both frameworks to first convey his thoughts on past literature and then transitioned into making connections within the phenomenon. Clarkson, P. (1996).

In comparison of other data source, I agree that observation can be more accurate or complete since the humans often are tamed to answer in ways what is socially desirable. They are learned and inculcated which would structure their personality for socially desirable or statistically probable. The kind of liking on his personality, say, the good livelihood and conscience-looking or reasonable and intelligenceflavor person seem mostly of cases in our neighborhood. One teacher of statistics, in my example, with the tip of Murphy's rule may point to both of the limitations of statistics, but goodness of the probability-based scientific lives. Nevertheless, the kinds of Murphy seem not absent in our society, e.g., seriously depraved students from school bullying and innate fear of MERS-Cov, or family members of gun-shooting victims. The probability or scientific lives might be less effective on their sense, knowledge and recognition that the quantitative concept only may heal. Hence we may advise the patient-students in the clinic to expand your horizon of sight for the big world and neighbors. Their sight may be divisible in three types of humans or universe among \"great, marginal and ordinary person\" as Creswell guides, ironically a qualitative teacher in this class. Nevertheless, three types also could be matched up with the bell type assumption used at the beginning point of statistics, say, two marginalities and vast mid population, which implies the convergence of two methods. In other words, the qualitative and quantitative concepts may share a trait. Then the issue seems to lie in the honesty of participants as you see as limitation of observation. In the aspect of qualitative knowledge, your point seems most challenging that they are structured to answer what is socially desirable than candid or honest response. How do you respond with this tendency of person if you are a qualitative inquirer in the process of in-depth interview? Respectfully. [Week 5] Author: Constance Cuttino Date: Wednesday, July 1, 2015 3:00:18 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 5Main Post CCuttino Advantage and Disadvantages of Observations in Research The strength of observations include directness, flexibility, and permanent record and compliments other research methods. Observations allow opportunities for the researcher to have direct access to the study population (University of Strathclyde, 2015). Through this process the researcher can observe and record behavior and reactions of the study population without having to rely on other sources that do not offer first-hand reporting such as surveys, written interviews or questionnaires that are not recorded in person (University of Strathclyde, 2015). While, interviews and questionnaires are good, they may not be accurate or complete and the person might answer in ways that correspond to what is socially desirable. Observations can be used with most research methods as the approach is flexible, diverse (structured/unstructured), and can be applied to each research method (University of Strathclyde, 2015). Observations provide permanent records of events and/or behavior and enhances the quality of evidence made available to other researchers. Disadvantages of observations include the practicability, observer bias and observer effect. Observations may be time consuming and costly depending upon the resources needed. Observer bias occurs when the researcher does not record what has been observed but records what they wanted to see or what they thought they observed (Laureate Education, 2015). Effect as related to observation occurs when the presence of the observer (researcher) becomes intrusive and influences the behavior of those being observed. Observation exercise The setting-Meeting room: There are at least two tables, one where people are seated and another holding at least one chart (with graphs on it possibly and it located at the far side of the room), while the other chart appears to be located closer to the team meeting. There are several documents on the table of various sizes (I estimate at least four), and at least one in a red folder. The people-There are four people located at the center table, two females and two males. One female is African-American (it appears) with long, black hair and green dress, the other female appears to be Caucasian, blonde wearing a white blouse and dark colored skirt. The two males both have white shirts and ties with dark trousers, (one male has dark hair and another with lighter hair maybe), they all appear to be of various ages, although the Caucasian female appears to be a bit older than the others who look like they are in the mid20's and 30's. The young man with the red folder in front of him appears to be the leader (or at least the one speaking to the other group who appear to be listening attentively). The actionAccording, to Janesick's observation list we should focus on at least one person (pp.62, which for me would be the African-American female because of her bright green dress, she stands out the most for me. She appears to be asking a question or at least responding to something the male leader appears to be discussing something related to the folder in front of him. There always appears that there is some attempt by the older female to also engage in conversation with the male person who appears to be the leader. Janesick's guide to observation helps the researcher to focus not only on the details of their surroundings but also on the population associated with the study. I think that observations are good for research, however I would think within a smaller setting such as the meeting (used for this class discussion) it was much easier to observe as compared to a live setting with lots of people, either way I like the idea of observations in research.

As you commented, observations occasionally surprise us to reflect how I could miss such fact. We may find a cleavage of buildings and phone to the pertinent office of government about the safety regulations. Many men would miss on their bias and predisposition for busy routine days, which is not the business of qualitative researcher. Observation also seems to rapport with the kind of Buddhist ideas or meditative process inside the human mind in terms of utility and strands, which can possibly upgrade the quality of apprehension. Have you ever experienced this oriental attitude and practice or furthered on thought relating to the qualitative research? Respectfully.

The strengths of observation are that they allows the observer to be \"Open and discovery oriented\", have a fresh perspective toward the location or subject and it gives the observer the chance to learn things people may be unwilling to discuss. Observers who are prepared to observe are likely to discover things unnoticed before-things that are so common they escape daily notice –such as the level of decay of a building. In addition, an observer in a completely new setting is able to take a lot of data in because everything is so new, nothing has become easy to ignore or overlook. Finally, observation provides insight into people and their behaviors that people may not want to discuss. One example from the Patton text (2015) is the romantic encounters during the wilderness leadership program (Patton 2015). Weaknesses include distortion caused by our biases, perceptions, world view and culture (Creswell 2009). The impact from our perceptions shades our interpretation of events and ultimately causes our data to drift from accuracy. Observation Write-Up: Setting: The room appears to be some type of meeting room or classroom. There is a sectioned off thee-segment desk they ae sitting at. There are seven objects on the table, two books with one that looks like a pocket reference book. It is green. The other book has a red title banner at the top, but no other info is available. There is an eye glass case-likely for the white male's glasses. There is an orange folder with papers and the white woman has a blue folder that is open. The black woman has a few sheets of paper in front of her and some type of book. The chairs in the room are black and do not appear to be attached to the table. They are of a modern design with aluminum. There are three other white segmented desks behind these people and a metal easel with some data written on int. There is also a stainless steel sink and long counter in the background. My impressions are a school, lab or hospital. People & Action: There are four people in the picture. One white male, one male of indeterminate race, a black female and a white female; all of them are looking at the white male I notice the white male is older, in his 40s and has store-bought magnifying glasses. He has a common watch on his left wrist and a pen in his other hand. He is wearing jeans, a black top with a white t-shirt underneath. He has shorter hair. The other male also has a watch, which appears nicer that the white mans. He is dressed better, appears younger with a more stylish haircut. The black woman is dressed casually and has long hair. She is looking at the white male. She has is wearing business casual and has her arms crossed. She appears to be wearing khaki pants. She has a look that is negative on her face. The white woman appears to be a bit older, is showing some cleavage and has a watch and bracelet on. She appears to have a ring or two on as well as a necklace. It appears that this man has an orange folder that is upside down and he is using it to discuss something. The folder is pointed at the other male and the white man is using his pen to point at something on the page while talking. He is looking the other guy right in the eyes. References Creswell, J.

It shows a classroom-like location with two identifiable rows of desks and chairs. There is a sink against one wall, suggesting either a multipurpose or special use classroom. Four of the desks are placed together to support four participants in a meeting. Equipment: Three of the participants have note-talking material. There is a handwritten list in front of one participant. Two books are (face down) on the table in front of the older male, one book book is face down in front of the younger female. There is an easel behind the two females. Written on it is schedule of times and several names including Sarah, Doyle, and (Possibly) Rebecca. There are two breaks listed on the schedule written on the board that suggests the activity is one day's schedule. Personnel: Two males and two females are in discussions. The oldest person is male and the focus of the other three's attention. The oldest male holds a pen in his right hand and appears to be making a point to the other three. The youngest participant is male and sits opposite the oldest. Two females sit to the right of the speaker. The older one is married and holding a pen. The other female participant rests on her arms together on the table. Both females have pensive or concerned expressions as they focus their attention on the speaker. The speaker is making eye contact with the younger male at the moment when the picture was taken. Commentary: The facts of the meeting are not known. Whether known or not, as Dr. Knight-Lynn has noted (Laureate Education, 2010), it is important to ensure observer bias is not reflected in the observations or the evaluation of the research. The factors displayed in this picture comport with those seen in academic meetings. This is based upon the items listed in the environment, equipment and personnel sections above. The clothing worn is suitable for an academic environment. The presence of books, including one in the shape typical of a small dictionary or foreign language dictionary, also support that scenario. Finally, the schedule depicted on the white board, and the list of single terms or words in front of the older male adds to the possibility that this is an academic meeting. A more subjective aspect is to examine the body language of the participants. There is a restraint and relative passivity in the group's body language is compatible with an academic environment but is less frequently observed in diplomatic, field construction, military, or government management situation. The type of observation done in this exercise is as a complete observer. Thank you for reading! Have a great week ;-) Mark References Creswell, J. W. (2013).

I apologize for misreading, but I can see that I needed to shift focus on this post --at least to include comments on the advantages or disadvantages of the method used. In this case, as noted above, I used the complete observer method for a five-minute review of photo number four. Advantages: 1. As a complete observer I did not (could not!) influence the situation. 2. As a complete observer, I was not influenced by any personal contacts with the units of analysis –the people in the picture. 3. Viewing a picture, I could gain a strong understanding of the physical situation from at least one relevant angle. I could identify at least one portion of the items that defined –or shaped, the environment and the activity. Disadvantages: This photo, presented in this sterile environment is devoid of definitive context that participation or close observation could provide. (This is not to say all photos are necesarrily that way –there are some photos that need zero words and little context to deliver clear and moving signals). 1. The mission, issues and personalities are masked from those who only see the picture. (A picture is worth a 1000 words, but may not sufficient, without additional background. 2. Analysis of this (or most) photo(s) must be accompanied by relevant background or context material –or they are subject to bias and misinterpretation by researchers. Thank you for reading! Mark Hi. Mark, I have enjoyed reading your post. Your distinction from the complete and participant observations seem very practical and relevant to respond strategically with the respective research process. I consider if the choice of two ways could lead to a different description of sites or individuals observed. What strengths do you see between two ways? What situation would compel the researcher to conduct as the participant observer than complete observer? Respectfully. [Week 6] Hi. Constance, I have enjoyed reading your post. Your elements revealed within the observation of class video seem adequately deal with the important aspect of your focus, and especially the broke-up with the words from the student and teacher into what the reality is consequential to develop your focus. The Gestalt effect also preaches this kind of developmental conception of mind in which the capability of our brain to generate whole forms beyond the points, lines and curves, perhaps just collections of simpler and related elements. The cognitive processes of human agent differ between the behaviorist and structuralist in which he or she seeks to understand the organization among the elements. As Kaffka principled, \"The whole is other than the sum of parts,\" or \"The whole is greater than the sum of parts.\" It thrusts as reflexive of qualitative studies through the process, i.e., research questions, the data collection or sampling, coding and analysis to deal with the parts, which eventually might come into the whole, human or universe as Patton guides. Respectfully. Author: Constance Cuttino Date: Wednesday, July 8, 2015 5:05:59 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 6 Main Post Connie Cuttino Observation of Classroom Video Last week's assignment had us observe a picture of a meeting between four people in what appeared to in a conference or meeting area, this week's assignment afforded us the opportunity to observe a video clip of children and their teacher interacting in class. The observation of the video gave us the opportunity to view study participants without having to guess their emotions, gauge interaction amongst their peers and gather some true responses without having to guess. Of the many aspects the video presents, I chose to focus on the interaction between the teacher and the students specially, how effective her instruction technique was and student engagement; having come from an after-school provider background, this was my interest. The first thing that caught my attention was the bulletin board labeled \"Mountain Math\", this peeked my curiosity as we are not immediately sure of the terms association and the classroom math activity presented. There is a diverse population of students within the classroom including the teacher and overall it is a typical classroom setting with desk, chairs, bulletin boards etc. There was a lot of excitement in the classroom as the teacher proceeded to teach the children how to count and write dollars and cents. The teacher used some math manipulatives i.e. coin shaped, laminated paper with various coin amounts. The teacher had the three students up front to place the coin papers in their hands in order to form what she called the \"Mickey Mouse\" shape (this was an innovative teaching technique so that the students would not get bored and stay engaged). The children were very enthusiastic and focused; one young man in an orange shirt seated in the front row spoke out of turn at times and had to quieten by the teacher in order to maintain classroom control. Speaking of classroom control, the teacher did an awesome job of controlling the classroom so that all were able to learn the lesson being taught. As the lesson progresses, the teacher calls on two students to write two versions of the coin amount and the young man who writes $.53, upon which he is properly thanked by the teacher for \"playing the game.\" The term \"game\" used instead of \"math\" further suggest that the teacher is making efforts to promote a \"fun while learning\" environment which is one of the best approaches for a young child to lean and retain the information. Overall, the children seem to have learned the lesson being taught, including interjecting their own observations, such as the student in the back who says that the $ sign represents a larger amount of money as compared to a cents sign. Finally, at the end of the video, the teacher instructs the students to put away their \"Mountain Math\" materials (connection to bulletin board), and they proceed to put their instructional information in some boxes that appear to be decorated, I assume by the student so that they may be able to readily identify their information. Again, what is most noticeable is the excitement in the classroom as students vie for a chance to answer the math questions and the simple, yet innovative instructional methods the teacher exudes to ensure the desired results are captured i.e. students learning and retaining, the \"Mountain Math\" project for the day. Techniques and Considerations The techniques used last week while observing the photo ask us to observe everything and then report what we assumed was true i.e. the setting and the description of the people and then interpret what we thought was happening in the photograph. In review of the video, we were asked to ask to create a research question or focused on at least one aspect of the video, which to me reduced the level of inaccuracy. Although the observation process for the photo and video allows the observer sit still and record as accurately as possible what is going on, video camera will allow the researcher to watch and analyze what has been recorded at a later time and can be reviewed over and over again for accuracy;. While it is possible to review a photo over and over again, I am not sure that I could gauge the same information as compared to the video. The video also allows the researcher to focus on one or more categories on what the observers intends the data to be used for, in my case the focus was on the teaching method, level of engagement and even the level of retention from some of the students; this could not be done with a photo. Overall, the video was much more engaging, offering some instant data without much guess work and allowed me to interpret what was being presented as compared to the photo from last week.

From these last two weeks, whre we considered directed and open observation, I tend to deduct that there is an issue of finding the appropriate tradeoff between quantity and quality which is an important factor the observer/inquirer should consider. As Creswell (2013) explained, this would depend on the approach, but also the purpose and the delimited research questions. I think that the distinction between trivial and detail is relative and would depend on the what the observer is looking for givien the research questions or the approach. Some aspects covered in a narrative research (for instance autoethnography) may become superflux in a case study or ethnography for instance. Hi. Rodolphe, Thank you for reading my post. I may hit to come with your cute first name. These days I came across the German psychologists, who developed the basis of rationalism psychology in the 19 centuries. One psychologist, W. Wundt, who is a founder of structuralism, alleged the heterogony of ends where the goal-directed activities often cause the experiences that modify the original motivational pattern. His science on structuralism had been interacted with the behaviorism, for example, Levin, but its salience had waned from a lack of adequate translations or the behaviorism's polemic with the structuralist program. His work on the optical illusion also is useful to reflect the topic of this week, and his views that the highest intelligence is a logical product of more primitive manifestations seems echoing of the importance of observation although he accepted a developmental conception of mind. His contribution likely is thought as powerful to guide our class (i) He turned a focus on the human himself, and deeply attracted from the human elements, which is a central stance for the qualitative inquiries (ii) he suggests the context and characteristic of goal directed activities or intentional strand of human in his heterogony of ends thesis, which relates with the focused observation or qualitative studies in general (iii) especially his rule of optical illusion and argument on the importance of more primitive manifestations in consciousness and rationalization within the mind seem theoretically entwined with our class purpose on understanding the qualitative inquiries. Respectfully. Author: Jennifer Williams Date: Wednesday, July 8, 2015 2:31:57 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 6 Main Post The Observation In preparation for a directed observation, the researcher's first order of business is to develop a research statement or question that is to be the focus of the observation. This week, I have decided to observe the assigned video with a focus on the quality of teacher and student interaction. I've selected this as my focus because having worked in the field of education for 23 years, this subject is one about which I am passionate. Viewing the Teachers and Students Observation video (Laureate, 2012d), was informative and allowed me to draw the conclusion that this particular teacher and her students have a high degree of positive interaction that is refreshing and much needed in today's classroom. Throughout the observation, I noted that the teacher was fully engaged with her students. She knew each by name, called on a variety of children, delivered an interactive lesson, and had created a stimulating yet safe classroom environment where children felt free to answer questions or give opinions without fear of shame. The teacher's use of student helpers was also an indication of high quality interaction. The children were happy to participate and knew exactly what to do which led me to believe that this behavior and level of interaction was the classroom norm rather than a show being put on for the visitors. Also indicative of high quality interaction was the teacher's complete control of her class. Her patient yet firm response to children speaking when they should not have been was effective in bringing order to her class without skipping a beat. Prior to the children leaving for lunch, the teacher gave clear direction regarding the weather and she let the children know what to expect after lunch. This was an excellent strategy for maintaining classroom control as unanticipated disruptions to daily activities often cause anxiety in children. Finally, the multi modal approach to teaching the lesson that included props, individual recording of answers, recording of answers on the block paper in front of the class, and using critical thinking skills, kept the students engaged and focused on the lesson. Observations: Directed or Open In comparing last week's open observation to this week's directed observation, I have learned that while there are benefits to both, I prefer the latter. I find it much easier to observe with a focus and to gather data related to that focus rather than to simply observe for the sake of trying to capture everything. Although I understand that any qualitative observation requires flexibility, I like the focus of the directed observation as it keeps me alert and concentrating on elements that are relative to my research question or statement. I also find the narrative piece of the directed observation to be of a different tone than the open observation. Where the open observation allowed me to write in a literary style using relaxed, free flowing prose and metaphors, the directed observation compelled me to write in a more logical sequence that began with stating the purpose of my research and then only writing about elements that were related to the purpose. The issues of classroom size, number of students, racial makeup of participants, gender and age seemed unimportant to this observation as my focus was simply to observe elements that were relevant to the interaction between teacher and students.

Since you have decades of career experience as a school teacher, you likely could be a computer brain of observer, which might cause you be tedious over your observation. Atkinson and Shiffrin proposed the three functions of memory, say, sensory, short-term and long term. They particularized the importance of working history memory for the consciousness and behavioral pattern of person. In Korea, the smoking is prohibited within the corridor of apartment complexes the violation of which is reacted with a light penalty. Nevertheless, oftentimes, small number of adults smoke there conventionally, and the warden patrols occasionally. One smoker sometimes encounters his person when smoking, and implicit pardons had been given several times because it is the kind of communal etiquette than serious violation. He later asked the warden about his patrol, and realized that it is his official course of action to prevent a serious crime than smoking, as well as based on the CCTV. It actually was his principle motive for patrol. The consciousness of smoker had been wrong that the warden has a unique goal of preventing a smoking, and different process of internal minds, very feared of his sudden appearance in the dark corridor for the smoker and general purpose of patrol against all the potential crimes or those of more serious nature, had oddly crossed there. This may suggest that the sensory memory needs to be re-tracked if the agent should be scientific about its accuracy, meaning, quality and implications. On the other, the working history memory relatively is more prone to be authentic and rigid. Although the description is less cute in difference, that might be some factor between me and you in observing the class video? Respectfully. Hi. Rodolphe and Genea, Thank you for the good question. Actually I had, at considerable extent, been exposed to the concept and theory based German legal scholarship. As Korea is the country of civil law origin that imported German civil law because of the Japanese influence. They teach what is the concept and theory of \"legal incident\" appreciable as a matter of law before they teach contract, property and torts law. It is principled and applicable comprehensively to the specific area of laws and cases. That would likely be same as we draw a hypothesis from the theory, and test quantitatively for the research findings. This abstract nature of discourse in the beginning to study the civil code seems to illustrate the typology of deductive reasoning. The American case law system is converse that the cases would lately provide the basis for the conclusion, e.g. restatement -or legal theory -from the scholarly work by legal researchers, e.g. the polymorphic principle from Siegel, professor of Yale law school. It is, therefore, the kind of inductive reasoning. The \"unstructured interview\" usually appears in the discourse of qualitative studies, which is used to contrast with the closed questions of quantitative studies, and seems interchangeably usable with the interview of open-ended questions. I intended that the two other approaches could be covered in this definition, meaning a wide use of coverage to denote the whole types of qualitative interview. The \"interview guide questions\" will be covered as if the prearranged and print forms of insurance contract falls within the contract as one of legal incident same with the handwritten contract. The standardized open-ended approach also still falls within the definition as if the labor contract in the European and Korean civil laws is negotiated and concluded with rigid conditions imposed by the government and labor unions. It is a legal incident most comprehensively, and contract or labor contract more specifically as covered within the definition of legal incident. Respectfully. Hi Genea, I consider that the process developer, at least, could reduce the chance of failure or miscarriage of the precious interview meeting. As ten standardized objections argue, the interview should not be predictable, but the kind of fresh and unanticipated information must flow even to surprise the interviewer. Nevertheless, we can hardly deny that the role and leadership of interviewer creates the condition and progress of interview and productivity of data collection as we simply learn with two video demonstrations. The process development including well \"predesigned protocol with some extent of anticipation\" seems practical and effective to deter the data corruption. The \"instance of wisdom and trained skills of interviewer\" also would be critical to deter it. It actually is important to ensure that the data is rich, detailed and accurate. Otherwise the corruption will likely occur. The good performance on this point can be prevented in those two ways. Respectfully.

Patton (2002) defined three approaches of interviews for qualitative inquiry. the first approach is the informal conversational interview. In this interview, the inquirer does not use pre-established questions but adapt to the setting and the interviewee's context, while stayed focued. This approach might better fit the definition you proived. However, there are two other approaches wchich are interview guide and standardized open-ended approaches. The first is based the use of general pre-established questions of whihc order and content are adpated on field. The second is rather rigid and can be used to reduce bias when many interviewers are engaged in the interviews. Do you think that these two appraoches can also be considered \"unstructured\"?

Within the process developers are able to address such issues that you have mentioned in your posting. Could the process truly deter corrupted data due to the researcher? Genea Hi. Eric, I have enjoyed reading your post. You said, \"The interviewer did not sell the study.\" This point is considered important to protect the rights or interests of participants. It likely relates critically with the ethical issues of research and issue of informed consent. The ethics of bioresearch or research based on the on-line space would especially be one source of contention in terms of privacy and public standard. In this case, I suppose it seems more dubious if the researcher could fully inform the participants of their study. What difference can you suggest between the face to face interview and on line based one in terms of research ethics? Respectfully. Author: Eric Light Date: Wednesday, July 15, 2015 8:08:49 PM EDT Subject: RE: DIscussion 1 Week 7 Quantitative and Qualitative inquiries give the researcher a systematic and structured approach to the research problem. Key pieces such as the introduction, the strategies of inquiry, and the methodology of collecting the data all assist in formatting the study logically. Similarly, qualitative researchers should use a systematic process in approaching the interview of each participant. The process should focus on key points that will create rapport and trust between the researcher and the participant. Janesick (2011) recommends the researcher show interest in the interviewee and create an environment that is relaxed. Furthermore, Janesick (2011) suggests to begin with the topic, build a relationship with the participant, ask additional small questions from their responses, and finish the interview with the participant's input (pg. 243). The videos were excellent examples of how a researcher should and should not conduct an interview. The second video strategies followed Janesick's suggestions and was an overall better interview from the atmosphere to the participant's responses. The doctoral research videos Interview Techniques displayed two differing methods between the interviewer and the participant (Laureate Education, 2010c). From the start, the researcher stood and properly greeted the participant versus staying seated and keeping a clustered interview environment. In the second video the desk was smaller and created less of a physical barrier between the two. In the first video, the researcher did not explain the purpose or the importance of the study and did not sell the study to the participant. Furthermore, the participant had prior obligations and knew she would not have time to finish the interview, but the researcher missed the cues. From an observational standpoint, the researcher's body was closed off, she kept the clipboard high and did not engage with the participant. The major problem is failure to ask follow up questions from the initial big questions. The principle strength of qualitative research is the ability to tell an in-depth and rich story through the experiences of the participants. The videos did an excellent job showing what the researcher missed by not following the correct process in first video. Structured approaches does not mean the researcher cannot be fluid in their interactions, it just ensures efficiency and makes the overall interview more successful for the research topic.

Mark, Thank you for the good post. I likely feel that the well performed in-depth interviews look like the class context of interaction between the students and professor, more precisely between the lawyers and clients or doctors and patients. The attribute of these interactions would have a focus on how to draw the information honestly and fully to measure her subjects. If the qualitative interviewers perhaps could pursue a teaching position or consulting profession, the training and skills of interview seem relevant not only with the research, but also his vocational career as a whole. Once I said that the journal writings during the qualitative research process may later be used when they teach in the colleges and universities. The qualitative inquiry is very intimate and direct than quantitative studies not only for the students or general citizen, but also for the engineers of knowledge and learning. In this respect, I agree that the interview in the first video is disappointing. Respectfully. RSCH-8300P Discussion Post Week 7, Post 1: Video Interview I and II Mark Murray It was pretty clear that interview 1 was the \"bad\" interview and interview 2 was the more correct interview. Dr. Crawford was certain to violate almost all of her initial guidance provided during the opening of the first video along with a few new \"Bad practices\" to add to our collective list (Crawford 2010). During interview 1 the physical layout of the interview was poor; Dr. Crawford had her back to the door, the tape recorder cord was a tripping hazard and the table was a barrier between the two people and their chairs were the smaller 'kid' chairs that looked uncomfortable. These physical hurdles were impediments to building rapport (Crawford 2010). After interview 1 began there were three areas that violated the principles established by Dr. Crawford and the Patton text (2013); rapport, questioning technique and language. Aside from the physical impacts to rapport discussed above, Dr. Crawford did not establish clear expectations of the interview process or properly prepare for the interview. Dr. Crawford's questioning technique was also poor with several closed-ended questions used vice open ended ones (Janesick 2011). Dr. Crawford also missed several opportunities for follow-up questions and elaborations as well as trying to cram a question in at the end which was clearly not answered thoughtfully (Crawford 2010). She also set a tone that the interview was to facilitate Dr. Crawford' degree completion vice improving school morale. Interview two was a complete departure from interview 1; the physical issues were fixed with a smaller table, bigger chairs and no electrical cord to trip on (Crawford, 2010). The introduction and explanation of the interview process set the interviewee at ease with information and a friendly tone (Crawford 2010). The interviewer also provide additional details about how the data would be used, that the interviewee would have opportunities to edit the interview transcripts and add more details to ensure their story was correctly conveyed (Patton 2015). The use of questions was significantly better with multiple openended questions and a variety of probing techniques (Patton 2015). I noted several techniques that I would like to incorporate into my interview skill set. The first was asking for stories that revealed examples of what the interviewee is trying to explain (Crawford 2010). Another key was to ask for \"5 words that are key in this area\" (Crawford 2010). Finally, I really liked how the interviewer stated \"I am interpreting that as...\" as a means to ensure understanding (Crawford 2010). References Patton, M. (2015).

As seen, the emotional spheres and cognitive areas are different, and my questions may miss the cue from yielding more rich stories and information. It epistemologically is emotional to ask the perception or perhaps sensory impression of interviewees in its major receipt. The educational level of interviewee can be agile to return more elaboration on my questions, but it does not seem to work perfectly about the extent and quality of information. In that case, I plan to ask a follow-up question, \"Can you elaborate on the details and tell me your thought?\" This would be the point of skills to encourage the interviewees for more positive engagement and a vehemence of attitude as a collaborator.

The interviewer should be mindful of the effect on the interviewee as well as what types of questions they are asking to generate an illicit meaningful data (Laureate Education, Inc., 2010, Interviewing Techniques – Part I). Prompt: \"Describe for me someone you admire, either a historical figure or someone alive today. Explain why you selected this person and why you admire this person.\" Interview Protocol: Prior to interview, the researcher will set date, time and location of interview with interviewee's permission and agreement to participate in the interview. This information will be conferred via phone and in writing along with an agreed upon time/length of interview. In addition, the researcher will convey via phone and in writing the purpose of the interview and ask permission to take notes during the interview and record the interview. Prior to the actual interview beginning on agreed upon date and time, the interviewer will test audio/video equipment to make sure that it is operational. At the beginning of the interview on set date, time and location, the interviewer will do the following: 1. Stand to greet, shake hands and introduce themselves to the interviewee. 2. Allow the interviewee to introduce themselves. 3. Both interviewer and interviewee will sit a comfortable distance from each other, but close enough to communicate properly with each other. 4. The interviewer will thank the interviewee for taking their time out of their busy schedule and agreeing to be interviewed for the study. 5. Explain to interviewee what the study entails and why it is being conducted; thereby giving the interviewee adequate information about how the interview will proceed (Laureate Education, Inc., 2010, Interviewing Techniques – Part I). 6. Explain to interviewee and get agreement of length of interview and instruct the interviewee that the interviewer will only go over the time agreed up if the interviewee wishes and agrees to do so out of respect for the interviewee's time. 7. Explain to interviewee that the interviewer will take notes during the interview and record the interview with the interviewee's permission. 8. The interviewer will inform the interviewee that a transcript of the interview and a copy of the interviewer's notes will be provided to the interviewee for their review/approval in an effort to make sure that the interviewer captures the interviewee's story/comments correctly. 9. The interview will then begin with the research question used to engage and draw out the interviewee followed by open-ended interview questions, as well as establish a rapport and trust with the interviewee (Laureate Education, Inc., 2010, Interviewing Techniques – Part II). Research Question: How has the person you admire the most in life inspired you and why? Interview Questions: 1. Who is the person that you admire the most in life? 2. What has this done in life to inspire you? 3. Did this person inspire you in a negative way that turned positive? In other words, did this person do something negative in life that inspired you to do something positive with your life? 4. Can you give some examples/stories of how this person inspired you positively? 5. Can you give some examples/stories of how this person inspired you negatively? 6. Is there any information that you would like to share about this person that was not discussed or covered during this interview? These questions will be posed to 3 different classmates as part of a mini-project to better myself with interviewing techniques and strategies, as well as learn to properly prepare, work on my communication skills, generate meaningful data by asking questions in the right order, take good field notes, utilize best practices and avoid pitfalls (Creswell, 2013).

Your protocol seems intrigued and cost saving that can make your research efficient and productive. Often the admired person impacts positively on his or her followers. I may be curious that the negative aspect was put to the order as prior to the positive stories. In other words, the question 4 could be asked right after question 2, which may be followed by question3, 5. The negative stories might be little or absent in cases that could likely only complementary. Do you prepare any follow-up questions that encourage the interviewee to respond deeply and completely? Respectfully. Author: Genea Shoulders Date: Friday, July 17, 2015 11:25:01 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion 2 Week 7 Annette, Good survey posting. In some of your questions you ask two questions within the same question. For example, Did this person inspire you in a negative way that turned positive? In other words, did this person do something negative in life that inspired you to do something positive with your life? I would suggest that you only ask one question at a time because participants may either not answer the question or expand to long in which the rest of the survey may not complete. Also, you also ask participants to provide examples of how the person has influenced their life and so forth. As mentioned this may provide that participants skip or give to many examples for the question. Genea Author: Constance Cuttino Date: Thursday, July 16, 2015 7:38:30 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion 2 Week 7 Main Post Connie Cuttino With qualitative research interviews you try to understand something from the subjects point of view and to uncover the meaning of their experiences. Interviews allow people to convey to others a situation from their own perspective and in their own words (Kvale, 1996). Research interviews are based on the conversations of everyday life. They are conversations with structure and purpose that are defined and controlled by the researcher (Kvale, 1996). In reflection of the two videos we reviewed regarding interview methods it is without confusion that the second video depicted a much more effective and controlled interview which allowed her to gain the information needed based upon the questions posed. Just as the second video presented, the interviewer will be prepared so before the interview begins by creating a schedule, secure an appropriate space i.e. quiet, comfortable area and test all equipment to be used. It is with understanding that the interviewer has selected the persons to be interview through a process appropriate for the study and had been in contact with them on a steady basis regarding the actual interview. The protocol will be communicated via phone, email and written materials, it will also be briefly discussed before the interview commences so that everyone associated with the interview will be well-versed regarding protocol. The previous mentioned process will also include discussion of what media will be used i.e. video, tape recording etc. and all permissions i.e. interviewee consent, space etc. will be secured. Introductions will be conducted and the interviewee will be seated within the interview area. It is hopeful that the interviewer has established a good relationship with the interviewee during the pre-interview process and will then be able to further build the rapport during the interview process. The following questions will be posed to the interviewee: Main Question Posed-Think about a time(s) when you were inspired by someone either living or fictional. What do you admire most about them? Why? Interview Questions 1. Who is the person that you admire? Living/ Deceased/Fictional? 2. Why is this person someone you admire? 3. Has this person inspired you to do something to inspire others? If so, can you give an example of what was done? OR what might you consider doing the in the future? 4. Is there anything else you would like to share before we conclude the interview? Once the interview is over, the interviewer and staff (if applicable) will thank all participants. The research interview is characterized by a methodological awareness of question forms, a focus on the dynamics of interaction between interviewer and interviewee, and also a critical attention to what is said (Kvale, 1996). In the case of the Once the interview is over, the interviewer will let the interviewee know that ta copy of the completed interview will be provided to ensure that the information has been captured properly and to ensure they are informed of the findings.

Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks California, 1996 Hi. Constance, Thank you for the good post. First of all, I must convey my deepest condolence to the death in your family. I hope your time to handle with your family would be precious to rise up again, and expect soonest comeback to the class. My question, then, expectedly would remain unattended, and be available after you will come composed later. Your survey for the good interviewing is instructive to highlight the key elements for success. It is agreeable that the perspective of interviewees and their own words are a vital part of importance to constitute the data source. On the other, as you pointed out, the structure and purpose of conversations are to be defined and controlled by the interviewer. Then it is a threshold issue to be resolved that the interviewer should be skilled and specialized in the studies. Nevertheless, the big scale of interview schedules would require hiring the interviewers other than researcher himself. How do you prepare the hired interviewers to make the data collection most efficient and productive? Respectfully.

The only main suggestion that I have is that it is okay to use sub-questions with a main question. This would help in fleshing out more details about the individual that a person admires and challenges the interviewee to think critically and positively about the individual. Hello Genea. Reading, I can imagine an excellent job on your hand coding experience. It is a very important idea that the developers must first determine through convergence what words fit into the same theme or category. However, if you are word specific as appears in the text, you may have to miss a similar or same meaning, thought or feeling that the interviewees provided as a raw data. Nevertheless, it is unwise to increase codes, and especially problematic if you do themes or categories. It would create any hardly treatable post-data collection work. In other words, it could complicate the analysis and presentation of data. I suppose a premeditated structure of interview questions to be well organized sufficient to anticipate a code or key word clustered response only could save this situation. How do you adjust this possible challenge from the response containing a wide use of various words? I also like to know how to use your result on frequency of codes to finalize your presentation? Respectfully. [Week 8] Author: Genea Shoulders Date: Wednesday, July 22, 2015 5:18:01 PM EDT Subject: Discussion Main Post (Team: Genea) Gibbs and Taylor (2005) defined coding as the process of combining data into themes, ideas, and categories associated with the study (para.1). Following, developers can then mark similar passages with the same code label in the efforts to easily retrieve them later in the study. On the other hand, Creswell (2013) defined coding as placing textual information into smaller categories and then looking to databases to assign meaning and labels associated with the codes (p.184). Some examples of codes include events, activities, behaviors, and other observable characteristics. For example, the discussion board for this week sought to determine who the one person that students admire the most was. Although the assignment asked to compare data with our partner I was unable to do so and will only present my coding methods. Patton (2015) suggested that when more than one person in a group it is more appropriate for each person to independently code data and then compare against one another (p.554). The author then suggest that developers must first determine through convergence what words fit into the same theme or category. As mentioned above the proposed survey question asked \"Who is the one historical or living person that you admire the most?\" Prior to determining which coding structure I would use I decided to read over each survey and mark key words from each question in red. Patton (2015) described this process as the first in developing coding categories or classification systems (p.554). The author then suggest reading over the data a second time to formally code the data into systematic categories. After reading each survey I was then able to determine coding themes that arise throughout each survey question. Following, I counted the number of times like terms presented throughout each question. Although this method is easier than using qualitative software data it does present their own challenges. Huberman and Miles (1994) suggested the idea that developers use preliminary code counts of data codes and determine how frequently codes appear in the database. The categories that can be associated with survey response includes reflexive accounts, relationship, and the significance of the meaning assigned to the admirable person. I decided to go with these coding themes based on the concept that each survey response conveys a positive influence on the individual's life. Also, participants were asked to account for the one person who they admired the most which meant they had to dig deep into their mind set to decide such. Finally, participants were then asked to describe the relationship and impact that the individual had on their life. One of the challenged that I has when hand coding each survey was keeping account for key words that were associated with each survey question. For example, one of the response was very extensive but did not provide key words that I could place into themes that were developed from other surveys. I also found that two out of three surveys chose historical people as the person they admired the most. The quality issue associated with hand coding is accuracy in the number of times key terms appear within themes. Reference Creswell, J. W. (2013). Qualitative inquiry and research design (3rd ed.).

Hello Genea, You mentioned you count the number of times key terms appear. This is a possibility in the coding process discussed in the resouces for this week discussion (Patton, 2002, Creswell, 2013 and Gibbs and taylor, 2005). However, different terms or expressions can be used to convey the same meaning, thought or feeling. Did you face such a situation and how did you manage? Rodolphe Hello Mark and Wase, Thank you for the informative post. Your point about the advantage and disadvantage within the use of descriptive or more general terms seems likely many coding analysts would face as their challenge. If we put more focus on the data, the descriptive terms will be more salient. If he or she tends to get it more scholarly, the second choice could serve although the first way also has a value on its own. Once I found it very persuasive and entertaining to understand a Korean mind and their personality on the key words analysis from the interviews of selected public. It was not scholarly in exact sense, but sophisticated both at volume and ways of analysis. It used descriptive terms as transcribed in the interview response, and the frequency of codes is the standard of analysis in presenting their message of findings or themes. On the thesis or dissertation work, I suppose that the researcher may more likely to choose the general terms if he is more influenced or exposed in the stage of literature review. How is your prospective work gone in this consideration? In other words, are you more friendly with the coding based on the general terms? Respectfully. Author: Mark Murray Date: Wednesday, July 22, 2015 7:31:03 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 8 Hand Coding Data – Mark and Wase Comparison of coding structure and strategies Creswell (2013) opined that coding \"involves aggregating the text or visual data into small categories of information\" (p.184). Both researchers worked on the same data following the interviews conducted with peers. Following this exercise, the codes used by both researchers emerged from terms that seemed to \"best describe the information\" (Creswell, 2013, p. 185). Both researchers thought along the same lines by grouping major themes. It was actually very interesting to see how close both researchers were regarding the coding terms that were developed independently. Although there were a lot of similarities between the structure, and coding structure of both researches, differences of how coding was conducted emerged. One researcher color-coded the coding terms to identify when the interviewee was talking about themselves or the person they admired. This helped identify convergent terms and how they \"fit together\" (Patton 2013, pp. 554). Conversely, divergent terms became more evident and revealed patterns or categories that were likely not as accurate (Patton 2013, pp. 555). The other researcher used a series of numbers from 1-9 to indicate the occurrence of each term. Identifying high and low-use coding terms also helped distinguish convergent and divergent terms and identify patterns. Another interesting difference between the researchers was that one researcher grouped several areas together under two terms; 'disadvantage' and 'parental influence'. The other researcher used more descriptive and more explicit terminology such as 'childhood,' 'determination,' 'misadventure,' 'upbringing,' and 'obstacles'. The use of more descriptive terms was discovered to be a greater benefit in coding since it allowed more opportunities to \"Winnow\" out more specific data without dumping too much meaningful information (Creswell 2013, pp. 194). Analysis and discussion of the experience of hand coding and issues of quality Both researchers found the hand coding exercise very enriching. It was interesting to see similarities in the coding and to debate the pros/cons of coding terms and using more precise terminology versus more general terms. It was very easy to understand each other's perspective, and the rationale behind the terminology. Regarding issues of quality, both researchers were very thorough in analyzing the data. The text used for the coding exercise was chosen based on the data that was best suited to respond to the research question, notably the inherent qualities of human beings that trigger a high degree of admiration.

That may be a good practice that is considerate or prudent, but can spoil the adequate timing of dissemination or be inefficient deals with no trade-offs oftentimes.

Respectfully. Author: Mark Chakwin Date: Wednesday, July 22, 2015 12:43:11 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 8 Week eight initial post (Team Constance & Mark C.) Hi professor and colleagues! Coding structures and strategies Summary: Our team reviewed the three interviews and decided on an appropriate interview sample to code. Each of us coded separately and then each provided the other with the results. Our approaches and our codes were different! The Coding Exercise Coding A code in qualitative inquiry is \"most often a word or short phrase that symbolically assigns a summative, salient, essence-capturing, and/ or evocative attribute for a portion of languagebased or visual data\" (Saldaña, 2012, p. 3). Janesick (2011) describes eight steps for coding including carefully reading and summarizing the data, pre-coding to gain attention to \"codable moments\" primary coding and follow-up coding with adding categories and themes (pp.180-181). Team Approach In our team, each coder determined their own codes independently, although Saldaña (2012) recommends that researchers collaborate for team ventures and create an inter-coder agreement or an interpretive convergence in advance (p. 28). Creswell (2013) describes how multiple researchers can code independently and iteratively work to have a unified set of codes –using a common \"codebook\" to aid their research (p. 254). For this exercise, our codes and our methodologies were not pre-planned so that each of us could compare and learn from each other. In our results, one coder used 13 codes (with two multiple uses) and the other coder used seven codes (with six multiple uses). In Qualitative Research there is no correct number of codes to use. Creswell (2013) proffers his \"lean coding\" approach with very few codes and strives to keep the codes and themes to a small number. Saldaña (2012), however, notes that Lichtman (2006) states that 80-100 codes and 15-20 categories are not unusual for a first cycle coding (pp. 20-21). Our team's approach to coding also varied in philosophical approach as well. One team member identified codes in an inductive approach that often is associated with grounded theory --where coding \"is a procedure for organizing the text of the transcripts, and discovering patterns within that organizational structure\" (Auerbach & Silverstein, 2003, p. 31) (emphasis added). The other team member used the research question to guide the coding in alignment with a \"theoretical' thematic analysis\" (Braun & Clarke, 2006, p. 84). Observations Conducting independent coding on the same data, and without preparing an inter-coder agreement, revealed how much the individual researcher brings to a Qualitative Research project. Each team member diligently followed the \"guidelines\" or traits recommended by Saldaña (2012): to be organized, to persevere, to deal with ambiguity, to be flexible, to be creative, to be rigorously ethical, and to have and use an extensive vocabulary in analyzing the words and meaning of others (pp. 28-29). For this reason, we believe that the quality of our first cycle coding was high –and the results aligned with what our course material suggests that initial coding delivers. We discovered that the same facts and words were valued differently by each team member. Each created a slightly different picture out of the interview's content. We believe that neither coder's approach suffered from a lack of quality; nor was either approach better or worse. Each \"tuned\" the coding to his/her own experiences and research goals. As Braun and Clarke (2006) stated: \"What is important is that the theoretical framework and methods match what the researcher wants to know, and that they acknowledge these decisions, and recognize them as decisions\" (p. 80).

[Week 9] Author: Rodolphe Missinhoun Date: Wednesday, July 29, 2015 7:07:39 AM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 9 Main Question Post My proposed research design is a case study to describe in details how organizational culture shapes complementarity between public and nonprofit organizations, given their à priori intrinsic inefficiency, as nonprofit oriented. In the last week application, I mentioned that four types of data will be collected and analyzed to reach an appropriate tradeoff between breadth and depth as suggested by Patton (2002). These are documents, interviews, focus groups and audiovisual materials. The analysis will require an adequate mix of these data. Following Creswell (2013), the first step of the analysis will be to store data in a matrix form. The column will indicate the types of data and the line will comprise the forms of data (nonprofit interviews, public organization, beneficiaries, ect).This will give a first look of the complexity of the public nonprofit partnership nexus in delivering the public cash transfer. After several reviews, the data will be coded. The steps proposed by Stake (1995) and discussed by Creswell will be used, to reduce bias and improve quality and validity of findings. A categorical coding and analysis will be first done to identify instances for meaning-making. The direct interpretation will further be used by coding and interpreting each form of data. The meaningful themes/codes will be combined to shed light on consistent patterns. The patterns will be interpreted and analyzed, in line with the existing literature for naturalistic generalizations. The use of these steps will ensure to exploit each form of data in details as well as getting deep into their combination. As Creswell suggested, it is important that the specific case of public cash transfer itself be described in-depth in support to data collected from field. Given the various types of data to be considered, the use of software will be appropriate. As Creswell indicated, software facilitates data storing, manipulation and analysis. While it cannot substitute the researcher's judgment as cautioned by Patton (2002), it can serve for a better organization and management of data. The coding will be facilitated and the comparison and combination of the various forms of data can be eased. The complexity of the information can be investigated by relying on the software facility for data management. For instance, themes from beneficiaries' views can be easily compared with codes from nonprofit interviews. A variety of comparison can be conducted at once. References Creswell, J. W. (2013).

Do you think you will find more similarities or differences between the public or the private sector? Author: Rodolphe Missinhoun Date: Wednesday, July 29, 2015 3:07:36 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 9 I do not know about what will be the findings. What I think is that in the literature the nonprofit government partnership is politically attractive as a means to effectively deliver public policies. If this actually happens (and it does in the literature at some point), it would mean that there are some factors which contribute to that. In fact according to some existing literature, the nonprofit orientation of public administration may explain its inefficiency (for instance see Mises). Therefore, the question is how an other organization which is also said nonprofit oriented does come to complement public bureaucracy to lead to effectiveness. This is what I propose to explore. If the responses were known, thus there would no longer be any gap in the existing literarture and the study would not be justified. My point is that there are still more description and explanations to provide. I want to look some of these elements from the praticionners as well as beneficiaries' perspectives. The case study is then to explore how informants perceive the partnership and what it carries (as positive or negative) in their views. Rodolphe Hello Rodolphe and Ferron. Thank you for the informative post. Your assumption seems that public and nonprofit organizations are intrinsic of inefficiency and also will highly likely be so upon the completion of your research. Then you would like to know the types of failing or other version or rationale varying with such patterns or types? I believe that is interesting, but with the kind of exceptional success of public nonprofit organizations as you see. However, the problem arises of definition itself. To say, if for the exceptional success, how can we define them as nonprofit since they reap an amount of profit in an excess. Are they to clear their excess with the social redistribution, and return to their initial investment? Or are they to increase their capital –perhaps social or public –for reasons (the kind of strategic dimension)? They may come sacred to increase their provision of service because they find a possibility and prosperity or come to difficult to compete with other nonprofits or harshly with the same field of private for-profits. The interesting point, in my view, also would be how much the tendency can be charted in the share of public nonprofits or social capital across the period in comparison with the traditional forms of business organization. The effectiveness of delivery of service for the consumers is one important tenet in the fiscal federalism of US, in which the diffusion with various states system for provision of service to the citizens had been held as more effective and could increase the choices of citizens. Then we may hypothesize the kinds of rank order in delivery of service from the private profits, state and federal government in terms of effectiveness and increase of choice or preferences. While the public nonprofits are not exactly same with the state entity, we may sense together as to perform a similar role and pattern of behaviors. If the rise of social capital or public nonprofits is identified, they you may be comparative with the three rank order from the viewpoint of other themes or codes. For example, the public concept imposes an \"austerity\" or \"worship\" making them constantly improve their quality of service, which comes contrasted with the private driven firms and attracts the consumers. Or you may draw their \"specialization\" or \"professional training\" as a factor that brings a rise of public nonprofits. Or due to such \"focus of public opinion, press and media\" as well as \"intellectual sharing\" that explore any idealistic paradigm for the current capitalism. It seems very attractive that your interest has gone among the public non-profits. It also would be an interesting key word that you use \"complementarity\" to portray their mask and reality. Are you firm with your thesis in this stage? Thanks for the posting again. Respectfully, Kiyoung. Author: Chenwi Ngwa Date: Wednesday, July 29, 2015 8:38:25 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 9 Hello Chenwi, Ferron and Rodolphe. Thank you for reading my post and questions. The life of researchers may look like a vagabond in the bewildering and deserted Sahara? However, it is really fantastic to reflect on the computerized lesson of NVivo over the weeks in this class, which would be the kind of portable lamp in the hands of researcher. The hand coding work was good, but the transition to NVivo in this week likely evokes a friendly feel from the developer of software program. It is portable, perhaps with some application to IPod or others and so small, but plays an extensive role to store, manage, analyze the data and documents, and is suited to the work of researcher, such as visualizing and presentation. It seems the kind of oasis that now we are working on. KTV is the kind of public outlet with which the academics of Korean public administration interacts. I found it surprising that the young public officers of Korean government are so specialized and developed their expertise in their specific field . Their idea and ways of presentation is qualitative that raises an attention and mindedness of public for the area of their responsibility. If mom can be with Korean, I would suggest to view. Approaching the end of this course, I realized that the qualitative method is not only diverse in the methodological types, but also could be shared in major attribute. While he or she can appreciate the distinctiveness, the researchers can be an omnibus user over different approaches and methods of analysis upon the qualitative data that he collected. That can also be one point of consideration so as to make a best fit for the research plan. By the way, SPSS is exploitable without limitations of period in use, but not with NVivo? Have a good weekend. Kiyoung Thank you for the detailed research plan. Given that qualitative research takes a lot of time to analysis all the data that has been collected from the field, it is important to allocate enough time for the analysis phase of the study. This approach will examines ways of enhancing the quality and credibility of the qualitative analysis. Given the flexibility and varying strengths and weaknesses of the different qualitative analysis methods or approaches, the researcher uses different methods to investigate the same phenomenon, should not expect that the findings generated by those different methods will automatically come together to produce some nicely integrated whole. Indeed, the evidence is that one ought to expect that initial conflicts will occur between findings from the different qualitative data analysis methodologies and that those findings will be received with varying degrees of credibility. It is important, then, to consider carefully what each kind of analysis yields and to give different interpretations the chance to arise and be considered on their merits before favoring one result over another based on methodological biases. What do you think? Again, thanks for the great discussion post. Author: Ferron Yi Date: Wednesday, July 29, 2015 2:17:21 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 9 This is very interesting.

Rodolphe Author: Mark Chakwin Date: Thursday, July 30, 2015 5:28:57 AM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 9 Mark Chakwin week nine initial post. Hi Professor & Colleagues! Data analysis techniques for my qualitative research plan. Background: My planned Qualitative Research final project is a case study of a Sister City relationship. (A Sister City relationship is: \"When a community of any size decides to join with a community in another nation to learn more about one another, and to develop friendly meaningful exchanges...\" (Bell-Souder, Bredel, & Rodd, 2005, p. 2). These relationships are increasingly popular, but under-examined as to the (perceived) value that they actually bring to the participating city. An inquiry into \"the complex system dynamics\" (Patton, 2015, p. 8) will be done using a Purposeful/purposive sample (p. 265). The Data: The data I plan to collect includes: stakeholder perceptions and assessments via open-ended surveys, data describing the city's goals, actions and reactions about the Sister City relationship as found in relevant city official records; The feedback and opinions from the community and non-governmental stakeholder as provided in published documents, letters, web-blogs by non-governmental stakeholders in the participant city; and local (city) media reporting including: from newspapers, local TV and radio. These reports could include news, editorials, commentaries, or even advertisements related to Sister City activities. Seeking these sources aligns with practices recommended by Creswell (2013b, pp. 191192). Finally, I would conduct personal observations of Sister-city activities, so-called site visits according to Patton (2015, pp. 352-353). Analysis: According to Creswell (2013a), analysis is fundamentally a (1) preparing and organizing the data, (2) reducing the data into themes through a process of coding and condensing the codes, and (3) representing the data in figures, tables, or a discussion (p. 180). In practice these three steps are expanded and subdivided, or adjusted in different ways, depending upon which Qualitative approach is used. Moreover, these steps are not linear. Creswell (2013a) describes the Qualitative analytical process as \"all moving in analytic circles rather than using a fixed linear approach\" (p. 182). This case study of a single city (purposeful sample), lends itself to direct interpretation. For this approach, I will examine a single instance (city pair) and seek to elicit the meaning that can satisfy the research questions. In analytical terms, \"It is a process of pulling the data apart and putting them back together in more meaningful ways. Also, the researcher establishes patterns and looks for a correspondence between two or more categories (Creswell, 2013a, pp. 199-200). As noted above, this research will generate large amounts of multi-media and text records. There will be first-hand observations, and second and third party data, like that coming from open-ended questionnaires. Managing and analyzing these data will require computer aided analysis. This can be illustrated in simply considering the steps for coding. Janesick (2011) identifies eight steps for coding and theme development (pp. 180). In this case study, those eight steps will be multiplied (applied) to at least four different data types. These steps will then be multiplied by the amount of data for each type as well! The analytical challenge of managing the diversity and volume of data can be mitigated by using analytical software --like our courseware, NVIVO. These software programs allow us to: \"(1) quickly generate coding using auto-coding or queries, (2) find themes in your data using queries, (3) query your data and coding, (4) single project file that can be easily transported and shared with others, (5) add the ability to link, annotate, and create relationships, (6) add the ability to create models that are linked to the items they represent, and (7) to reshape and re-organize your coding and node structures quickly and easily\" (Buffet, 2007). Frankly speaking, computer software is the only facile technique to apply one standard for managing and analyzing diverse data formats and materials – often automatically! Saldaña (2012) addressed the enhanced functionality that software provides. He noted that using software \"...becomes vital for ... coding and [for] retrieval functions to work consistently and reliably. This is an almost essential condition for Qualitative Researchers\" (p. 29). OK, this was an overview of data analysis approach for my case study. Although analysis fundamentally requires only three steps (Creswell, 2013a), it is an extensive and complicated undertaking. Thank you for reading & have a great week!

Thank you for the excellent post. I also agree that NVivo is almost indispensable for the qualitative researchers. It seems a time of perfection when NVivo provides the kind of end result with the matrix of themes or codes. It would provide a catharsis of researcher in his sedulous work on the research topic and theme as well as tiring strolls of investigation. It also can reduce the bias with the objective computerized frame and subjective value of researchers. It is fanciful to dress up the raw data into the kind of scientific fashion. Your research topic is very attractive that we now consider the age of city politics. The kind of traditional politics on the state or might-of-nation based are unlikely to be intimate or practical for the vast of citizenry if not the diplomats or public officers at other scale of territory. Then I expect that your data analysis begins with the friendly exchange as you deposited initially, and the corroboration/legitimization occurs, by evaluating alternative explanations, disconfirming evidence, and searching for negative cases as Merill epitomized. Have a good weekend. [Week 10] Hello Genea, Thank you for the informative post. My gut had been a complete separation between quantitative and qualitative. It is vastly true, of course, but the kind of intersection seems due if minimal though. Deductive test or logical analysis, as you illustrated, may be one example that the qualitative researcher can reinforce his frame with the kinds of persuasive matrix. I had been presumed that the department of statistics had no interest with the qualitative nature of intelligence, but that the ads for the department on the open university simply thrust the word graphics of frequency from the NVivo. Upon the event of president speech in countries, we may see the reporter of next day newspaper presents the most frequently used words in it. How do you best exploit these utilities in dealing with your final research work? Good over the days. Author: Genea Shoulders Date: Wednesday, August 5, 2015 4:12:12 PM EDT Subject: Discussion Main Post Patton (2015) suggested developers conduct their research in one of two ways. Through inductive analysis researchers look for patterns that emerge from the text (p.560). Just process exist when developers create possible codes of categories by crossing one dimension with that of others. After developers must then work back and forth with the data in order to determine the complete matrix. On the other developers could work through a study deductively or the logical analysis process. Deductive research consist when developers force data into particular categories with the hopes of completing the matrix (Patton, 2015, p.561). For example, while working through the data a developer may use pre-existing coding categories but then come across the challenge of placing certain words into categories. At this time the developer may then force certain words into categories in which they do not fit. For the proposed mini-project I would consider evaluating the data based on the qualitative approach of grounded theory. Grounded theory suggest developers move past the descriptive phase of the data and more towards generating a theory based on the results of the study (Creswell, 2013,p.83). For example, when using the quantitative approach developers generally present a theoretical foundation and work the study based on such. On the other hand, qualitative researchers look to the data to generate a theory within the study. Based on the mini-project surveys I would seek to develop a relational theory that connects the participant to who they admire most. In order to prove quality, trustworthiness, and credibility within the mini-project I would employ tactics used by Creswell. Creswell (2013) provided readers with procedures to use when considering grounded theory. First, the literature review must provide bias or gaps that are presented within current literature as well as provide a rational for why just study needs further research. Second, throughout the writing developers must begin with something and then provide ideas about the sample, setting, and the data collection process. Third, developers must provide a reference for outside resources used to support the theoretical conclusion. Finally, within the discussion section developers must provide what their study failed to accomplish as well as what future developers should research and practice (Creswell, 2013, p.229). Although the results of the study were only based on one developers coding method evidence of quality did exist. The quality of the surveys can be based on the use of the NVivo software which eliminates hand coding and accuracy challenges. In order to ensure quality, trustworthiness, and credibility of my proposed qualitative research plan I would consider using the same if not similar tactics used for the mini-project.

Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. Hello Jennifer. Thank you for the excellent post. My feel about the research work likely would be presumed of microbiome within which the scholarly communications are interchanged. In that sense, your statement about \"nurtured through extended time,\" \"utility of peer review and member checking\" as well as paramount importance of \"high quality writing as clear and captivating.\" For the foreigners, the English teacher, therefore, stresses the importance of emerged learning that they zone the space of \"English only\" in their country. That serves breeding future English speaking scholars of foreign origin, and also likely facilitates the globalization with common neighbors. We now learn between the data and writing up stage, which may be implicating. The essential aspect of qualitative method is the kind of process to deal between the researcher and common neighbor, called participants, oftentimes. We have experienced broken English as a data from the foreign owner of Beauty Shop when we learnt the observation method and protocol. Nurturing over the extended time in the field is pertinent if we often say, immigrants of earlier age to the English speaking community, especially of undergraduate education, would better communicate and express as a native. Of course, the \"field\" in this case would be meant about the data collection and analysis and the subject issues of researcher. Even in this case involved with the native researchers, however, I consider the prolonged engagement probably would yield a written product that is more appealing and comes closer with the audience. It is seen very prospective that you have a good network for the peer review and member checking as if you can now comfort with the kind of micrbiome for your professional work. Do you plan to use the kind of websites, research net, academia or SSRN as your career progress? Have a pleasant day. Author: Jennifer Williams Date: Wednesday, August 5, 2015 8:44:49 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 10 Main Post When considering strategies to ensure the evidence of quality, trustworthiness, and credibility in my work, the very first one that comes to mind is the importance of high quality writing, free of grammatical and spelling errors. This may seem like an obvious expectation of scholarly writing, but it has been my personal experience that more often than not, students fall far below that expectation. Infusion of the correct writing style is also paramount to ensuring quality, trustworthiness, and credibility in one's work by virtue of the fact that if the writing is not clear and captivating, the reader will quickly lose interest and dismiss the project. While these are personal strategies that I have adopted over time, there are additional strategies found in our text that provide guidance on the importance of quality, credibility, and trustworthiness. Creswell (2013) offered that the researcher's close rapport with participants, nurtured through extended time in the field, increases the credibility and trustworthiness of the research. The author went on to include the researcher's rich descriptions of data and his or her frank acknowledgement of researcher bias as contributing factors to the credibility of the researcher and transferability of the findings. Triangulation is yet another strategy encouraged by Creswell (2013) as a means of strengthening credibility by utilization of a variety of \"sources, methods, investigators, and theories to provide corroborating evidence\" (p. 208). Each of these strategies is important to ensuring the credibility and trustworthiness of the findings and will certainly be included in my research project. In addition, I am a huge proponent of the strategies described by Creswell (2013) as peer review and member checking. The practice of member checking is crucial to ensuring that the presented data is reflective of the participant's reality. Soliciting periodic feedback from participants regarding the language, themes, and interpretations of the data is a sure way to increase the accuracy of the research and thereby lend credibility to the findings. This strategy was quite helpful during the interview assignment when I shared with the three participants the codes and themes that were identified as significant. Participants were able to clarify their language and intent and were free to correct any assumptions made on my part. Also helpful during the interview assignment was the peer review strategy. This is a strategy that I have come to rely upon since beginning this doctoral journey, and one that will be included in my mini project. My peer reviewer is a fellow scholar that I met at my first residency. She and I often share our work for the purpose of critique and honest feedback. Although there are times when we agree to disagree, I can honestly say that my writing and reasoning has greatly improved due to her honest and sometimes brutal feedback. References Creswell, J. W. (2013). Qualitative inquiry and research design: Choosing among five approaches (3rd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc. Hello Ashley. I have enjoyed reading your post. Your mention, citing Creswell, had a great deal of implications that the researchers would ultimately be eventuated for the \"knowledge claims.\" The originality of contributions with the journals and dissertation work as well as research ethics of anti-plagiarism and protection of copy right would likely stem from this aspect of intrinsic. I suppose that the researchers' awareness of this context is better effective than thousands of instructional warnings or classes of research ethic. How do they claim their work as a new knowledge that perhaps was toiled to dig up, but that altered their time and labor to nothing? Several months ago, one professor with the duty of government project on the research ethics delivered a lecture in my workplace. She was a female professor from the Ho-seo University and amused us with demeaning words, but very pointing to the status of researchers. W.S. Hwang once had been one of world renowned stem cell researchers that had served the Seoul National University. He was accused to falsify the data and alleged to do wrong in terms of the professional standard of research. He had been one of Korean heroes, but had to retire with public pressure. Her focus of statement freezed the atmosphere of audience that the editors of global research journals had turned down a submission from his last name, Whang, regardless of the merits and acceptability, over a certain period of time. In this case, the impact of false knowledge claims not only harms the researcher himself, but also can produce innocent victims. The victims would not only Koreans since the last name also would be used in China. Thank you again for the excellent post, and have a pleasant day. Author: Ashley Reed Date: Thursday, August 6, 2015 7:12:19 PM EDT Subject: Main Discussion Post Evidence of Quality in Qualitative Research Quality, trustworthiness, and credibility are interconnected. They all are imperative to the Qualitative Research Method Design. These components ensure validity and reliability are present. Moreover, trust worthiness and credibility provide confirmation of quality. Collectively, they ensure good value of the research. Ensuring Quality How valuable is your research? This is the question posed by challenging quality. According to Creswell (2009), in such study a researcher make knowledge claims based primarily on \"Constructivist Perspectives\" in which a researcher consider the most relevant, qualified, and accurate information are used to enhance the overall value or worth of the study (p.18). In other words, the researcher ensures validity based on constructive evidence and proof. I t is clear quality is imperative in Qualitative Research. Good quality accounts for the sufficient evidence of outcomes that stems from the research. It is a helps shape the study through means of ensuring all components of the researcher are appropriately carried out. It affords the researcher the opportunity to go over results to ensure no discrepancies occurred and to make certain the researcher has presented the most accurate data. Also, trustworthiness and credibility helps the overall quality of the research by providing proof of what was revealed or concluded. Ensuring Trustworthiness Creswell (2009) indicates that using literary sources in qualitative research creates trustworthiness among researcher and participants because not much has been written on the study at hand. In this case, the researcher relies on listening to participants in an effort to build an understanding of what is taking place in the study or occurrence based on their perspectives and responses. Hence, such relationship requires trust. The research must trust that the participant is providing the most accurate data. Meanwhile, the participant must trust that the researcher will protect confidential information and provide the most accurate interpretation of their information. Moreover, qualitative research is not numerical in nature. Therefore, it requires the use of participant viewpoints, interview, observation sample, etc. Trustworthiness to ensure that any component of the research is not fabricated. It maintains that the research is dependable and that it can be truthfully confirmed. Hence, different researchers may gather results on the same study. However, each researcher must be truthful in presenting all accurate details results that fashion the overall outcome of their study. In other words, ensuring that their own individual and unique research could be confirmed or validated by others. Credibility The qualitative researcher's job is to explain a phenomena. Hence, they use the inferences gathered from participant's experiences or perspectives to understand the phenomena's who can be identified as the ultimate critic of the credibility of results. Participants involved in interviews or observations can serve as credible sources because they are involve in the study and are the ones directly or indirectly providing information. Also, credibility is the foundation that build results of the study under investigation ensuring it is trustworthy or reliable based on those involved in the research such as the participants. There are a numerous sources of data that could assist in the Qualitative Research collection process. Being Reliable, truthful, and trustworthy should be the characteristics of the selected sources (Research and Evidence, 2013). For instance, credible sources can be corroborated through expertise i.e. peerreviewed journals in which the Researchers credentials can help ensure quality research. According to Research and Evidence (2013,) it is important verification of the Reacher credentials and how recent the source are is imperative for the overall research and presentation of accurate data.

The selection of method occurs between the quantitative and qualitative or mixed methods in the first, and next about the different approaches within the qualitative studies. Since some research problem can only be uniquely addressed by the qualitative studies, the first challenge may seem less imposing. Your idea on the Ukraine Crisis and Crimean change of sovereignty seems fairly productive that both approaches would be combined to create your frame of qualitative studies. Are your research design ultimately purported to yield a theory as within the grounded theory approach or mixed nature of write up between two approaches? Although the research plan is excellent enough as informed from the high impact case studies and grounded theory, the practical challenge in the data collection stage can be present as you note. What are your strategies to handle them? Have a good day. Author: Mark Murray Date: Tuesday, August 11, 2015 10:50:12 PM EDT Subject: RE: Discussion Week 11 RSCH-8300P Discussion Post Week 11: Blending and Adapting Approaches Mark Murray Blending and Adapting the Approaches: Dr. Knightly-Lynn (2010) outlined that the goal of research design is to develop what is needed to validly answer the question. The key is to identify what aspects of research design are the most appropriate to meet your objectives. However, these decisions must first be grounded in your knowledge of the different approaches. After attaining a full understanding of the qualitative paradigm and the different approaches, then the researcher can combine different aspects such as the analysis of one approach with the data collection method of another\" (Knightly-Lynn 2010). When attempting to blend multiple approaches for my particular research method, I think of combining the deep level of understanding and use of documentation for data collection of the high-impact case study with a grounded theory approach based in selfdetermination theory (Creswell 2013). Using a high impact case study allows me to focus on the volume of documentation that exists for an event like the Ukraine Crisis and the Crimean change of sovereignty. Using this documentation will take the place of interviews and survey tools that could be manipulated by local groups or potentially endanger respondents who could be targeted for the participation by political groups bent on solidifying control in Crimea. Combining this documentation with the grounded theory process of \"Analyzing actions and processes rather than themes and structure\" in order to develop a theory that explains events (Patton 2015).

I agree that any more creative method could be employed if it can most finely address the intent and research goals as you stated, \"traversing of the proverbial methodological aisles or amalgamation of different methods.\" Across the surf over the dissertations or articles, for example, I also realized that the chapters may not pattern after the dominant practice or some vanguard-type for the data collection or ways of presentation. I sensed if the methodology would ultimately be valued for easier, appealing and educative or informative communication with the audience or supervisor. When blending occurs, what is your strategy to enhance the persuasion and educative effect of research article? Have a good day. Clement Nwagbara Qualitative Research: Blending and Adapting the Approaches Perhaps, the most general blending and adapting of research approaches that I know is the traversing of the proverbial methodological aisles, and amalgamating qualitative and quantitative approaches into the mixed methods approach. Creswell (2009) defines mixed methods research as \"an approach to inquiry that combines or associates both qualitative and quantitative forms. It involves philosophical assumptions, the use of qualitative and quantitative approaches, and the mixing of both in a study\" (p. 4). Researchers do not usually \"see\" research questions or hypotheses specifically adapted to mixed methods. Therefore, a mixed methods research question is often called a 'hybrid' or 'integrated' question. The question directly addresses the mixing of the methods, and the mixing informs and guides the study, which answers the research questions (p. 138). When the need for showing quality in research arises, the mixed methods approach is a way of harnessing the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative approaches; it also addresses interdisciplinary complexities; and enhances \"insight and expanded understanding of research problems\" (p. 203). However, I consider quasi-experimental designs also as blended, well-nigh, in the manner of mixed methods. In this design, researchers are able to conduct their studies \"in natural, real-life settings,\" but use probability samples to increase \"the external validity of their studies\" (Frankfort-Nachmias & Nachmias, 2008, p. 133). A research study could also utilize in combination multiple sampling strategies and multiple types of data, as shown in triangulation and the variety of forms thereof: data triangulation, investigator triangulation, theory triangulation, and methodological triangulation. All these are strategies of blending and adapting in research studies: \"mixing data, design, and analysis approaches\" (Patton, 2015, pp. 316-319). References Creswell, J. W. (2009).

Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. Hello Mark, Thank you for the informative post. I would truly be done with the statement, \"lesstheoretical wrinkle to considering research approaches\" or \"if researchers are focused on useful and actionable answers...the method decisions [will be] based on the situation and opportunities that emerge rather than...a pure paradigm. Although we have an extent of methodology classes in course design, that would be working to analyze other articles as a peer reviewer or supervisor when we serve as a referee of journals or so. In that case, perhaps most important considerations would be how the research article has been generated that provides a clear cut to assess the quality of contribution. However, the angle might be other way as involved with the producers of research piece. The researchers honed into their problem may perform well with a less faltering with the squeezing problem of research method or approaches. Actually the methodology classes are sophisticated and rigidly framed with the purpose of instruction that your illustration of methodological flexibility with Patton's likely is adequate. Do you consider how much the incongruity can matter purely with the issues of methodology or approach other than the purpose of research or pragmatic service? Have a good day. Mark Chackwin Week 11: Initial Post Hi Professor and Colleagues! How and when research approaches could be blended or adapted. Knight-Lynn (2012) suggests that \"A qualitative study does not necessarily need to fit squarely within a specific approach\" and different research methodologies can been blended or adapted and used together if the specific case or question could be better answered by doing so. She also noted that a firm understanding or good grounding in the various methods is essential to applying this practice and notes this can involve multiple methodologies within one method (for example several of the five techniques we have studied in Qualitative Research, or doing the same in Quantittiave Research. This is also manifest in Mixed Methods, which as a method calls for that. Patton (2015) also presents an insightful consideration of research flexibility. He posits five different purposes for research and note how each purpose shapes the research –and the methodology, in a different way (p. 248). He also adds a less-theoretical wrinkle to considering research approaches –pragmatism. If researchers are focused on \"useful and actionable answers...the method decisions [will be] based on the situation and opportunities that emerge rather than...a pure paradigm\" (p. 153). Blaxter, Hughes, and Tight (2010) note that it is common for researchers to use more than one method (p. 85). She notes that research as a group promotes this approach. In addition the need for diverse material and examinations of social science issues frequently require multimethod approaches to answer questions. This comports with Patton (2015, p.248) who notes that the standards for research products varies depending upon its purpose –as the research product varies, so too the methods needed will vary or be combined. The flexibility of Qualitative Research is deceiving, however. It is not simply a matter of having multiple methodologies available to use or apply. Rather, it is the challenge of identifying the clear purpose for research and honing accurate and meaningful questions that together will guide the researcher to an approach –or approaches that can best answer the questions and best fulfill the purpose of the research.

Perry (, ) presents his case with a celebrated example: \"I once followed a trail of sugar on a supermarket floor, pushing my cart down the aisle on one side of a tall counter and back the aisle on the other, seeking the shopper with the torn sack to tell him he was making a mess. With each trip around the counter, the trail became thicker. But I seemed unable to catch up. Finally it dawned on me. I was the shopper I was trying to catch.\" Before his epiphany, the shopper has a belief about himself (under the individuating concept or mode of presentation the shopper with the torn sack) to the effect that he is making a mess. This, however, is insufficient for him to have the reflexive, self-conscious belief that he would express in accepting 'I ammaking a mess', the one that leads him to rearrange the torn sack in the cart. I find it adequate to classify theories of singular thought in two camps (cf. GarcíaCarpintero, a), relative to whether they allow for it to constitutively feature descriptive content. Millian theorists (cf., e.g., Soames ) appeal to extensions of Russell's non-descriptive acquaintance relation to account for singular thought; true aboutness is, on the Millian view, constituted by some relation (perception, memory, testimony) non-descriptively linking the subject and the object of reference. Fregean theorists (cf., e.g., Hawthorne & Manley ) are typically latitudinarians who reject this, allowing for descriptively constituted singular thoughts. The messy shopper might already have a singular belief before his epiphany on the Fregean view, but not on the Millian one. However, as Perry (, ) points out, it will not help simply to espouse theMillian view: \"Suppose there were mirrors at either end of the counter so that as I pushed my cart down the aisle in pursuit I saw myself in the mirror. I take what I see to be the reflection of the messy shopper going up the aisle on the other side, not realizing \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, //, SPi  manuel garcía-carpintero that what I am really seeing is a reflection of myself.\" Given that he is perceiving himself in the mirror, the Millian view now allows for the shopper to have a de re belief about himself, to the effect that he is making a mess; but this still falls short of the reflective, self-conscious belief manifested by acceptance of 'I am making a mess', and the act of cleaning up. Lewis () presents a much discussed example involving two gods, one on the tallest mountain throwing down manna and the other on the coldest mountain throwing down thunderbolts, who, though omniscient about nonself-locating information, do not knowwhere they are in their world. Castañeda () has another famous example featuring an amnesiac war hero who reads a detailed biography without realizing that he is its subject. Cases like these additionally suggest that rich descriptive concepts are not only insufficient, but also unnecessary; for the amnesiac is able to think thoughts about himself in a fully self-conscious reflexive way, by using and understanding \"I\" and related expressions for first-personal reference while knowing precious little about himself. These examples raise the problem of de se thought-to wit, how to characterize it so as to give an accurate account of the data, tracing its relations to singular thoughts in general. After rehearsing the main tenets of two contrasting accounts-a Lewisian one and a Perrian one-in the first section of this chapter, in the second I will present a proposal of my own, which is a specific elaboration of the Perrian account. In the first section I will indicate some weaknesses of Perry's presentation of his view; the proposal I will articulate in the second overcomes them. I will conclude with a brief discussion of reasons for preferring one or another account, in particular regarding the issue of the communication of de se thoughts, but that will not be the main focus of the chapter. . De Se Thoughts: Two Conflicting Accounts Propositional attitudes and speech acts are individuated by representational contents that are traditionally assumed to be shareable between thinkers and have absolute truth-values (given a full specification of a possible way for the world to be, contents thus understood acquire a definite truth value with respect to it).1 I will call such contents 'propositions'.2 Propositions can be simply identified as classes of possible worlds, those with respect to which they are true.Thus, in believing that snow is white one representsworlds inwhich snow iswhite, and places the actual world among them. Lewis and Perry take de se thoughts to question this picture. 1 These are the two assumptions abandoned by the two rival accounts of de se thoughts that Perry () discusses before advancing his own, allegedly compatible with the traditional view of propositions; cf. also Perry (, ). I argue below that Perry's account is insufficiently developed and leaves important questions unanswered; and that, if developed along the lines I'll suggest, we get a form of the \"limited accessibility\" doctrine that rejects the second tenet of the traditional view. (Not that he would disagree; cf. Perry (, ; , ).) 2 This is a mere terminological decision; one might use \"proposition\" in the neutral way in which I use \"content\", and then call de se contents thus. \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, //, SPi token-reflexive presuppositions and the de se  Lewis rejects the traditional theory, taking contents to be properties instead of propositions; Sosa () and Chisholm () advance essentially the same view. Contents would be entities that are true or false, given a full characterization of a way for the world to be, only relative to a subject and a time. Alternatively, the contents of propositional attitudes are, or at least select, not classes of worlds, but rather classes of centered worlds: worlds with a designated subject and a time. In coming to believe what he would express by accepting \"I am making a mess\", Perry locates himself among all subjects making a mess at a given time and world. On the traditional conception of contents the actual world is not typically part of them (unless, say, they are the propositions expressed by an utterance including \"actually\").3 In believing a proposition one ascribes it to the actual world at which the believing occurs; it is the attitude of believing, or the act of judging, which, as it were, as part of their \"illocutionary\" nature, fixes theworld at which the belief occurs as the one relevant for the evaluation of the truth of the belief. A mere imagining with the same content would not similarly bring the actual world to bear, because imaginings are not constitutively evaluated as true or otherwise relative to whether the actual world at which the imagining occurs is correctly represented by their contents. Similarly and by analogy, on the Lewisian property view it is the attitude of believing itself, as opposed to its content, which brings to bear the subject and time relevant for the evaluation of its truth or falsity. Subjects who come to believe what they would express in English by uttering \"I am making a mess\" believe the same contents, in the way that subjects who believe at different worlds that snow is white believe the same contents. It is the attitude of belief that, as part of its illocutionary force, fixes the subject of the attitude and the time and world at which this attitude is entertained as the ones relevant for the truth-evaluation of the belief.This provides a nice solution to the initial problem of de se thought. If no conception of the subject (including those allowing for de re thought onMillian stances) appears to be sufficient for de se thought, and none appears to be needed, this is because the subject is not represented as part of the content, but is brought to bear for purposes of evaluation by the act of judging itself, not by its content. Let us move now to Perry's alternative state view. We should distinguish, Perry contends, the content of a belief from the belief-state through which it is accessed. The content is a proposition-say, that Perry is making a mess. The state is a condition of the subject, by being in which the content is believed. Contents answer to the role that propositional attitudes constitutively have in appraising the rationality of the subject, the adequacy of his beliefs to his evidence and of his actions to his beliefs and desires, the value of his desires, etc. But only, on Perry's view, in a coarse-grained way: a full account of rational action needs to mention not just the content, but 3 For a dissenting view, cf. Schaffer (). In putting the point in this way, I am assuming a \"structured proposition\" framework, corresponding to Lewis's description of contents as properties (as opposed to centered possible worlds). \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, //, SPi  manuel garcía-carpintero also the state through which the content is accessed. The above cases involving de se thoughts show that traditional contents are not enough to appraise rationality and cognitive significance; ways of accessing them should also be taken into consideration. On Perry's view, this is just a particular case of what obtains in Frege's puzzles in general: exactly the same lesson should be learned concerning the different cognitive significance of \"Superman flies\" and \"Clark Kent flies\", or \"Hesperus is visible in the afternoon\" and \"Phosphorus is visible in the afternoon\". Belief-states themselves must hence have some kind of meaning or significance if they are to have a role in appraising the rationality of actions or inferences. In his original account, Perry () appeals to Kaplan's () distinction between character and content to characterize the significance of states. Utterances of \"he is making a mess\" and \"I am making a mess\" might have, in their contexts, the same singular content, but they have different characters. Similarly, the messy shopper's belief-state when he looks at what is in fact his own reflection in the mirror, and later when he catches up, are different states with the same content; given the differences in rational action to be expected from one and the other, states themselves must have a role in the explanation of action, the appraisal of the rationality of the subject and the cognitive significance of the belief in virtue of their character-like meaning. Stalnaker (, –) questioned Lewis's account and the one by Perry just sketched on the grounds that they cannot give the most straightforward account of exchanges of information involving utterances with essential indexicals. He went on to advance an alternative account appealing to the \"diagonal propositions\" that he () had introduced earlier. Now, in spite of the efforts of Stalnaker and others, there are very good reasons not to take possible worlds as primitive entities in our semantic endeavors. It is perfectly OK, in my view, to use them as a semantic tool, and not just for instrumental reasons; the presence of modal expressions in our languages, in addition to the need to account for semantically grounded modal notions like logical validity, sufficiently establishes that. But possible worlds need not be primitive entities. They might be determined by structured propositions. I also think we find it easier to think in terms of such propositions. Thus I will not present Stalnaker's considerations in terms of diagonal propositions, but instead in terms of what I take to be the finergrained token-reflexive structured propositions that have them as their intensions or \"modal profiles\".4 Let us imagine a variation on Perry's supermarket story in which, contemplating the situation and realizing what is going on, a benevolent shopper tells him what is happening, which leads to the shopper's epiphany. He thereby comes to accept \"I am making a mess\" after being told \"you are making a mess\". On Perry's original view the contents of the beliefs thereby expressed are the ordinary, coarse-grained de re propositions which are conveniently identical for the two utterances. However, as we 4 García-Carpintero () provides further elaboration. \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, //, SPi token-reflexive presuppositions and the de se  know, this singular content does not account for what the shopper comes to know after the epiphany: he already believed it beforehand. Nevertheless, it seems that whatever explains his distinctive behavior after the epiphany was, in this variation of the story, communicated to him by the other shopper's utterance. How could Perry's or Lewis's proposals account for this?The character-like content of the Perrian state expressed by the shopper's utterance, \"you are making a mess\", is very different from that of the sentence by means of which the shopper would express his acquired knowledge, \"I am making a mess\". The Lewisian properties that the samaritan shopper and themessy shopper rationally self-attribute (addressing someone who is making a mess; making a mess) differ. Otherwise put, it would be absurd for the messy shopper to self-ascribe the property that the samaritan shopper expresses on the Lewisian view. For Lewis and Perry to deal with this consistently with their accounts, they should elaborate them so as to explain how it is that, in virtue of what the samaritan expresses, the shopper comes to learn something new. On the simplest account of successful communication, the episode should be explained by the messy shopper learning the very same content that the samaritan expressed.5 This \"belief-transfer\" model of Communications is what Stalnaker's account in terms of diagonal propositions (token-reflexive contents, in a structured proposition account) purports to offer. We can think of the meaning of indexicals like \"I\" or \"you\" as token-reflexive rules, which, given a particular token, fix its referent relative to some contextual property: being the speaker who produced it, or its (most salient) addressee. This provides a descriptive conception of the referent; in the case of the samaritan's utterance of \"you are making a mess\", we have a tokenreflexive conception associated with the particular case of \"you\", the addressee of that token.6 Both the samaritan shopper and the messy shopper can share this way of representing the latter. So this is an ordinary content, determining a traditional proposition, which is communicated fromone to the other: the onewe could explicitly articulate with \"the addressee of that token of 'you' is making a mess\". Perry () accepts that these token-reflexive contents provide a better representation of the significance of belief-states than the non-propositional one he had earlier advanced in terms of Kaplanian characters. But as he () explains, this refined version of his account can be taken in two different ways, only in one of which it is at least prima facie successful as a way of accounting for de se thoughts. Let us examine this carefully. On the first interpretation, the proposal is to think of what in Perry's earlier account was the character-like significance of belief-states as the proper contents of de se attitudes. The proposal would thus be to take token-reflexive propositions as the con5 This is the most straightforward version of what Pagin () calls the classical view, and Egan () the belief-transfer model of communication. 6 I have discussed the role of these contents in detail elsewhere (, , ); the elaboration of Perry's account I offer in the next section borrows from these previous discussions. \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, //, SPi  manuel garcía-carpintero tents of de se attitudes, capable by themselves of accounting for the data on traditional views on psychological explanation. I think this is the way Stalnaker took his proposal. However, taken in this way, for reasons Perry (, –) convincingly states, it does not work. The reason is that it is possible to reproduce the original problem, now with token-reflexive contents. The very same token-reflexive propositions can be accessed in different ways, and, in some of them, they could not possibly have the rational role that de se thoughts do. Thus, for instance, the messy shopper can hear the samaritan's utterance of \"you are making a mess\", without realizing for whatever reason that it is addressed to him (perhaps the samaritan is behind him), but accepting on its basis that its addressee is making a mess at the time. The samaritan's utterance would have the token-reflexive content we have been considering; but accepting it could not have the epiphanic role that accepting the samaritan's utterance had for the messy shopper in our variant of the story. On the second interpretation-the one that Perry subscribes to-the proposal is just a refined way of understanding the significance of belief-states; but an adequate account of de se contents (of the nature of attitudes and speech acts in general) still requires the distinction between belief-contents and belief-states (ways of accessing the content). The modification of Perry's original proposal lies only in that now the significance of belief-states is taken to be specifiable in the traditional propositional way that token-reflexive contents afford.My own proposal aims to develop this second interpretation, allowing us to understand better how states have cognitive significances and why that helps with our problems. Stalnaker (), who was espousing the first interpretation,7 was well aware of Perry's objection.He dealswith it by appealing to the holism that he attributes to beliefstates. Thus, even though in accepting the samaritan shopper's utterance of \"you are making a mess\" in both versions of the story (with and without the realization that he is the addressee) Perry may well accept the same proposition, his full belief-state in each case can hardly be the same.The goal of the account is then that of characterizing full belief-states. More recently (, –; cf. also his contribution to this volume) Stalnaker recants, providing an account in the spirit of the second interpretation that replicates Perry's distinction between content and state with a formally elegant centered-worlds apparatus.8 7 Among other things, this is clear in that, as I will explain shortly in the main text, only on the first interpretation can the proposal solve the communication problem along traditional lines. 8 Holism does not suffice to deal with Lewis's two gods example, because they are supposed to be equally omniscient relative to traditional propositional knowledge. Stalnaker (, –) appeals to haecceitism (positing qualitatively indiscernible different worlds) to deal with the case, rejecting as incoherent an objection made by Lewis that this does not solve the problem-to assume the coherence of the objection, he suggested, is just to beg the question against his proposal. In more recent work (, –, and his contribution to the present volume) he is less sanguine about the incoherence of Lewis's objection. To motivate his change of heart, in his contribution to the present volume (cf. his Albert & Boris example) he develops a point that Weber (, ; cf. also his contribution to the present volume) also makes, namely, that even when the gods' ignorance is eliminated and (given their omniscience) they come to accept a proposition including only the actual world, they still have different cognitive perspectives on the world. \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, //, SPi token-reflexive presuppositions and the de se  Adopting the second interpretation thus evades the straightforward objection to the first, but it raises thorny issues of its own. The most serious one is that we need to explain how is it that states themselves have cognitive significances, and how such cognitive significances interact with those encoded by their contents. Perry usually talks at this juncture about different \"classificatory practices\" we have for representational states/acts, relative to different purposes. He argues that states are mental particulars thatmay be classified by their \"official contents\" (the coarse-grained singular propositions, in our examples) but also by a plurality of other finer-grained propositional contents, useful for different explanatory purposes. This might suggest an unwelcome instrumentalist stance. Cognitive significances should rather flow, I think, from constitutive features of the explanatory posits themselves. In any case, the appeal to taxonomical practices is itself in need of further elaboration.9 We also need a justification for preferring a Perrian state view to the Lewisian property account. Stalnaker's criticism of Lewis's and Perry's proposals was not that they cannot account for the transmission of information in cases like the one we were considering-correctly so, because they could indeed do so.10 The objection rather was that the view that it is the token-reflexive content that is communicated affords a simpler classical explanation, compatible with the \"belief-transfer\" model. But this would be so only if we adopted the first interpretation of Stalnaker's proposal, which, as we have seen, we should reject. Once we stick to the state/content distinction, this virtue is lost; for shared content (be it the singular proposition that Perry is making a mess, or the token-reflexive proposition) is not explanatorily relevant, while the truly explanatory belief-states accounting for the samaritan shopper's utterance and the messy shopper's acceptance have different significances. In the former's state, he is presented as one addressing a messy shopper with a produced token of \"you\"; in the latter's, as one addressed as a messy shopper by an attended token of \"you\". The classical model of communication cannot hence offer any basis for preferring the state view; the defender of the Perrian account is as much in need of an alternative account of de se communication as defenders of the property view.11 As I explain below, the main concession Stalnaker needs to make is that holism is not a folk-psychologically adequate way of understanding rationalizing explanations. 9 Cf. Perry () for hismost developed presentation so far; cp. his use of the distinction above between the first and second interpretation of the role of token-reflexive contents in accounting for de se phenomena, to deal with general Fregean cases in de re beliefs Perry (, –). Some passages are at least suggestive of the presuppositional account provided below; cf. for instance his appeal to belief-like states that are not quite beliefs, just \"positive doxastic attitudes\" (Perry , ), and passages likes this: \"Whenever we ask about the conditions under which some act or project will succeed, we take certain facts as given. What we want to know is what else, what additional facts, have to obtain, for the thing to have that property, given the facts we assume\" (Perry , ). 10 Ninan (), Torre (), and Weber () offer accounts in the centered worlds framework; see also the contributions by Kinderman, Maier, Recanati, and Stojanovic to this volume. 11 Kinderman also stresses these points in his contribution to this volume. \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 OUP CORRECTED PROOF – FINAL, //, SPi  manuel garcía-carpintero In the next section I will offer an elaboration of Perry's proposal that aims to deal with these worries, providing a defense of the state view vis-à-vis the property alternative.12 . States and Contents: the Presuppositional View In previous work (cf. García-Carpintero (, , )) I have defended an account of singular terms that is an elaboration of the state view.13 The proposal offers a general account of Frege cases. This is as it should be because, as it was obvious to Castañeda, Chisholm, Lewis, Perry, and Sosa-whose accounts of de se thoughts are all part of general accounts of singular attitudes-and was pointed out by many other writers (cf.
